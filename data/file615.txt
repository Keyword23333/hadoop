6150219 no services are being used the property is completely empty why should we pay more than 1 000 a year
6150220 i am actively trying to sell the property but its a difficult time with the markets and on top of that it is sheltered housing
6150221 when i complained to the council they said we can have a 10 per cent reduction if i put furniture in but after doris died we took out everything it is obscene when you consider a single person receives a 25 per cent reduction i am extremely angry about this
6150222 it is a difficult enough time for doriss family and friends without this the council said if there is not enough funds to cover the bill we can pay it when the property sells but its the same thing and the beneficiaries will lose out
6150223 when a property has transferred into the names of the executors of the will the council tax exemption that was granted to the deceased person ends and the estate is liable for council tax charges the property is treated the same as any other empty property and charges are due from the estate

6150252 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

6150320 presently the outbreak of scabies is limited to one confirmed case
6150321 there are suspected cases because it is a long term facility with close contact its always the case that people with weaker immune systems are at risk
6150322 this is a contagious skin condition which is only transmitted through direct prolonged skin to skin contact

6150324 norwegian scabies is always a concern in long term facilities
6150325 its fairly difficult to diagnose and so far weve only diagnosed typical scabies
6150326 if misdiagnosis or mistreated it can turn into norwegian scabies
6150327 its the same mite but the difference is really the amount of mites but with norwegian scabies theyre on the skin for so long that the host gets really tough heavy scabs which makes it more difficult for the medicinal cream to be effective
6150328 you have to get it from another infected person and it usually occurs with people who are in close quarters everyone is susceptible to an infection

6150356 when you dont have a lot of money for student recruitment you have to be creative the cost to operate the social networking site is affordable and students and prospective students get to talk to each other in real time about the school and about what to expect during their academic careers

6150361 two unlikely allies met for breakfast last month in new york to discuss a possible collaboration mia farrow actress and passionate activist for darfur refugees and erik prince founder and ceo of the government contractor blackwater worldwide
6150362 farrow told abc news that blackwater despite its controversial history and allegations of murdering civilians in iraq might be able to help the hopelessly under equipped african union forces deployed in darfur with logistics and training
6150363 blackwater has a much better idea of what an effective peace keeping mission would look like than western governments farrow told abc news from a refugee camp in near the darfur border farrow said those governments have been unsuccessful in standing up to the sudanese government and bringing peace to the region

6150380 what the mortality rate does is give you an entree to talk to your doctor and say look is this hospital stay going to kill me
6150381 the problem with the cms data is that most hospitals look average which isnt what employers want what they want is to compare hospitals
6150382 when your numbers arent what you like them to be its not because you didnt have the same patients as the hospital across the street
6150383 its because you didnt do as well as you could with the hand you were dealt
6150384 this is turning the lights on for providers of care as well
6150385 doctors and hospitals cant decide to do better unless they know how theyre doing
6150386 if we fall back a bit or if were not making progress
6150387 they want to know what were going to do about it
6150388 theres no one thing that determines whether you save a life
6150389 we learned that if we lock down our elevators when we know a patients coming we can save three or four minutes
6150390 this was a signal that we have to be responsible for patients after theyve left our halls
6150391 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6150392 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6150393 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6150394 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6150395 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6150396 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6150397 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
6150398 as of 8 a m yesterday the total inmate housing revenue for the year was 1 354 153
6150399 i think yesterday morning was the first time we had to turn away some business because we didnt have the room
6150400 with wyandotte county we agreed to eight to 15 inmates at a rate of 35 a day
6150401 these would be inmates waiting to go to the hill
6150402 i think thats a heck of a selling point you have out there
6150403 you have to go through the rdu unit before you go into a state correctional facility
6150404 this will be the first time in two years it looks like were going to hit the revenue projects
6150405 we are exactly right where we need to be at revenue right now if we continue this trend we will hit a little above
6150406 they get in there and they go oh no im not doing this and theyre out of there
6150407 as we continue to stay full and as we work with these counties that are using us kind of as a way station to go to the next level we may want to adjust our fee
6150408 as you know were fixing to switch medical providers out at the jail
6150409 we had two bidders on this one being hp health professionals limited and the second being advanced correctional healthcare inc
6150410 last week we went over the proposals to decide what we really needed or what we were strongly looking at
6150411 one of the things that i saw was that although hp would provide a physician on site four hours a week ach would commit a physician to our clinic for a minimum of two hours a week or until his work was completed whichever was greater
6150412 i dont know how successful wed be at finding a records clerk for 20 hours a week
6150413 the on call is 24 hours but the problem with dr kuhns is him being out there
6150414 hp limited says they will do it for 337 000 ach came in at 374 827 hp limits outside medical care more than ach if we dont reach achs limit we will get 90 percent of the money back we do use a lot of outside services because your x rays and dental are two of the big areas now
6150415 with the ach proposal if you run the numbers the cost difference is only 15 000 higher and we still have the chance to get some money back if we dont use it on the outside
6150416 i think if youre in jail your quality care should not be comparable to what you get if you walk in over at via christi
6150417 i think the quality were talking about here is to avoid a lawsuit
6150418 we have as board members an intense interest in our marketing efforts
6150419 the whole brand identity and visual language theyre all efforts to get more awareness
6150420 why would we want to do something exactly like everyone else and how can we be relevant
6150421 we want to move forward and show people what pure learning power is all about
6150422 we wanted to find people who are unique and thats not hard to do here at butler we try to highlight that
6150423 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
6150424 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
6150425 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
6150426 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
6150427 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
6150428 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
6150429 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
6150430 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
6150431 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
6150432 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked

6150449 the trillion dollar meltdown easy money high rollers and the great credit crash
6150450 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6150451 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6150452 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6150453 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6150454 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6150455 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 percent of the citys need for electricity
6150456 want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful off shore winds miles out in the where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6150457 there would have to be further testing to confirm whether it is indeed a positive case or whether that initial test might have been a false positive that is apparently possible
6150458 and then we also want to determine if possible whether this is a current case of west nile virus or whether that individual was actually previously infected say in another summer and now carries the antibodies
6150459 however that doesnt mean people shouldnt take precautions it just might mean we havent trapped mosquitoes yet and theyre flying around in other areas
6150460 so we do encourage albertans to use repellant containing deet and take other precautions while theyre outside
6150461 i would like to be very clear that there is nothing that we have been able to determine that would deter would be mothers from accessing health care as they have always accessed health care with the utmost confidence
6150462 its not at all clear where they would have picked it up

6150464 it was a 40 ml bottle i was told later it was some lads weekend supply
6150465 i shudder to think what would have happened if alicia had taken any she could have died i contacted the pharmacy to tell them what happened and they demanded the methadone back
6150466 i intended to take it straight to a lawyer but they insisted on having it back and the criminal investigation unit was sent to my home to collect it
6150467 in the worst case scenario she could have been seriously ill and her breathing may have stopped
6150468 giving a child a dose of methadone intended for a drug addict is very bad news
6150469 we take patient safety very seriously and have robust operating procedures in place to minimize the likelihood of this type of incident
6150470 when you roll your eyes at me at your sister etc it is rude and makes me her us feel bad you would not like me her us to behave this way with you and respect has to go both ways if you need some time to yourself please take it and then come and be with us again because we love your company
6150471 dying your hair purple may create some problems for you at school lets talk about what those might be and then you can make a decision
6150472 we believe it is important to take these broader preventative actions to respond to this situation promptly comprehensively and in the best interests of our consumers
6150473 we have a strong culture of food safety that these incidents do not uphold and we are taking every step required to maintain our very high standards
6150474 a blueprint and timeline for transformational change in canadian health care to bring about patient focused care
6150475 the vast majority of doctors across canada dont own a chain of private clinics
6150476 we work in the public system we work with patients some of whom can and most of whom cant afford to pay for their own health care
6150477 the private public rhetoric is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda
6150478 those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check

6150503 there have been some scholarships from private funding that students have gotten thanks to the generosity of some donors
6150504 that solved the problem for a year but not in the long run
6150505 we have had a lot of phone calls from parents and students who now are seeing their chances are becoming more limited
6150506 it seems they feel bad that by coming to the u s and trying to give their children a better life they now face this obstacle
6150507 i need to see if theres a place for me here and im afraid i wont get used to being here
6150508 besides i was afraid at college because i saw the migra immigration law enforcers there twice
6150509 this is not only about being humanitarian or doing a charity it is about investing in something healthy for our community future
6150510 they will be second class citizens and that is contradictory
6150511 they are people who grew up here they are an important part of their communities

6150523 weve finished our journey for the olympic games its a shame we were going to break the record for china at the olympics to take seventh or sixth place but we didnt make it

6150526 information on the number of people involved is not yet available but spanair is doing everything possible to help the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6150527 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6150528 i have a great feeling its a dream come true
6150529 im shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6150530 i was worried but i told myself to leave everything on the track
6150531 i had come here to do it and im so happy with myself
6150532 i worked so hard to become the champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6150533 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime

6150544 weve learned that nvidia is working hard to launch gt200 55nm but this will most certainly wont happen in august or september our sources imply that this will take place in q4 2008 nvidia simply wants to win the performance crown back from r700 adding gddr5 memory and 55nm process will certainly speed things up and they will take the dissipation down thermal dissipation is nvidias biggest problem as the chip turns to be extremely hot and the new 55nm should be a bit better once you take care of thermals you can clock the chip higher which eventually means more performance the 55nm process with a new clock and gddr5 memory should get gt200 55nm a bit faster than r700 and this is exactly what nvidia needs

6150556 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
6150557 it is a fair expectation that somebody is going to apply for leave to appeal
6150558 its an issue of national importance which is the primary ground the supreme court of canada looks to and they also look to the issue of whether theres a conflict at the appellate level which we clearly have in this case
6150559 all were doing is getting ready as soon as we reasonably can to close this transaction we dont know whether there will be an appeal or not if there is an appeal we will deal with it
6150560 on the other hand we have a lot of clients that need their money so well do the best we can to move this forward as fast as possible
6150561 people who sold the paper to the potential appellants to do whatever they can to arrive at a reasonable settlement with them
6150562 the reality is that some of them the upset investors are damn lucky they didnt win the appeal here because they begin to realize theyd be a hell of a lot better off with the restructured paper
6150563 in a very very small minority of cases in which its asked for in this case you have two decisions of the ontario court approving the plan and a very strong decision from the court of appeal today
6150564 i was extremely relieved to hear that the ontario court of appeal not only dismissed the appeal but did so in a unanimous way
6150565 i think were done here and should be moving forward
6150566 lets just drive on and dont hold us hostage any more

6150571 throughout his campaign ashwin madia has spoken against taking money from corporate pacs and has said his campaign would not take any money however campaign finance reports show his campaign received over 10 000 in corporate and business pac contributions dating back to march 2008 and he continued to say he wouldnt take these contributions even after he had begun accepting them madias say one thing do another approach to his own campaign finances shows he cannot be trusted
6150572 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs
6150573 what i havent been taking money from is corporate pacs and the reason i havent is because i think right now that corporations exercise too much influence in washington d c whether its the energy companies insurance companies or the pharmaceutical companies and i think its undeniable that they have effected policy by paying by funding campaigns of both parties and so im proud of the fact that im not taking money from them
6150574 madia has called for removing corporate tax breaks for oil companies something paulsen did not address in his presentation rosenberg said madia will not accept any corporate pac money from the energy industry or any other corporate political action committee

6150580 awakening is just relaxing falling back to your true nature
6150581 the human mind wants to find something wrong and fix it
6150582 god may work in mysterious ways but a simple computer program may explain how religion evolved by distilling religious belief into a genetic predisposition to pass along unverifiable information the program predicts that religion will flourish however religion only takes hold if non believers help believers out perhaps because they are impressed by their devotion
6150583 when people speak their personal story of awakening its not always going to resonate with everyone
6150584 it was a way we could show the spirit of what we are doing at notre dame because the expansion is all about ways we can support the education of young women its about the girls not so much about the field

6150586 our staff has put a lot of effort into building our 2008 roster
6150587 we have brought in players who can fill our deficiencies from last fall and help take ball state volleyball back to the top of the mac i think our fans are going to be pleasantly surprised by the team we have on the floor this season
6150588 our returning players have done a fantastic job of laying the foundation for the new direction of the program the incoming class is a combination of talented freshmen and experienced transfers that should blend in well with our veteran players
6150589 all six of our returning players did an excellent job of buying into what we are trying to accomplish within the program
6150590 i look for them to embrace the newcomers and help them adjust to the expectations i will place on them individually and as a team
6150591 with all the new players joining the program there will be a competition for every starting position this fall this competition will help take our returning players to a new level and bring a new competitiveness to our practice gym
6150592 alisha will be one of the best athletes in the mac
6150593 she is very physical and has the ability to play both middle blocker and outside hitter alisha will be a difference maker for us this fall rachelle is a complete player with all around solid skills if healthy rachelle can hit the ball as hard as anyone in the league and will add a whole new dimension to our offense charde is an extremely gifted athlete who will steadily improve throughout the season her continued evolution as a player will be a significant part of our improvement during the fall hannah is an experienced all around player who will raise our volleyball iq and competitiveness as a team
6150594 brittany brings a wealth of setting knowledge and experience to the program
6150595 she knows what it takes to compete with the best players in the country and i look for her to excel here at ball state andrea is a very offensive minded setter whose left handed play ads a different look to our offense
6150596 jen is an elite athlete who came to ball state to take her game to the next level she is a fast twitch athlete who gets off the ground easily emily goes all out on every play and is someone i am really looking forward to having in the gym emily has the ability to inspire her teammates with her love for the game and for ball state kaylee possesses elite ball control skills her elite quickness is going to allow her make plays many athletes cannot christie is a fantastic volleyball player who has been trained by one of the best high school coaches in the history of our sport in steve shondell she knows what it takes to be successful and win championships
6150597 there are a lot of challenging matches on our schedule
6150598 our early matches will give us a good indication of where we stand as a team entering conference play our goal is to have our team competing as a complete unit as we enter the mac season
6150599 we have dialed our customers into another overstocked inventory to allow them to make their best deal
6150600 our site provides overstock com customers with information from real estate auctioneers and brokers who have direct access to auction properties and local expertise
6150601 it was very important to us in launching the new area of online auction that we had the expertise of an innovative and technically capable real estate auction company williams amp williams is that company
6150602 they share our vision to provide consumers with new empowered ways to shop for property
6150603 were excited to be able to offer another wide reaching opportunity for consumers to tap into real estate offerings
6150604 joining with overstock com to create a milestone in real estate auctions is aligned with our mission and history to deliver real estate to the marketplace with transparency efficiency and convenience
6150605 its hard to see where consumers can turn next home prices seem highly unlikely to start rising again soon stocks you never know but the great bull market looks like a once in a lifetime event homes and stocks are households biggest asset classes by far there isnt much else to borrow against it may be that the standard of living bubble finally has to deflate the result may feel like deprivation but i dont see it that way who knows we might even find that living within our means and saving a little money actually isnt so bad

6150612 its all about challenges and obviously we welcome all comers argentina is the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6150613 we had to play really well in order to win
6150614 they caused us a lot of problems and im glad my duke team doesnt play st
6150615 i think myself and melo and the rest of our shooters michael redd were starting to get a good rhythm for our shots
6150616 and it couldnt come at a better time being that its do or die its go time this is what we came here for and were all ready to go moneys on the line
6150617 i could make it to the basket but he the australian defender kept backing up that was my first thought if he came up and challenged me he was a big man then i was going to try and get to the basket but he kept backing up and i just rose up for the three
6150618 kobe had a great performance and he came up when we needed it the most right at the start of the second half
6150619 it was such a possession by possession game we were lucky that deron hit that shot right at the end of the first half
6150620 weve taken one baby step and now our next step is going to be tough when we play argentina we will have our hands full well have to make sure that our defense is tight and remember that we are here for one thing and that is to win a gold medal
6150621 because leaving this task to the democratic forces to choose one was too risky for the country
6150622 in each case the children fell through the access cover of the rainwater tank and drowned within minutes
6150623 young children are insatiably curious and enjoy exploring their environment their lack of appreciation of any danger compounded by their inability to swim and their failure to call out for help can be a recipe for disaster
6150624 as rainwater tanks are now becoming more common in australia the risk of accidents involving children will inevitably increase it is crucial that we highlight the potential dangers for young children and ensure the tanks are properly secured
6150625 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect

6150630 some appeared to have turned to violent extremist groups in the misguided belief that participation in jihad might help atone for previous wrongdoing
6150631 we have noticed that terrorist groups are remarkably tolerant of individuals with serious criminal histories this is the case even when those individuals continue to be involved in very serious non terrorist crimes including drug trafficking assault and even rape
6150632 this feeling is heightened by mainstream uk media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes of muslims by islamic and non islamic media that reports atrocities against muslims worldwide and by the extremist groups themselves who spread the message that muslims are being persecuted to the point that the only course of action is to fight back with violence
6150633 what is different about those who ended up involved in terrorism is that they came into contact with existing extremists who recognised their vulnerabilities and their usefulness to the extremist group
6150634 people do not generally become radicalised simply through passive browsing of extremist websites but many such sites create opportunities for the virtual social interaction that drives radicalisation in the virtual world books dvds pamphlets and music all feature in the experiences of british terrorists but their emotional content eg images of atrocities against muslims is often more important than their factual content
6150635 membership of a terrorist group can provide a sense of meaning and purpose it can lead to enhanced self esteem and the individual can feel a sense of control and influence over their lives some may find psychological security in a belief in future rewards both in paradise and in the collective memory of the movement following suicide operations
6150636 although it is popular to assume that people who become terrorists are passively brainwashed into extremism individuals in fact make active choices to become and remain in extremist activity
6150637 sections of the media our own and allies governments can sometimes make statements that are unwittingly or deliberately provocative non muslim groups eg rightwing extremists can also stoke false fears and resentments which can heighten the perception of threat in muslim communities
6150638 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6150639 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6150640 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6150641 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6150642 end of september were hoping to start a new record
6150643 i cant really talk about it at the moment but as far as were concerned its booked and we re going in to start recording properly around then
6150644 i think its more rocknroll than punk and there are sing alongs galore on there ive got a feeling its gonna surprise a lot of people
6150645 the old guys have been replaced by younger more enthusiastic and better looking serious musicians
6150646 we all went to school together which is nice now were gonna go round the world together hopefully we can keep it together this time round
6150647 we have what a lot of people are looking for at wide receiver we have depth and speed so that makes your running game better because they cant load the box
6150648 i think we have a veteran line that really helps we have inexperienced tailbacks but i think theyre talented
6150649 weve got to get a guy that doesnt have to carry the team he just has to manage the game make smart decisions and put his teammates in position to be successful
6150650 he just has to realize we have enough talent around him and all he has to do is distribute the ball and take what the defense gives him
6150651 for me its just been taking small steps i played as a true freshman didnt play my sophomore year and then played last year as a junior
6150652 having a good receiving corps makes this whole offense change
6150653 when i got here we had six or seven guys in the receiving room now were packed we have to bring extra chairs in there it gives this offense a lot of speed on the field at once you can dump it off you can throw it deep you can do a lot of different things
6150654 im really anticipating our defense playing pretty good this year
6150655 last year i was running around at 100 mph really trying to do three different jobs
6150656 now i realize how much i appreciate having him back my life almost has some sanity to it
6150657 when we started meeting as an offense coach was in those meetings and he made the comment he felt comfortable in how the offense was being run and he had some other things to do and felt he could leave and then i was talking to friedgens wife gloria one time and she mentioned to me that hes happier and healthier than hes been in years
6150658 because security best practices cannot be adequately documented or enforced when machines are transported and stored in poll workers homes work places or automobiles and because this places undue responsibility on poll workers changes were needed
6150659 complex and sensitive voting equipment could be adversely affected by extreme temperatures and humidity water damage dust and unauthorized use
6150660 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
6150661 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6150662 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and economic progress over the last three decades but much more remains to be done
6150663 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests
6150664 we cannot accept this kind of blindness not accepting international law

6150671 in spite of the increasing variety of ways to get the news the proportion of young people getting no news on a typical day has increased substantially over the past decade about a third of those younger than 25 34 percent say they get no news on a typical day up from 25 percent in 1998
6150672 across all web news consumers 83 percent say they use search engines to find stories of interest about the same as in 2006 but a growing percentage is using search engines more frequently nearly a third of online news users 31 deploy search engines to look for news stories at least three days a week up from 24 percent two years ago and 19 percent in 2004
6150673 a slim majority of americans now say they check in on the news from time to time during the day rather than get the news at regular times this marks the first time since the question was first asked in 2002 that most americans consider themselves news grazers
6150674 overall 73 percent of all online users say they come across news online when they have been on the web for another purpose this is largely unchanged from 2006 76 but a decade ago far fewer people inadvertently got news online 54 percent in 1998

6150729 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6150730 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6150731 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6150732 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6150733 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

6150736 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6150737 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6150738 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking

6150744 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6150745 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

6150784 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6150786 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
6150787 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
6150788 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

6150790 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
6150791 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

6150849 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6150850 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them

6150857 these sites provide a record for the future about the workings of the government in this day and time
6150858 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
6150859 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents
6150860 the majority of information is actually made available through these web sites but they are changing very rapidly as new information is introduced and especially as administration changes occur
6150861 when bush took over the second that he was sworn in the white house web site went from being this massive collection of important links to a picture of bush and his biography and a picture of vice president cheney and his biography
6150862 we dont want to see that happen again its just very important for historys sake that this material is archived the way that the printed material has always been archived
6150863 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
6150864 health care costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
6150865 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
6150866 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
6150867 this isnt the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs

6150871 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots

6150894 some of the people sentenced only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
6150895 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
6150896 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance with international law and the sudanese constitution which guarantees fair trials
6150897 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately
6150898 but theyre trying to encourage sellers to do more because thats where the growth is

6150901 they like ebay circa 2006 and this move will encourage displeasure from traditional sellers

6150955 the liver transplantation program at montefiore medical center fills a significant unmet medical need for people who live in the bronx and suffer from end stage liver disease
6150956 the bronx has one of the highest rates of liver disease in the country and the highest rate of liver disease in new york state
6150957 until now patients in the bronx and surrounding areas who had liver disease had to travel outside of the borough to receive care which was an additional burden on them and their families
6150958 our liver transplant program now allows these patients to receive be cared for locally closer to home by a team of professionals at a center with an incredible amount of experience and expertise in all aspects of liver care
6150959 we have a world class team of surgeons and liver specialists with a wide range of experience in treating and researching severe liver disease
6150960 more than 120 bronx patients were waiting for liver transplants in 2007 and approximately 50 local residents had no choice but to seek a liver transplant outside the borough last year
6150961 we have found there is a greater rate of alcohol use intravenous drug use and confounding variables like malnutrition and diminished access to health care here in the bronx
6150962 the number of hospitalizations for liver related diagnoses in bronx area hospitals has increased substantially magnifying the importance of having an easily accessible local liver transplant center in the bronx

6150968 el misterioso avi n del 11 s y la desaparici n de ee uu
6150969 eliminar a al qaeda de la faz de la tierra
6150970 el armamento de la alianza del norte para pasar a la ofensiva contra los talibanes y que se presionara a la cia para que persiguiera a bin laden y a la dirigencia de al qaeda
6150971 antes de que la nieve comience a caer en afganist n a m s tarde a mediados de octubre
6150972 existen cuarenta y dos importantes objetivos talibanes a ser bombardeados
6150973 el pent gono hab a estado estudiando posibles objetivos en la misma primavera es decir 1998 en la que la cia hab a estado preparando su plan secreto para atacar tarnack farm
6150974 conduce a una persona as como a una organizaci n terrorista global
6150975 tenemos excelente evidencia de v nculos entre osama bin laden agentes de al qaeda y lo que sucedi el 11 de septiembre
6150976 hab a que presentar pruebas de que el ataque terrorista del 11 de septiembre provino del exterior sin embargo esa prueba todav a no ha sido suministrada
6150977 he visto evidencia absolutamente poderosa e incontrovertible de su v nculo de osama bin laden con los eventos del 11 de septiembre
6150978 no existe evidencia presentada en el expediente que vincule directamente a bin laden con el 11 de septiembre
6150979 no exist a duda alguna de la responsabilidad de bin laden por los ataques del 11 de septiembre antes de que se descubriera la cinta
6150980 obviamente este hombre es decir bin laden es la personificaci n del mal parece deleitado por haber matado a m s gente de lo que esperaba lo que hace que uno se pregunte lo abstrusos que son realmente sus malvados coraz n y alma
6150981 en los sitios m s importantes en los que se supone que el v deo prueba la culpa de bin laden la traducci n no es id ntica con el rabe
6150982 los traductores estadounidenses que escucharon las cintas y las transcribieron aparentemente escribieron muchas cosas que quer an o r pero que no se pod an escuchar en la cinta no importa cu ntas veces uno la escuchaba
6150983 el motivo por el que no se menciona el 11 s en la p gina del m s buscado de osama bin laden es porque el fbi no posee evidencia concreta que conecte a bin laden con el 11 s
6150984 bin laden no ha sido formalmente acusado en conexi n con el 11 s
6150985 el fbi re ne evidencia una vez que ha reunido la evidencia la entrega al departamento de justicia el departamento de justicia decide si tiene suficiente evidencia para presentarla a un jurado de acusaci n federal en el caso de los atentados contra las embajadas de ee uu en 1998 bin laden fue formalmente culpado y acusado por un jurado de acusaci n no ha sido formalmente culpado y acusado en conexi n con el 11 s porque el fbi no posee evidencia concreta que conecte a bin laden con el 11 s
6150986 no hemos tenido muchas noticias suyas es decir de bin laden y no dir a necesariamente que est al centro de alguna estructura de comando y de nuevo no s donde est yo repito lo que dije verdaderamente no me preocupa tanto su persona

6151055 we are very excited to be joining forces with such an environmentally conscious county such as harvey county
6151056 we believe that the amount of waste that ends up having to be dumped in a landfill will be reduced by 85 to 90 the county its administration and its commissioners are very pro active in searching out green alternatives the fact that they were willing to lease over 32 acres of their land their existing transfer station and over 10 pieces of waste processing and hauling equipment for only a dollar per year shows their commitment to making their dream of not burying trash a reality we hope that the 5 of net profits from the sale of products made by biogold will be used by harvey county to improve what is already a wonderful county
6151057 the playstation 4 and xbox 720 will arrive in 2011 or 2012 we think

6151059 the beijing games are the only opportunity we have to see a summer olympics in action before it is our turn to host
6151060 several british government ministers have been in china to learn from your experience london 2012 will of course be very different from beijing 2008
6151061 but we will certainly be drawing very positive lessons from chinas ability to offer top class facilities to competitors and to cope with the pressure on its infrastructure caused by the many thousands of extra visitors to beijing for the games
6151062 there will be a detailed exchange between the two organizing committees to capture lessons learned and i was delighted to announce during my visit to china in january a major program of sporting exchanges tomorrows champions so we can learn from each others expertise across a range of olympic disciplines
6151063 the facilities provided for the competitors are exemplary not just in beijing but elsewhere in mainland china and hong kong
6151064 when i visited the birds nest stadium in january it was already a stunning building i am looking forward greatly to sitting in this fantastic venue during the games themselves
6151065 this is i think the most important message of the olympics that the world can be brought together through sport and it is what i will be going to beijing to celebrate
6151066 both our countries have invested heavily in our sport and both have a passion for the olympic games

6151094 yes the election is fair i had the poll workers take the ballot boxes home at night to guard them
6151095 but their critics call that nonsense and argue that allowing people to take voting machines home with them where they can access them at any time and potentially hack into them is the very definition of a security risk

6151114 liam has had limited opportunities here so i just felt for his confidence he should go and play some games and hopefully score some goals
6151115 i think he has struggled a bit with confidence since he has been here he has not really hit the ground running hes been a little bit overawed by the size of the club what he needs is some games and goals to give him the confidence that he can get in our team
6151116 ive said to him that going out on loan is not a slap in the face and told him to go there and get some goals get some games under his belt and come back and try to get in the team
6151117 it is not the end of liam dickinson but i just felt it would benefit the lad and also us that he goes and plays some matches
6151118 nacer is an exciting prospect and is going to be a good player
6151119 hes young and inexperienced but he will join our first team squad whether he is ready to go week in week out in the championship i dont know but if we can have him for a long time and he becomes a player great
6151120 he stood out a touch of class and is a very good footballer
6151121 i think thats important and i spoke to arsenal on a few occasions over the summer about players
6151122 its a great link up with arsenal and a relationship i have been keen to do because they have got some really good young players
6151123 teams like birmingham city in the past have really benefited from having that relationship and the beauty of nacer being here is that arsene wenger knows he is at a proper football club
6151124 he knows he is going to get well looked after and knows the facilities are top class so there is no worry about him not getting looked after
6151125 he is a midfield player has captained st etienne and we are having as look at him for a week we are always trying to improve the squad
6151126 alan picked up the injury against arsenal at the back end of last season had an operation in the summer and we thought that would clear it up but he suffered a recurrence against doncaster
6151127 when we have looked at the time he would need to go back in for an operation and the recuperation time alan has come to the decision that it is an appropriate time to hang his boots up it is a great shame but he has handled it in his usual very professional manner it is probably in the best interests of the club and the player that he concentrates on the next stage of his career which i am sure will be involved in football in some capacity
6151128 paul jewell wanted an organiser and someone who can play a bit as well and it is just unfortunate it has not worked out but rather than drag it out and cost the club unnecessary money alan has the attiude of lets all get on with our lives and move on he has had some career and im sure this news is water off a ducks back to alan when you have recovered from cancer twice as he has it puts everything into perspective he has had a tremendous career he has been a very very good top level player he is well thought of here and we wish him all the best for the future
6151129 we are looking at it ideally what paul would like to do is still move another three players out and then possibly bring one or two in it is a very diffcult market at the minute to move players on we have certainly got two or three players who we think it is in the best interests to move on but thats easier said than done

6151158 his sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them when a period of feasting had run its course job would send and have them purified early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them thinking perhaps my children have sinned and cursed god in their hearts this was jobs regular custom

6151160 have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him

6151173 i dont think you need to be afraid of life our hearts are very frail and there are places where the road is very steep and very lonely but we have a wonderful god

6151260 if you put the sand into the jar first there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks the same goes for your life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that really matter pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take time to get medical checkups take your partner out dancing there will always be time to go to work clean the house give a dinner party and fix the disposal
6151261 take care of the rocks first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand

6151264 if god wants me to be healed hell just heal me and thats it
6151265 success is not measured by what you accomplish but by the opposition you have encountered and the courage with which you have maintained the struggle against overwhelming odds
6151266 we are delighted with the response weve received from physicians across the state in support of cracking down on people who try to doctor shop

6151269 when you act as midwives to the hebrew women and see them on the birthstool if it is a boy kill him but if it is a girl she shall live
6151270 why have you done this and allowed the boys to live
6151271 because the hebrew women are not like the egyptian women for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them

6151274 si avanzamos en la sudamericana no tendremos m s remedio que elegir una de las dos competiciones
6151275 el torneo apertura argentino es importante pero en la sudamericana est n los equipos m s importantes del continente y no hay que despreciarla
6151276 hay que tratar de marcar un gol para que ellos est n obligados a anotar dos
6151277 estoy segura de que esta vez el resultado ser diferente
6151278 espero que esta vez culmine todo con el oro en mi cuello
6151279 son un gran conjunto que viene de perder a una de sus jugadoras m s importantes como es abby wambach

6151286 las chances de ganarles son del 5 10 por ciento pero est n ah
6151287 todos saben lo dif cil que es para nosotros estar entre los cuatro primeros
6151288 mantuvimos la cabeza fr a para sacar el partido adelante
6151289 el que gana no es siempre el que maneja el tiempo del partido
6151290 cuando llegas a cuartos de final juegas contra los mejores equipos del mundo y la diferencia es m nima
6151291 hoy hay que llorar pero ma ana levantar la cabeza para llevar bronce
6151292 hoy hay que llorar pero ma ana levantar la cabeza para llevar el bronce
6151293 hoy tomamos el d a como lo que es es duro dif cil hay que llorar y ma ana enfrentar lo que viene levantar la cabeza para llevar la medalla de bronce que es una medalla y hay que darle la misma importancia que si fuera de oro
6151294 es duro las m s chicas tendr n su revancha en londres y all estar alentandolas se hizo lo que se pudo pero holanda hoy est mejor quer amos estar en las finales cre a que argentina pod a pero de coraz n ellas jugaron mejor nos marcaron mucha diferencia tanto en el juego como en los c rner cortos y creo que lo tienen bien ganado y merecido
6151295 nunca le encontramos la vuelta jugamos de contragolpe que pens bamos que era el arma m s fuerte que ten amos pero tampoco funcionaba y se hizo lo que se pudo aunque la realidad es que ellas fueron mejores y se merecen estar en la final
6151296 dur simo ellas hicieron muy buen torneo hoy han jugado muy bien a china y contra nosotras van a salir a cien por cien no debemos salir confiadas por m s que les gan ramos por mucha diferencia de goles tenemos que entrar de la misma manera que entramos en cada partido dar lo mejor y jugar cada pelota como si fuera la ltima esa es la f rmula
6151297 no me gustar a salir cuarta me gustar a llevarme una medalla a argentina china y holanda son los dos que se merecen estar en la final por su rendimiento en el torneo pero nosotras podemos perfectamente si nos ponemos las pilas
6151298 saldremos a ganar la final porque por algo somos argentinos
6151299 la final hay que salir a ganarla por algo somos argentinos
6151300 tiene jugadores muy fuertes un estilo a costa de marfil
6151301 corren durante los noventa minutos pero adem s tienen buen pie
6151302 nos quisieron jugar a la contra pero no nos sorprendieron todo nos sali redondo
6151303 estoy muy contento por c mo nos va ahora nos encontramos bastante tranquilos sabiendo que s lo nos queda la ltima final porque aqu todas han sido aut nticas finales
6151304 la sustancia encontrada no es una droga para mejorar el rendimiento ni es una droga para ocultar otras sustancias pero de todas formas est prohibida
6151305 recibo con orgullo esta bandera y espero poder honrarla trayendo una medalla de vuelta
6151306 estos son atletas de alto rendimiento que han tenido que clasificar en sus respectivos deportes y espec ficamente estos tres hicieron la marca a para estar en beijing
6151307 la nica forma de trascender en el deporte es participando exponi ndonos no tengo duda de que estos atletas nos representar n dignamente
6151308 estamos listos para el duelo con cuba y esta vez esperamos que las cosas caigan de nuestro lado
6151309 no hay nada en contra del equipo cubano simplemente queremos la victoria deportiva como ellos tambi n lucharan por lograrlo
6151310 de lo que no hay ninguna duda es que el viernes se dar un buen partido porque ambos equipos nos conocemos y no tenemos secretos
6151311 ahora entiendo por qu la selecci n de per no va a un mundial teniendo los jugadores que tiene
6151312 esto parece que es com n ac algo natural y no hay forma de cambiarlo estoy sorprendido con todo esto hasta ahora no s qu significa la palabra profesionalismo en per y creo que no existe a m me hab an dicho muchas cosas pero ahora lo estoy viviendo en carne propia
6151313 me he quedado sin palabras por la falta de profesionalismo que hay en el per
6151314 si me preguntan si estoy arrepentido de haber venido a dirigir al f tbol peruano por todos los problemas que he tenido que enfrentar en tan poco tiempo pues s lo dir a que estoy sorprendido
6151315 figure out a way to get them 12 000 15 000 troops there
6151316 el equipo uruguayo en un mal partido y en un campo que se pareci a una playa por la cantidad de arena logr el objetivo de la victoria pero su rendimiento y el gol del elenco paraguayo generan dudas para la revancha
6151317 todos salieron del estadio formul ndose la misma pregunta ser suficiente la victoria por 2 1
6151318 el primer objetivo se cumpli la victoria qued en casa pero la interrogante es cuanto pesar el gol de libertad para la revancha
6151319 el campe n uruguayo se impuso ante el libertad pero dej abierto un gran signo de interrogaci n
6151320 debido a su gol al equipo paraguayo le bastar ganar por 1 0 en la revancha para quedarse con la clasificaci n
6151321 sud la gota gorda o tina violeta por el color de su camiseta y gan pero no pudo cerrar la llave que qued abierta para la revancha de la semana que viene
6151322 la victoria permitir ir con m s tranquilidad a asunci n para definir la clasificaci n a la siguiente fase
6151323 el hockey merece una medalla y las medallas son hist ricas
6151324 hay que dejar pasar este momento ten amos mucha ilusi n pero hay que pelear por la medalla las medallas son hist ricas no importa a veces del color que sean el hockey merece una medalla y ser a la tercera vez que la logra consecutivamente as que vamos a ir por ella a morir
6151325 muy cerrado que no dej jugar y tuvo tranquilidad para jugar mejor la pelota
6151326 la diferencia es en los c rner ellas lo tienen temible nosotros no lo defendimos bien y ellas a nosotras s en el segundo tiempo tuvimos que salir a jugar 3 3 1 3 para hacer el partido m s desordenado y buscar alg n gol en los primeros cinco o diez minutos no se pudo dar holanda es un gran equipo y manej muy bien la pelota
6151327 una de las ideas era salir m s de frente pero sabemos que esta tiradora puede tirar a cualquier lado le ha hecho goles a todos es muy dif cil a veces contrarrestarlo ya es casi un c rner de varones
6151328 todos los partidos son diferentes ellas van a salir tambi n de otra forma hoy alemania jug muy bien contra china pero son partidos diferentes nosotros podemos llegar a presionar que es lo que menos le gusta a alemania a los dos les duele estar fuera de la final nosotros est bamos muy ilusionados
6151329 sobis no sale del betis porque yo no quiero que salga aunque venga un delantero este a o no sale del betis
6151330 completamente nuevo para todos lo que dificulta saber c mo se adaptar n tanto equipos como pilotos
6151331 lo que est claro por el trabajo de simulaci n que hemos hecho es que es un circuito r pido con fuertes frenadas y tres puntos de adelantamiento muy buenos
6151332 por lo que he hablado con los pilotos de gt que compitieron aqu a finales de julio el asfalto ten a buena adherencia por lo que est por ver si los extra blandos aguantar n
6151333 personalmente no tengo ni que decir lo que me gustar a competir ante nuestra afici n en este segundo gp de casa es tremendamente frustrante acudir a valencia como mero tercer piloto os lo aseguro
6151334 es un momento de dolor toda la expedici n espa ola en pek n est consternada por la noticia desde aqu enviamos nuestro m sentido p same y el mayor apoyo a los heridos y a los familiares de las v ctimas deben saber que aunque estemos a m s de doce mil kil metros el mundo del deporte est con ellos
6151335 the worst is yet to come in the u s
6151336 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
6151337 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players
6151338 were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
6151339 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust
6151340 you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
6151341 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
6151342 if to talk to oneself when alone is folly it must be doubly unwise to listen to oneself in the presence of others
6151343 he did everything right he was a kid we liked and it was very unfortunate
6151344 the way it worked out theres a chance when he gets healthy that we can bring him back later in the season we felt like we dealt with him fairly and he did a fantastic job for us
6151345 i think depth wise were fine but you are always looking to improve the quality of your team
6151346 its day to day and when i get on the field depends on the trainers but i felt pretty good being able to run out here for the first time
6151347 i hope to get a lot of those guys back on monday but whether that comes to reality or not i dont know yet thats up to the medical people
6151348 the key is hes caught passes from a lot of good quarterbacks
6151349 not to take anything away from the timing you have with your own quarterback i would prefer he be out there and so would he but the reality is hasnt been but we saw quite a bit of him in the otas and in camp before the injury were just hoping to get him back out there as soon as possible
6151350 how long they will play in the third quarter will be based on how many reps theyve gotten
6151351 we have an adage that people live up or down to expectations
6151352 weve had high expectations for him hes met those until we get into the regular season and really get any kind of body of work going we wont know but hes been everything we thought he is
6151353 unfortunately below is the cold hard truth about the internet
6151354 gurus are selling their programs and software to you so that they can make their millions without a care in the world
6151355 i want to say thanks for taking the time to talk to me about the sticky mess we are in with our loan i really appreciate your honesty and letting me know there is not anything in your book that will help us in this unique situation
6151356 mr robert blake thank you for publishing the e mail virus explination on your website i received
6151357 i felt a glimmer of hope when i heard this bill had went through we are 2 months behind on our
6151358 very interesting article and interview i agree that the bill is great for white house publicity
6151359 of course im not wasting time on the web im transcribing
6151360 he is too talented to not get on the field and here is a position of need
6151361 meermaals heb ik in de bevoegde commissie vragen gesteld over de manier waarop de personeelspiramide opnieuw in evenwicht kon worden gebracht het gemengd loopbaanconcept dat de paarse regering in gang zette was voor mij een aanzet van oplossing ik ben akkoord met de kritiek dat dit lang uitgesponnen in de tijd is maar men dient hervormingen op een menselijke manier door te voeren
6151362 de uitstroom bij het departement landsverdediging is echter onderhevig aan een paradox terwijl het voor oudere militairen niet goed lukt blijkt de uitstroom veel hoger bij jonge militairen dan in andere departementen
6151363 we go way way back and we may be one of the first if not the first to just be opening
6151364 some of them have transferred back to jefferson high which they could do
6151365 in the front we have columns which celebrate the entrance and theres a dome on top and thats very unusual architecture especially for a school i think its very appropriate with the name washington high school that we do have that great grand entrance
6151366 response rates will be low since other social media such as facebook and myspace have fared poorly selling stuff to their users
6151367 it seems a little like the dance we went through with zimbabwe at the commonwealth where eventually as the commonwealth stuck to its guns mr mugabe left rather than face his peers
6151368 one hopes that fiji sees the sense of sticking to the commitments it gave to leaders and i would think the message coming out of the forum should be that thats what it should be doing
6151369 one of the first british parent coaching operation newton has extensive experience with dealing with young offenders and unlike other unscrupulous operators is properly trained and qualified
6151370 we have captured 689 members of al qaeda and handed over 369 to the united states we have earned those who habitually accuse us of not doing enough in the war on terror should simply ask cia how much prize money it has paid to the government of pakistan
6151371 all have been illegally abducted by secretive intelligence agencies they began disappearing in 2001 during the so called war on terror
6151372 soner 650 is just the tip of a very nasty iceberg of human rights abuses illegal detentions and rendition flights it is a shameful episode in pakistans history which must be put right
6151373 every day he reports from a war zone where he is also a prisoner his homeland gaza is surrounded starved attacked forgotten he is a profoundly humane witness to one of the great injustices the voice of the voiceless

6151378 im sorry i piddled on the meter it was unintentional i was out with friends looking for a good time and i was busting
6151379 i couldnt stand properly i wasnt pissed off with the parking meter i was not aware of what i was doing
6151380 high commissioner john dauth has apologised to miss clark who has accepted the apology
6151381 miss clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and that she had had a bit of a laugh
6151382 she is renowned for her managerial skills the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
6151383 she holds generally leftwing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war
6151384 she does not trust those outside the small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in new zealand known as h2
6151385 i thought it was quite funny but as i say if i was to have my cvs of other leaders fall off the back of trucks youd all have a lot of laughs as well
6151386 ten percent of the health care facilities in our country have anything worth the name of an information technology system
6151387 information technology is so important in providing health care and reducing the cost of health care
6151388 thats why we asked for outside funding saying well go through the hard knocks of going through the first couple of cycles but well be able to teach other people how to do that
6151389 what at first seems like a worthwhile idea with good intentions after consideration starts to look darker
6151390 i was trying to win gold but the main focus was not coming away with nothing
6151391 there was a lot of pumping going down and no time to breathe throughout the race i was just destroyed at the end
6151392 thankfully the guys behind me werent able to catch me i thought they were going to at one stage but i held on
6151393 i was stressing the whole race i was never confident in sailing conditions like today anything could happen
6151394 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that
6151395 all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6151396 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6151397 in the end i decided to let the israeli guy go and concentrate on covering the french and british guys
6151398 obviously a very bright boy as hes computing a lot as he goes along
6151399 i had followed windsurfing through barbara kendall and aaron mcintosh but my plan had been to go laser sailing i guess it was a push into the sport but not in a pushy way i just loved it straight away its a really fantastic sport
6151400 this has gone as well as it could have gone but i dont know if ill be carrying on i do love what i do but id really like to go to university to study law at some stage and my nature is to be all or nothing so if i did that id want to give it 100 per cent
6151401 i wont say ive lived like a monk for the last little while but ive been really focused and i need to think about everything
6151402 he managed to get on to the water they smuggled him on to a press boat which was pretty cool
6151403 you have to be a bit psycho to be the best at this sport and he is i mean psycho in a nice way hes intensely focused
6151404 a lot of things happened through the year that i was not happy with in many ways but i think because of family now ive decided its the right time to put all my energy into my family and recharged my batters and myself too
6151405 how about the way tanguay didnt move at all after the hit
6151406 i meant sell it or stop playing it how do you have so much fun with a game you complain about every single hour on these forums
6151407 do you embrace your feminine side are you embarrassed of your pee pee
6151408 its family thats the only thing thats kept me here

6151411 i normally arrive at the warm up area an hour before that gives me time to have my last quiet time i zone out i lie down on the massage table put my headphones on close my eyes and basically am a zombie for 50 minutes
6151412 weve developed a pattern at the end of my warm up just before i go to the call room where hell pray for me willis said
6151413 thanked god for everything that had built for this moment we just wanted to enjoy it we just offered this race back up to him and then i went off to the call room

6151562 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6151563 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6151564 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6151565 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6151566 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6151567 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6151568 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6151569 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6151570 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6151571 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6151572 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6151573 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6151574 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6151575 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6151576 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6151577 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6151578 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6151579 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6151580 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6151581 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6151582 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms

6151584 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6151585 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6151586 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6151587 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6151588 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend
6151589 i would expect that from someone who is simple minded
6151590 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6151591 oh boy you actually think you got me on that one did i ever imply that she was a creationist in fact i am glad she is not because if she were a creationist then oh boy how simple it would be to dismiss her discovery get it indeed i like the fact that she is not doh the point of the post was despite the evidence scientists will simply dismiss it its not oh well we should look at our dating methods its like we have to reevaluate how fossilization occurs oh we know this is 80 million years old because of the layer huh so after knocking down your straw man how do explain her discovery

6151667 en materia de derechos humanos chile sigue observando graves deficiencias
6151668 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6151669 cuesti n que por lo dem s era de conocimiento de las autoridades sanitarias al momento de prometer la incorporaci n de la analgesia en el parto seg n se desprende de la lectura de la gu a cl nica respectiva
6151670 la promesa del auge de terminar con la discriminaci n contra las mujeres en el sistema de salud privado ha tenido tanta suerte como en el caso del sistema p blico pues el fondo de compensaci n interisapres reconoce la propia autoridad sanitaria demorar a cerca de 6 a os en ajustarse
6151671 el derecho a la libertad de expresi n juega tambi n un rol fundamental en el ejercicio de otros derechos pol ticos tales como el derecho de reuni n y protesta por tanto debe evitarse un acercamiento a las movilizaciones sociales que reduzca tales manifestaciones leg timas a meros actos de violencia y falta de raz n
6151672 un estado que no reconoce adecuadamente el derecho a la huelga de sus trabajadores tiene serias dificultades para honrar su compromiso con la dignidad del trabajo y con la humanizaci n del capital
6151673 sin perjuicio de su contribuci n a los derechos humanos las instituciones existentes son insuficientes e inefectivas para otorgar protecci n a los derechos de las personas los distintos proyectos de ley presentados por el ejecutivo y discutidos en el parlamento en los ltimos 17 a os incluido el del instituto nacional de derechos humanos no satisfacen los est ndares de independencia autonom a y representaci n judicial efectiva necesarios para su debida implementaci n en chile
6151674 algo que contradice el esp ritu y contenido del derecho internacional de los derechos humanos reconocido por el estado de chile y plenamente vigente
6151675 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6151676 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo en fin un informe sobre las violaciones a los derechos de las personas y grupos a nivel nacional pretende decir con toda claridad aquello sobre lo que el estado aprende a callar

6151685 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6151686 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6151687 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his

6151699 we are appalled to learn that the secretary of state has not only overturned the advice of english heritage as her expert advisors but she has also chosen to ignore the learned opinion of an independent inspector english heritage finds it incomprehensible that her reason for doing so was because she considered that community benefits outweigh harm to the historic environment as though one must be at the sacrifice of the other

6151734 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
6151735 that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
6151736 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words

6151766 finding solutions to americas crumbling infrastructure is an issue that senators obama and mccain and members of congress on both sides of the aisle should embrace
6151767 there are 18 billion dollars in infrastructure projects across the nation that are ready to go not roads to nowhere but projects that have been studied at length and validated beyond question we must join together to find solutions to this crisis and creating jobs by funding the 3 000 highway and transportation projects that are ready to begin immediately is a good place to start
6151768 both presidential candidates along with congress must not waste this critical opportunity to put the economy back on track by funding critical infrastructure projects in a stimulus bill one of the most immediate and sustainable ways to shore up our struggling economy
6151769 investments in our countrys roads rails and bridges literally pay for themselves creating a five fold return in benefits to the state and national economy for every billion dollars spent on infrastructure 42 000 jobs are created or sustained and more than 5 70 of economic benefits is generated for every dollar invested

6151785 the liver transplantation program at montefiore medical center fills a significant unmet medical need for people who live in the bronx and suffer from end stage liver disease
6151786 the bronx has one of the highest rates of liver disease in the country and the highest rate of liver disease in new york state
6151787 until now patients in the bronx and surrounding areas who had liver disease had to travel outside of the borough to receive care which was an additional burden on them and their families
6151788 our liver transplant program now allows these patients to receive be cared for locally closer to home by a team of professionals at a center with an incredible amount of experience and expertise in all aspects of liver care
6151789 we have a world class team of surgeons and liver specialists with a wide range of experience in treating and researching severe liver disease
6151790 more than 120 bronx patients were waiting for liver transplants in 2007 and approximately 50 local residents had no choice but to seek a liver transplant outside the borough last year
6151791 we have found there is a greater rate of alcohol use intravenous drug use and confounding variables like malnutrition and diminished access to health care here in the bronx
6151792 the number of hospitalizations for liver related diagnoses in bronx area hospitals has increased substantially magnifying the importance of having an easily accessible local liver transplant center in the bronx

6151854 if the history of the katrina recovery were written today it would be a tragedy far too little progress has been made despite the remarkable effort and ingenuity of the people of the region who are fighting to restore their homes and their lives
6151855 much of the progress has come at the hands of gulf coast residents in spite of significant hurdles placed in front of them by the federal government the next administration must act quickly to remove those hurdles so gulf coast residents can truly and finally recover from the storms
6151856 a new administration will face the challenge of correcting the mistakes of its predecessor and a critical opportunity to rebuild the gulf coast better and stronger
6151857 the time is now to renew our promise and commit to a full gulf coast recovery

6151861 donnie understands first hand how not owning life insurance can leave loved ones financially vulnerable in the event of a tragedy but just as important the peace of mind it provides to those whove purchased it
6151862 the vast majority of americans understand the need for life insurance yet a startling 68 million adult americans have no coverage at all we are hopeful that donnies involvement this september will motivate americans to take a short break from their busy lives to determine if theyre among the millions who lack adequate life insurance protection

6151897 elotuzumab provides us with the opportunity to develop and market an innovative therapy that has the potential to meaningfully address the significant unmet medical need in multiple myeloma
6151898 consistent with our companys strategy to integrate external innovation and to expand our capabilities this collaboration will further strengthen our pipeline of agents targeting hematologic malignancies which includes sprycel r and tanespimycin an hsp90 inhibitor from our recent acquisition of kosan biosciences
6151899 we are delighted to enter this global alliance with bristol myers squibb which we believe will maximize the potential benefit of elotuzumab to patients and highlight the value of our scientific discoveries and antibody technologies to the field
6151900 in addition bristol myers squibb brings extensive oncology development experience and resources and we look forward to collaborating with them to increase the scope of the elotuzumab development program moving forward
6151901 the ministry will be able to track it down if there were files
6151902 we will not take pleasure in chen case instead we and all politicians should learn the lesson from the incident that no one can hide the truth forever
6151903 no matter how embarrassing or despicable the truth is we need to face it with courage people will no longer trust the government if we fail to investigate this case thoroughly and it will shake the nation to its roots
6151904 we will find out which laws or clauses originally listed under the cecs jurisdiction may apply to chens case and whether we can intervene as an independent government institution
6151905 if the cec cannot handle the case we will provide assistance to parties such as the court
6151906 chen may be fined between nt 500 000 and nt 2 5 million
6151907 feng was educated in japan for several years he has a strong foundation in the japanese language and i believe he will establish contacts very fast once he arrives in japan
6151908 japan is one of taiwans most important friends we must not take the position lightly feng has an arduous task ahead of him because he lacks the necessary familiarity with the japanese society cultural and political climate
6151909 in all my experiences there were no problem of export from us to taiwan i bought many ngvs ir lasers and thermal ws there were smooth there problem is importing to us your gov was more afraid of importing things than exporting one

6151934 la soluci n parte de que el gobierno recupere la institucionalidad mediante el tribunal constitucional y la cne el establecimiento de acuerdos productivos de la nueva constituci n aprobada en oruro con cambios de fondo y forma y la recuperaci n del imperio de la ley mediante el uso racional de la polic a

6151948 fue un paro que se cumpli en cinco ciudades no en cinco regiones a fuerza de amedrentamiento de grupos de choque
6151949 nosotros no somos violentos ni somos golpistas siempre hemos estado contra las dictaduras militares
6151950 este es s lo un precalentamiento para el partido final
6151951 nosotros consideramos que el di logo est abierto y que la mejor soluci n en vez de asumir ese tipo acciones irracionales es sentarnos en una mesa y negociar

6151966 when she chops at the ball the shots are long and have a lot of spin and she doesnt hit them high its difficult to hit them hard
6151967 its like picking the bones out of a piece of fish you have to be patient until you get the chance to attack
6151968 this singles competition will be very tough well definitely face some difficulties so we can only take it one match at a time
6151969 im a little bit disappointed about some of the refereeing decisions made during the set there were three points in a row that he gave to russia the referee called me over and said that our coach would get a yellow card if he continued to talk to the second referee and after i turned around he gave the coach a yellow card
6151970 this gave russia the chance to wake up it was the most important moment of the match
6151971 whatever happens on the weekend im going to be in the history book
6151972 the most troublesome thing were the 10 stitches i have on my chin i was very worried if i get a hit and started oozing blood i may be stopped by the referee from fighting it was a psychological thing which played its part
6151973 with the skill ive got i should beat him every day
6151974 he got ill in 2006 and had a bad time
6151975 but now he has fully recovered from his illness and regained his power
6151976 if we dont at least start by allowing in unskilled laborers for a limited period and for a limited number of times and then come up with long term solutions japan wont have a sufficient work force the deadline is approaching
6151977 theyve increased sharply in the last two to three years
6151978 to reach our target in a country where the people are getting older and the birthrate is getting lower well have to hire either older workers or foreigners
6151979 some stayed the night and in the morning id find them gone
6151980 the air is clean and im not homesick because there are many other chinese here
6151981 its unfortunate that we have to go back home just as we were getting settled here and learning to speak some japanese
6151982 pakistanis will soon find out that musharraf was not the root of all evils
6151983 they solely focused on their common enemy during the last six months and did not address the problems that require immediate attention i hope they now address these issues
6151984 someone from the pakistan peoples party would be the next president of pakistan but i dont know who that would be
6151985 the issue can trigger a dangerous power struggle of the sort that has always provided the military chiefs including musharraf with a justification to intervene
6151986 we hope they behave soberly this time and concentrate on the well being of the poor people of this country who deserve a better future
6151987 i offered to share all my experience with the government to help address complicated issues it was confronting
6151988 the coalition considered me a problem and not a solution
6151989 i feel good i have just proved to the world i am a true champion and with hard work anything is possible
6151990 my technique isnt good enough and i felt a little nervous because all the top 12 throwers are world class athletes
6151991 but i just thought im only competing against myself i dont care how the others are doing i jut tried my best and that was enough i felt a little sorry if i could have done better id have maybe got a silver
6151992 the baseball dream of playing kuo hong chih against a rod or wang chien ming against david ortiz can finally be realized
6151993 the tremendous baseball fan base in taiwan as well as our 2 4 million gaming members will now have the opportunity to play ultimate match up and at the same time understand these teams and players individually
6151994 i would go as far as to award her a separate medal
6151995 i have enormous respect for what she has done and just looking at someone like her is an inspiration
6151996 im not too happy with it 16th place but ill be back for 2012
6151997 my message isnt just to disabled people du toit said
6151998 its to everyone out there that you have to work hard
6151999 it doesnt bother me in the least it is the olympics and the best athlete wins
6152000 how can i just stop and let another athlete win and take another girl take my medal i worked as hard as any other girl and i dont think its unfair
6152001 this is an olympics and everyone wants to get a medal she shouldnt have any hard feelings she won fair and square
6152002 at the end of the race there is obviously going to be a lot of emotion and things happen in races which i wouldnt do because i believe that is not sportsmanship
6152003 but i am not going to sit here and slag someone off because at the end of the day i have the medal
6152004 these new borders are new and somewhat artificial and we in the west never fully measured the effect of this loss of empire on the russians or how integral ukraine is to the russian sense of self
6152005 how do they square their increasing energy dependence on russia with their increasing political discomfort with putin
6152006 will only be reinforced in its view that georgia and ukraine are not ready for nato
6152007 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
6152008 i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia
6152009 the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy
6152010 nato never developed military plans to defend central and eastern europeans because we said russias not an enemy and not a threat and we never backed up the new members with exercises and infrastructure
6152011 russia has never been a nation state but always an empire with muskovy gradually expanding its borders since the 15th century
6152012 russia built a state as it built its empire the two were inseparable
6152013 and we in the west never fully measured the effect of this loss of empire on the russians or how integral ukraine is to the russian sense of self
6152014 the russian conclusion then and its widely shared there is that the limit has been reached no more concessions a push for rollback and definitely no georgia and no ukraine in nato
6152015 we are still in the process of building and making states
6152016 chu had a lot of pressure because he was defending his title and there were a lot of expectations on him
6152017 today his fighting strategies were too conservative and he did not attack enough
6152018 but we still want to show our care and sincerity we believe the athletes tried their best theres no point being bitter we must just work harder
6152019 it seemed to me that all parties are on the same page trying to be helpful and make the process better
6152020 this is a police department that does many things very well and that has a lot to be proud of
6152021 validates what we have been echoing into officials ears for some time
6152022 perhaps now the review panel will use its leverage to fix the known problem
6152023 we take this board very seriously and i think theyve had some great suggestions
6152024 i think that overall these recommendations will make the whole internal affairs process better
6152025 what the superior loves his inferiors will be found to love exceedingly
6152026 we definitely let off the gas in the second set
6152027 we were up 10 points theres no reason to waste energy
6152028 we had to give 100 percent no 120 percent to get past them
6152029 we couldnt allow ourselves to think it was ricardo and emanuel on the other side of the net that would be too emotional we just had to play a really excellent match
6152030 im happy to welcome camping world as the newest partner of kansas speedway
6152031 kansas speedway is about giving the fans the best guest experience in motorsports and i look forward to working with camping world to continue to offer our fans a first class experience

6152034 electronic ear surgery costs 250 000 yuan us 36 400 in china a procedure that not only leaves big wounds but also fails to preserve the remnants of an individuals original listening ability
6152035 the surgery costs about 220 000 yuan in taiwan with more skillful surgeons and preservation of residual hearing
6152036 if i said it was a great ball game that would be an understatement this was softball at its best internationally
6152037 you saw great pitching great defense adjustments at the plate an international tie breaker you saw a little bit of everything the sport has to offer
6152038 i felt like i was shaking the entire game we have so much want to go out on top
6152039 it was a different japan in the medal round i hate to say it but we knew it would be a close game
6152040 the important first step for the international cricket council was gaining recognition of the sport and of the council from the ioc
6152041 that is important particularly for many of our smaller nations because to belong to a sporting body that has recognition from the ioc improves their opportunity for funding
6152042 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
6152043 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasize the international cricket council has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position
6152044 cricketers wont care about the money the chance to stand on top of the olympic podium to wear an olympic gold medal and the pride of belting out your national anthem would be a life changing experience
6152045 marching in an olympic games opening ceremony might give individual cricketers goosebumps
6152046 but as part of the evolution of the game it wouldnt raise a pimple on the backside
6152047 good very good we deserved to be in the final
6152048 it was a dream of the girls to win an olympic medal for the first time and now they have it does not matter who joins us in the final we are ready for anyone
6152049 i have asked the cricket board to drop this item immediately

6152051 the fluorescent stem cell marker is a non intrusive reporter cell that offers a way for confirming that our stem cells are capable of going through mitotic cell division and differentiating into nerve stem cells and mature nerve cells
6152052 though similar markers have been developed abroad our marker has proven to be especially stable
6152053 while other markers may fail to maintain visibility after a few cell divisions ours have sustained more than 100 divisions over the past two years and are still very bright
6152054 by employing thermal chemical transfer we have now differentiated animal feces into 20 percent fuel and 80 percent liquid fertilizer
6152055 if the operation is carried out on a larger scale the technique could be cost effective in the future
6152056 cattle breeding in dairy animals during the hot months is usually harder than in cooler months november to april because of several reasons low appetite delayed release of eggs and if a fertilized egg is produced it may be damaged by the heat
6152057 each selected cow produces several embryos which in turn would be implanted into a number of other cows or heifers
6152058 the technique has two major advantages quality calves can be improved because of the cow selection process and pregnancies in the hot months can be carried out more successfully
6152059 this means that more milk and dairy products can be produced over the summer months
6152060 some evidence suggests that the fault structure may extend even further into the sea and some theories suggest a fault that combines land and sea structures that could produce even bigger earthquakes
6152061 it might be too early to panic simply because the sanchiao fault is found to be longer than expected
6152062 chances of the bureau issuing a land alert are low
6152063 even though the toll is so high you should be proud of what you are doing the work that youre doing here is indispensable
6152064 were gong to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6152065 express the condolences and the pain of the afghan people to the french people for the loss that they have suffered
6152066 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer
6152067 we will see after 72 hours and try to resolve this issue as we are committed to the judges restoration
6152068 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6152069 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6152070 i think other than north korea and china no other country can achieve this in the world
6152071 foreigners admire this this is the chinese spirit we can make our human performance reach such a level through hard and smart work this is something many foreigners cannot achieve
6152072 i have conducted operas in the west it was so troublesome they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks and no overtime work at all there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights this can really worry me to death
6152073 wow one week i thought i should already have rehearsed it the program very smoothly but they could not even stand in straight lines you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kinds of institutions unions
6152074 we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months
6152075 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change
6152076 the result is desynchronization if birds and the insects upon which they depend do not react in the same way we are headed for an upheaval in the interaction between species
6152077 the response is faster than we thought but it is still not fast enough to keep up with climate change
6152078 is most likely changing at its maximal possible rate which is insufficient to catch up to climate change
6152079 this discrepancy may have profound consequences on the ability of species to cope with climate change in the long run
6152080 this is the best average summer api for a decade
6152081 new measures will ensure air quality continues to improve after the games
6152082 for that reason no one who has good intentions toward us and toward the western world should be afraid of it
6152083 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
6152084 four emergency service staff were taken to a nearby hospital after suffering smoke related injuries and nine people who were in the building also suffered from smoke inhalation
6152085 the problem is that the building is built of wood and this helped the fire to spread everyone is working to bring the situation under control
6152086 we still dont know what caused the fire the technical teams will have to come and survey that
6152087 we detected a missile launch from iran on aug 16 and our reports indicated it was unsuccessful
6152088 it certainly didnt get very far off the ground and it definitely did not meet the overall objectives that the iranians reported the test achieved
6152089 theyre not there yet and thats to be expected but this is a step forward that has implications strategically
6152090 the failed launch shows that the purported iranian space program is in its nascent stages at best they have a long way to go
6152091 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
6152092 condemns the mauritanian militarys overthrow of the democratically elected government of mauritania
6152093 organizing free and transparent presidential elections as soon as possible
6152094 condemns the actions of the state council in particular its move to seize the powers of the presidency
6152095 became the hostage of a political entourage that diverted him from his supreme mission
6152096 cannot be described as a coup detat since all the institutions of the republic are working normally and basic freedoms are preserved
6152097 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 10 30 hours
6152098 a great loss for africa and for democracy which mwanawasa defended his entire life
6152099 there are quite a few people who could be contenders but so far no one has put their nose in the air
6152100 we will concentrate on developing our core business including quickening the deployment of next generation networking ngn and optical fiber to provide high resolution content on our multimedia on demand mod service and further investment in 3 5g and 4g or lte
6152101 if vers could be exchanged with un credits companies would have a bigger incentive to increase the use of renewable fuels and acquire the japanese credits
6152102 theres one part of bolivia that just lives off the countrys natural resources and doesnt want to work
6152103 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
6152104 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
6152105 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
6152106 investor confidence was fueled by the surge in the chinese stock market
6152107 investors believed the sell off in financials was overdone and the risk of investing in the shares was low
6152108 yet to finalize the investment details which will be contingent upon the size of land that may be approved by the government
6152109 exports grew 18 4 percent from last year bolstered by a steady increase in shipments to neighboring countries
6152110 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6152111 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6152112 we will take this into consideration and then make a proposal that will not only achieve our goals but will also not affect other diplomatic interests or the interests of cross strait relations
6152113 its a monkey its not like it did anything bad
6152114 dozens of people harmed by the poisonous gas to varying extents were receiving treatment in the crowded hospital
6152115 she is now six months pregnant and we dont know what to do about it its a real embarrassment weve never encountered such a problem before
6152116 we are always thinking about different ways to stop littering and this idea is great and fun
6152117 it is great that you care about the city cool isnt it
6152118 the idea is to make a thing that is considered lifeless alive
6152119 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
6152120 you will need to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
6152121 it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
6152122 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6152123 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6152124 inflation is way too hot and with housing way too cold we have the opposite of a goldilocks economy
6152125 new building codes enacted by new york city accounted for the big jump in permits and starts in june julys 23 6 percent drop in multi family starts and 32 4 percent drop in multi family building permits is mostly payback for junes strong numbers
6152126 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
6152127 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
6152128 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
6152129 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
6152130 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
6152131 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
6152132 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
6152133 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
6152134 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fans who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
6152135 is the single most important factor to their ability to remain liquid
6152136 this whole backstop mechanism was set up so the actual need for it could be avoided
6152137 treasury is monitoring market developments vigilantly we are focused on encouraging market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayers interests
6152138 continues to have strong access to the debt markets at attractive spreads
6152139 the commission proposes the divestiture of two of baas london airports
6152140 guidelines mean that it unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
6152141 there isnt enough competition at uk airports in particular gatwick and heathrow
6152142 there arent enough incentives at the moment for baa to improve their level of customer service and the prices they charge
6152143 one of the criticisms that baa has faced was that they didnt provide enough capacity but simply splitting the owners doesnt necessarily mean three new runways in the southeast
6152144 splitting up the ownership isnt going to solve the capacity issue
6152145 the bonds in which we have invested have not incurred losses but instead have made us more than a billion dollars in the last six months
6152146 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
6152147 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
6152148 he was like im the most hated on so he wanted to do a mixtape with me kind of like the two most hated on or something like that
6152149 the judge said the bond was reasonable and if florida holds him they hold him i can tell you one thing ive never seen this process before on a marijuana case
6152150 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
6152151 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
6152152 we got here this morning and it was absolutely clean
6152153 we thought it was going to be destroyed i guess people are really making a conscious effort
6152154 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
6152155 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6152156 everyone makes choices and that was the choice that was made at this point
6152157 someday the meeting of minds will occur and therell be a nice discussion
6152158 i have never in my life hooked up with michael phelps ew no
6152159 amanda and michael were teammates and thats as far as the relationship went no relationship there

6152171 as leis devem ser feitas por legisladores sensatos na perspectiva que se destinam a encontrar solu es para problemas sociais e n o alterar modelos sociais

6152180 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
6152181 we always knew that every team kind of has a bulls eye on us
6152182 russia that year i cant remember exactly how many games they lost in brazil but i want to say it was three or four it didnt matter they beat us and thats all they thought about it made their tournament it didnt even matter to them that they came in second we knew that but to experience it to hear the entire gym including australian players who were sitting in the stands cheering for russia against us you know to actually experience that is much different than just knowing it and being aware of it so i think we learned a lot from that loss were not going to take anything for granted one game at a time
6152183 you want to go out there and give it your all and play the game like its your last i know ive kind of been in a slump the last few games and i havent performed well since the first two games we played in the preseason i just wanted to come out and make a statement that i was back and let my teammates know that they can have confidence in me again so thats why i came out with a bang
6152184 obviously at this point we know shes hammon going to be there you guys know shes going to be there shes playing for russia right now so just like the rest of their team that makes her the enemy when we step on the court and this is a friend of mine but when we step on the court shes got the russia colors on just like the rest of them and we go to war
6152185 theyve got great size inside with stepanova and osipova two huge players
6152186 the way that we have to respond we have to be strong we have to be physical and we have to stay out of foul trouble because they do a great job getting to the free throw line and then we have to dominate the boards and not let them have second chances
6152187 ive always been intrigued by those people who are out there who you have never heard of who have written a million shows and who still believe in it musical theatre with all their heart and soul
6152188 but i never knew what kind of context to put him in until 9 11
6152189 i dont know why 9 11 made me think about everything in a different way but as an actor i remember auditioning for things back then things that were getting cancelled
6152190 i thought what if somebodys big break was about to happen and for some reason because of 9 11 the show is cancelled and that was sort of the stepping off point for the musical then i had to fill in the rest of his career
6152191 we kind of have the same responses to a lot of things
6152192 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6152193 some of the products have been associated with that investigation
6152194 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6152195 we are closely monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the canadian food inspection agency
6152196 this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side air bags and electronic stability control were rare
6152197 devoted many hours to analyzing and improving the body structure safety belts and air bags of escape and mariner for better performance in front and side impact crashes

6152201 the military was very much trying to take care of its own
6152202 the military even has its own prison for retired officials prosecuted for human rights violations lets just say they are not roughing it
6152203 the chilean system and military autonomy makes prosecuting officers difficult
6152204 pinochet created an amnesty law that remains on the books there needs to be a constitutional amendment to truly open the door for human rights convictions
6152205 people are addicted to online gambling online shopping and online sex

6152211 my sense is that amd is at the low ebb of its competitive position their product story is a lot better than it has been for the past couple of years
6152212 we wanted to see the bills before making a donation and i would like to know what the school board has agreed to donate
6152213 just pay it and not worry about what the school board agreed to
6152214 if the school board decided to donate 2 000 we could end up picking up the rest of the cost
6152215 what if the school board decides to donate 500 are you saying the village will pick up the rest of the cost
6152216 to have some sort of recognition for all of our donations throughout the years we should at least be recognized on one of the sponsor boards at the field
6152217 if we should have the building inspector look at the job before paying the bill
6152218 i am still trying to figure out different things like cost and insurance liability
6152219 after you see the seventh pilot do the same sequence it gets boring

6152221 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
6152222 when i first saw it i just thought that you really really enjoyed programming in java
6152223 how can it be good news that a commercial software company is taking ownership of a free community tool
6152224 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector
6152225 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass

6152293 hed rather have 53 good players than 10 superstars and 43 journeymen the fact that head coach mike mccarthy agrees with this philosophy makes their relationship a strong one and thats why the two were able to get things turned around so quickly
6152294 if the quarterback performs at a very high level hell have to be paid
6152295 theres no way of getting around that but i dont see any other players getting a sniff of eight figures hell try and take care of greg jennings and aaron kampman but only if theyre willing to be reasonable as talented as both of those guys are i still dont see thompson diverting from what he believes in as an ex player he values the whole over the individual and as a gm he believes that he can find suitable replacements when needed

6152300 its still too close to call at guard between three young players
6152301 the next few weeks will decide that competition as well as who the top backups will be at quarterback tight end middle linebacker and cornerback it should be very interesting to watch
6152302 ive seen nothing to suggest that either matt flynn is ready to play at this level i know that coach mike mccarthy has been praising flynn recently but i dont see much to get excited about the young man certainly has poise but hes a bit slow to react in the pocket and hes completed very few passes over 15 yards in training camp i cant imagine opening the regular season with either rookie as the no 2 quarterback
6152303 you know youre in some trouble when colin cole is the no 3 tackle the guy works hard but hes not consistent enough to play significant snaps for a team that expects to play good defensive alfred malone played ok on monday but neither has done enough to ease the teams concerns about the depth on the inside mike montgomery has been almost as productive as cullen jenkins at end this summer thats a problem so is the lack of a pass rush even with a healthy kabeer gbaja biamila im still not convinced that this group is going to get enough pressure on the quarterback
6152304 you can make an argument that jarrett bush has been as good as any of the young corners this summer but i saw enough of him last season to know that hes better in practice than in games thats why i expect s to keep the no 3 job undrafted rookie joe porter has some cover skills and should stick on the practice squad if he clears waivers the coaches seem content with atari bigby at safety but id like to see more of aaron rouse hes a playmaker and thats what this defense really needs

6152316 when race times begin falling like rain questions arise especially when the record setters are from countries such as jamaica and other caribbean nations where there is no independent anti doping federation
6152317 i think quite many recent events have shown that we are rather on the heels of those who try to cheat
6152318 my interpretation is that it is a feature in the increased awareness in the sports population that doping is unaccepted it is unacceptable to compete in the games if you dope yourselves i feel that the figures are encouraging rather than anything else

6152329 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6152330 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6152331 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6152332 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6152333 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent

6152384 lay down the book and looked earnestly at the king as well as the bridegroom giving unequivocal proof of his apprehension that the previous marriage had taken place not content with this tacit allusion the archbishop twice repeated the passage in which the prince engages to live from that time forward in nuptial fidelity with his consort the prince was much affected and shed tears

6152390 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
6152391 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents

6152693 the most under qualified man since george w bush to seek the presidency
6152694 the man who reads nothing at all is better educated than the man who reads nothing but newspapers
6152695 it just started to snowball and we got momentum and it took a lot of hard work lot of phone calls lot of foot work but its been worth it so far because we got it off the ground
6152696 the strength i find is the fact this is a missing part of my life and i need to find my daughter and this is our job now if you have no other job for the rest of your life your job is to find that child that is missing
6152697 prior to the playing card program being implemented we had virtually no calls coming from correctional facilities

6152700 sooner or later someone will hear someone talks it always happens whether its two days from now or five years from now
6152701 murders a big issue and kidnapping you know even though were on this side of the fence most of us dont like those things
6152702 we have a very high turnover which is very good cause we keep on getting different people in here all the time that would give some fresh ideas fresh information
6152703 we havent had anything to date but we have our fingers crossed everyday
6152704 how about some discussion from the mccain campaign about a conservative who can be counted on across the board who can help lead the country in the right direction
6152705 who can help rebuild the republican party lieberman cant do that and rebuild the conservative movement mccain nor lieberman nor ridge can do that
6152706 mccain has already seen to it that he can walk across the aisle that hes the top of the ticket
6152707 if anybody is going to attract moderates its going to be the top of the ticket guy hes not going to help himself any additional way hes going to hurt himself by putting a liberal or a liberal republican on this ticket particularly pro choice
6152708 i think mccain would like to pick him but he voted against samuel alito and is pro choice its hard to imagine the reaction at the convention and the conservatives to that circumstance
6152709 john mccain has some political capital with conservatives right now pro life conservatives but not that much and it would be very easy for him to squander with the wrong choice
6152710 at the end of the day youre only giving your private counsel to the president publicly you echo the presidents position and i think every vice president understands that and appreciates thats the rule
6152711 all i know is that my friend of 25 years john mccain is strongly and forever pro life he also believes that you shouldnt be judgmental on other peoples point of view with regard to this and some other very difficult issues and as i said before i think hell make the right choice for his vice presidential nominee
6152712 the bible says every place the sole of your foot should tread upon ill give it to you
6152713 i walked and believed that if i prayed over that ground if i walked over that ground something good would come of it

6152717 i understand we need to pump our own oil our own gas
6152718 but we dont need to destroy our homes all of our trees and blow ourselves up whos going to be here to enjoy the gas then
6152719 gas drilling has no business in an urban area so i dont want to contribute to a company thats doing that to my community
6152720 were the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood right in the heart of the city
6152721 for those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation is possible
6152722 we want the verdict as far on this side of election day as possible
6152723 the impact on the energy market has been significant as demonstrated by the momentous jump in gas and electricity prices the amount of gas available to export from norway to countries including the uk will be cut significantly and without adequate storage the uk will be left to negotiate with russia and the far east for supplies or risk running low on energy

6152730 when theyre away from their pc they will still have access to their corporate contact list from ocs which doesnt just have contacts names but also their availability
6152731 they will be able to choose how to communicate with that user they may start with a quick instant message in real time as opposed to sms they can see if theyre in a meeting and know not to call them but if its something urgent they can send them a message and have an interactive real time chat they dont have that capability right now if they have ocs and a blackberry
6152732 if i look at my ocs client and i have 50 people on my list and 15 or 20 of them are away from their pc at any moment i cant get to them
6152733 but if they have a mobile solution i can send them a message and its going to pop up on their mobile device instead of their pc
6152734 30 percent of the people are not in front of their pc
6152735 its certainly getting a lot of hype and no one likes paying line rental when they dont use their phone much or at all
6152736 this hidden cost can range from 15 20 so while its typically less than what youd pay for line rental the saving may only be 5 10 depending on what line rental plan youre on

6152745 parenting cannot be defined as biblical if it is not gospel centered
6152746 the gospel should never be ignored or assumed or simply alluded to in the context of parenting
6152747 modeling precedes teaching teaching involves explaining to our children what they are already observing in our lives by example
6152748 any contradiction between our proclamation and our practice undermines our proclamation all consistency between proclamation and practice confirms the authority of the gospel and indeed promotes the attractiveness of the gospel
6152749 what are my children observing as they study me daily and in detail
6152750 if i interview your children and asked what difference does the gospel make to your dad
6152751 think of the difference it will make to be able to say to your child because of your example continue in the faith knowing from whom you learned it think of the difference it will make if you can not say this

6152756 however we havent found extra lifeguards to keep it open any longer
6152757 i cant complain about my race everything i had in me i left it on the track you might find some of my skin cells out there
6152758 usain bolt is the fastest man ive ever seen in my life the 19 30 to me wasnt strange ive watched usain perform all year hes been putting up phenomenal times i watched him do the rounds of the 100m he set a record in that at 9 69 i figured he had a chance to break the record here i just didnt know if he would have it in his legs still after eight rounds that was expected i knew it was going to be a fast race usain is a phenomenal athlete
6152759 hes made history hes broken a 12 year old record held by michael johnson and the same time he crushed the 100 meter record he put on a show tonight to me its just like michael phelps in swimming he raised the bar for us
6152760 god blessed me well wallace got me at the end so did shawn it was a big pr i ran a 19 9 im pretty satisfied with that the best man won today it wasnt me
6152761 its a bittersweet moment in the end hard work always pays off
6152762 i think the first round has always been hard for me after getting through the first round i just knew i had a medal in me i just had to go out and put my race together today i tried to go for the win and came out with a second but i am very happy about that
6152763 i know that i have a very strong finish and if i come out ahead at the turn theyre not going to catch me i just tried to catch melaine walker but she had a very strong finish
6152764 this was the worst race of my life im just very disappointed i dont know what happened the whole race the first 200m i felt like i was in the race i usually switch at six and my switch came on five and i jumped the hurdle with the wrong leg five times it was just a very bad race i dont know what happened
6152765 it wasnt one of my great races i feel like in the middle of my race i kind of got out of control but i was able to pick it up on the last few hurdles with the exception of the last hurdle hopefully tomorrow i will be able to get that back together
6152766 im not going to say its pretty clear people have their favorites but i just hope one of them is me
6152767 i think he made a pretty big statement but that was tonight and tomorrows a different story
6152768 it didnt go as well as i wanted it to but i won the race had no problems and get ready for tomorrow
6152769 the race was just so bad to still be able to run a bad race like that and still win your heat well see what happens tomorrow
6152770 i was just happy to look up and see i had a
6152771 gotta save something for tomorrow it was comfortable bobby wanted me to run a strong 120m and evaluate where i was and control from there
6152772 no i wanted to run as slow as possible to try to make it through im saving it all for tomorrow im just going to go out there and do my best
6152773 i felt pretty good my coach wanted me to get out harder again it felt really easy i didnt break my form
6152774 every time i find something new i didnt break my form its going to be a really good final
6152775 i wanted to place higher but i made the final im not complaining
6152776 i felt great i was way out in nine and i didnt see anyone
6152777 when i saw allyson i stayed with her and she pulled me to a great race
6152778 this is what we train for we just leave it on the track
6152779 it was exactly what i wanted in the first round i havent raced in seven weeks so there is always a little bit of a question of am i going to get out and feel good or am i going to feel flat i tell you what i felt real good that first 200 was just what i wanted instead of getting caught in the back i let myself get up in the hunt a little bit more so i wouldnt have to waste so much energy
6152780 the thing that surprised me was when i got the lead and shut it off like we like to do and reina and yego were right there pushing it i had to re accelerate which is always hard to do in the last 100m but im kind of glad that i had to do it because it shows that i have that kick that im known for it was good competitiveness that you want to see in the preliminary people hunting down those two spots
6152781 the stadium was awesome it was so full just the way it feels i cant even compare it to any football games ive been to it was an awesome stage i wanted so badly to make it to the next round the race was slow i felt alright but i just couldnt close with those guys
6152782 i should have been able to react a little better the first quarter is usually pretty slow and i wasnt ready for it they went out slow and then they dropped the pace from a 53 to like a 49 pace it was a bit of a shock and was hard to stay with they moved forward and i had to try to catch them rookie mistake hopefully ive learned my lesson
6152783 i just think i got lazy in that third 200 i was prepared for them to take it up but they took it up a little quicker than i expected the minute we crossed that first quarter they started running faster usually its about 300 left to go when they start to move and i wasnt ready for it they got away from me i just couldnt react
6152784 it was a little tense in there i definitely didnt feel comfortable until we started running over the last 800 meters there was just so much pushing and shoving so much tripping that you were never able to get into a rhythm when i saw the times i couldnt believe we ran it that slow it just felt like it was a lot harder effort but when we started running i felt great the last 800 was awesome i definitely had gears down the final stretch im very confident going into the finals
6152785 weve been working on it for the last couple of years i think osaka was when it finally dawned on me that i had that ability ever since then ive had confidence in it i dont want to put too much stock into this race everybody was just trying to make it to the final and use as little energy as possible i think i accomplished that and im just looking forward to the final
6152786 it went alright today was slow and i knew that at some point if i dont get to top four i might was well go away again like in the 1500m i didnt want it to happen like the 1500m i wanted to run aggressively even though it was slow and i did i am happy i won it wasnt a very good win it felt really good
6152787 ive had a few problems with my left achilles after the trials and that is why i lost a few weeks of training that resulted in not making the finals in the 1500m but now i am good we have a really good medical staff with team usa over here and they have been taking good care of me im feeling strong right now
6152788 its embarrassing to go out there like that i qualified for worlds in 2005 ran better than that and still didnt qualify i told myself i really didnt want to come back to a championship like this and not be ready to go i did it again and its just a bad feeling to finish up like that i think i let the whole thing get in my head a little bit i tried to go out there and soak it up a little bit look around it made me a little more nervous i think of all of the things i did right at the trials run like ive got nothing to lose i just didnt do that today i didnt give a good effort and its my fault i had a couple of bad races in europe that i let get in my head i think physically i am ready to go but mentally it just wasnt there and im really sorry
6152789 it was a long competition i think one pit had it worse than the other on our pit everything was okay i struggled a little bit out there at first im feeling good today was a good learning lesson i was coming around there at the end

6152793 if their concern is how this amenity will affect their community on a real estate level itll only help increase the traffic and interest for all neighboring communities

6152810 i was definitely in control of the race when i got to the 320 mark my right hamstring grabbed on me and i just couldnt move it any more

6152837 probably from 2007 to 2008 its even more than that
6152838 because the scooters are not fast enough to get you into trouble physically and theyre not slow enough to get passed all the time so theyre kind of in this sweet spot where they just keep up with traffic which is the safest place to be
6152839 we even have a prominent local surgeon who rides between all the hospitals for emergency surgeries on a scooter
6152840 i always tell people your head is a lot softer than the concrete on the ground
6152841 my big things are closed toed shoes no flip flops
6152842 there are ways to gear up and still look good of course
6152843 if im wearing a skirt or a dress that day i just throw a pair of jeans on underneath for the ride to work and take them off when i arrive

6152863 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6152864 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6152865 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6152866 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6152867 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6152868 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6152869 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6152870 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6152871 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6152872 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6152873 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6152874 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6152875 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6152876 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6152877 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6152878 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6152879 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6152880 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6152881 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6152882 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6152883 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6152884 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6152885 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom

6153004 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6153005 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6153006 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6153007 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6153008 the new york police department violated core constitutional rights when it arrested a group of peaceful demonstrators who were lawfully protesting against the commencement of the iraq war and those who stood to profit from it
6153009 we are gratified by the citys decision to compensate these individuals whose targeted arrests were without probable cause and intended to quell future protest in new york city this lawsuit and this settlement vindicates our clients rights to assemble and speak their mind free from the fear that they will be punished for their views
6153010 my question is why did the nypd send over 100 police in riot gear along with vehicles to block the street and disrupt the flow of morning rush hour traffic all to stop a legal peaceful protest when there are far more important matters they could be pursuing and why did they fight us in court so doggedly when they knew the evidence proved that we were arrested without any police orders to leave
6153011 we hope our victory helps convince the city to stop violating peoples rights as a matter of policy and stop wasting taxpayers money doing so

6153037 what passes for conservative policy is nothing but a series of hopelessly vague ambitions they would rather repeatedly tell us that we are broken than say what they would do to fix things the only genuine policy they have is a tax break for the richest 6 of people

6153088 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
6153089 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
6153090 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
6153091 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time

6153102 access to apples online itunes store has been blocked in china after it emerged that olympic athletes have been downloading and possibly listening to a pro tibetan music album in a subtle act of protest against chinas rule over the province
6153103 the album called s ongs for tibet was produced by an a group called the art of peace foundation and features 20 tracks from well known singers and songwriters including sting moby suzanne vega and alanis morissette
6153104 it was released as a download on the itunes store on august 5 three days before the start of the olympics with the physical cd launched on tuesday this week
6153105 the foundation provided free downloads of the album to olympic athletes urging them to play the songs on their ipods during the games as a show of support
6153106 funds raised from the sale of the album are being used by the non profit foundation to support
6153107 on monday expatriate itunes users living in china began experiencing technical problems with their previously unfettered access
6153108 that was the same day the us based campaign for tibet organisation claimed on its website that over 40 olympic athletes in north america europe and even beijing had downloaded the album
6153109 a blogger calling herself jeninshanghai has reposted what she says is a reply she received from apples customer support after reporting that she had problems with her us itunes store account
6153110 itunes is not being blocked in china from our end but access to the itunes store is restricted in some areas in china

6153128 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6153129 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
6153130 the purpose of future farm is to take a lot of the technologies and processes that weve been developing in precision agriculture and actually integrate them together into a farm management situation
6153131 so were not going to be developing necessarily any new technologies or any new real ideas but learn how to bring them together
6153132 were also looking at the socio economic aspects looking at biofuels and we also have one part looking at robotics
6153133 well that s an issue of adoption and ive actually written some papers on adoption where weve been looking at why precision farming hasnt actually gone into the mainstream
6153134 and one of the main reasons is as ive said this level of complexity as scientists and engineers we can produce a map of many many different things soil types nutrient holding capacity and so on but actually how many of these things are relevant to management decision and the secondly even if they are relevant the tools that make them available arent readily available for the farmer so another aspect to the problem with the adoption of precision is the timeliness so therefore we have the knowledge but we dont necessarily have all the tools and those tools are not integrated so these are the aspects were trying to build

6153279 overall people have been calling and saying john mccain did an outstanding job
6153280 i have a 25 year pro life record in the congress in the senate and as president of the united states i will be a pro life president
6153281 mccain was so incredibly decisive and he was so clear in his answers there was no gray area
6153282 they feel like this is the start of john mccains coming out in terms of embracing the conservative evangelicals
6153283 i think they needed to hear it and they needed to hear it when the question was asked in that way that protections need to come at the moment of conception
6153284 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6153285 most people they dont do this for a living they dont study a candidates record and even when they see a record it has to be backed up by the candidate talking about it and making it important
6153286 people were before just kind of wringing their hands thinking what kind of mess do we have here what kind of choice do we have
6153287 i think he stopped the ambivalence that was out there toward john mccain
6153288 when they see mccains actual position and him talking about it it makes a difference instead of looking at roll call tallies
6153289 this became clearly no longer that this is the best of the two choices and moved from that over to this is a great great candidate that we need to get behind
6153290 either he had a heartfelt conversion on saturday or this is more manipulative electioneering
6153291 what saturday night provided was the closest view of the contrast between the two candidates that weve seen
6153292 when you have eight nine ten eleven twelve candidates running it takes people a while to get enthused
6153293 when you have a choice between someone you agree with on 80 percent of issues and someone who agreed with you on zero the choice becomes crystal clear
6153294 i think he will come a lot closer to sealing the deal if he picks a pro life running mate

6153304 as an it company cobweb believes it has a responsibility to lead the way by reducing our own environmental impact and by working with our customers we can achieve even more that is what our new green community
6153305 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too
6153306 as a hosted it services provider cobweb works hard to keep our environmental impact to a minimum we also help our customers to reduce their own environmental footprint by reducing the need to maintain energy hungry servers on their premises
6153307 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives
6153308 we have all been there we call for service only to be 134 in the queue when we simply need a balance update or tracking number consumers are increasingly mobile and interact with a myriad of companies through call centers often using their mobile phones they demand quick response times and easy to use systems
6153309 our customers prefer sms it saves them the trouble of having to dial in to the call center or visit a branch to get the account information they need with sms our customer gets convenience and fnb saves money in addition to delivering a better customer experience sms has also greatly reduced call center costs associated with communicating routine account information
6153310 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6153311 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6153312 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6153313 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6153314 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6153315 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations
6153316 the scientific community the public and now the highest court in the nation have all called for action to confront the crisis of global warming all the institutions of government are now moving towards recognition of the dangers of global warming except the bush administration the administration needs to stop blocking progress in addressing this critical issue the courts decision will also further turn up the heat on congress to act on climate change legislation
6153317 if kandahar could have retaliated with similar strikes against washington it would have
6153318 i came back to washington because i am a part of this system my constituents said
6153319 this is the peoples house this is where your problems get solved but the speaker brought the gavel down without a solution
6153320 this congress can solve this problem it can be solved by doing all of the above we have an incredible amount of resources and all of the above is all that we are asking for
6153321 you cant be truly independent as a nation if you depend on someone else for your energy
6153322 we are excited about both campaigns and we are confident that the support of these two actors will capture the viewers attention consequently boosting subscriptions for each respective magazine
6153323 i never thought i would hear myself saying this while i am not endorsing senator john mccain the possibility is there that i might
6153324 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6153325 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6153326 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6153327 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6153328 college colors day has been embraced by organizations businesses state governments and most importantly colleges and universities from across the country
6153329 we hope college colors day becomes a lasting and memorable tradition for all participants for years to come
6153330 some of the products have been associated with that investigation
6153331 consumers can take some solace in the sell off but there are more supportive factors down the road here
6153332 we know what we need on a global level in terms of reductions
6153333 we cannot continue forever saying this is an issue for the industrial countries and no one else should do anything
6153334 the author is obviously not familiar with the 5 towns were so many supermarkets offer just that i e brachs supersol and gourmet glatt im wondering if its actually bigger than brachs in lawrence
6153335 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
6153336 but they can also be taken away at any time
6153337 china is riding roughshod over its promises to allow lawful protests during the games
6153338 show that while china has now proven it is able to host international events to perfection it still has a long way to go before it respects even minimal international human rights standards
6153339 we have no records of these two names in our system
6153340 in china like in other countries to apply for a demonstration you have to obey the law
6153341 defending the rights of the people is still such a difficult thing even 60 years after the establishment of the republic
6153342 v lkermord wie vom internationalen gerichtshof behauptet gibt es nicht

6153344 wir werden keinen sudanesischen b rger an irgendjemanden zur strafverfolgung ausliefern
6153345 wir sind ein unabh ngiger staat mit einem unabh ngigen und fairen justizsystem
6153346 ich wei nicht ob ich schreien weinen oder lachen soll
6153347 das ist wie wenn ein basejumper drei mal am tag gegen einen gegner von der eiger nordwand springt
6153348 we selected task manager on the basis of its rich feature set proven reliability and ability to scale across our enterprise
6153349 we are honored and delighted that autozone is joining some of the worlds best known retailers that have increased sales reduced costs and improved customer service by implementing reflexis solutions for task management and merchandising category management
6153350 autozone has a long history of leveraging technology and new business processes to improve the efficiency of its supply chain we look forward to driving similar efficiency improvements in autozones in store operations and corporate planning while improving customer service and ensuring the consistent store level execution of corporate strategy
6153351 they dont have insight on how bad losses are going to get
6153352 our role is to make accessible resources needed for the countrys energy security
6153353 thats been the trend over the last few years basically whats left is youve got to go deeper youve got to go out further youve got to go to places that havent been explored
6153354 you cant assume that every lease that everybody has is going to produce oil
6153355 we are always delighted when people recognize covenant for its strong program
6153356 we take such recognition with a very large grain of salt in that we dont consider it a goal nor do we modify anything we do in order to gain it but its wonderful to hear such confirmation of our efforts
6153357 the forbes criteria certainly correspond to some features of covenant that we take very seriously outstanding faculty students and alumni overall financial value and graduation rates
6153358 we shouldnt wait until a worse human catastrophe occurs before acting
6153359 presents an opportunity for the region to negotiate and secure tangible assistance for people already affected by climate change
6153360 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present and your communities are facing the adverse impacts everyday
6153361 im sorry sweetheart daddy took the sports section to work today

6153365 aberdeens research shows that even though organizations are able to achieve strong benefits from outsourcing network management to a third party almost a half of these organizations are not fully satisfied with the quality of service that they are receiving
6153366 this is mostly due to the fact that organizational goals for network management are rapidly changing and organizations are expecting more than cost savings and network up time but are still struggling to adjust slas to help them achieve these newly expanded goals

6153370 the government of canada is pleased to be working with the province of british columbia and the town of princeton to provide ways that make it easier for area businesses to have access to essential information and reduce paperwork costs
6153371 this approach is consistent with other measures announced in budget 2008 and in our overall economic plan advantage canada which will provide an innovative and entrepreneurial business environment for canadians

6153375 id like to thank council for their support in bringing bizpal to the town of princeton
6153376 es hat mir viel spa gemacht und wurde dann immer mehr zur leidenschaft
6153377 eigentlich wollte ich im ersten jahr nur erfahrungen sammeln es haben sich aber auch erfolge eingestellt
6153378 wenn man sich den stra enbelag ansieht handelt es sich dabei nicht um moderne kunst wie man bei oberfl chlicher betrachtung meinen k nnte sondern um den versuch der stra enmeisterei leoben die teilweise sehr desolate l 127 nach radmer zu sanieren
6153379 dass man beim aufbringen des warmen bitumens noch zus tzlich sand dar ber streut ndert daran nicht viel
6153380 die situation ist schwierig f r eine totale sanierung mit asphalt oder einen neuen berzug der fahrbahnoberfl che ist das geld nicht vorhanden um die stra e bestm glich vor weiteren frostaufbr chen zu sch tzen m ssen wir einen fugenverguss durchf hren
6153381 nach dem verfugen schaut das f r das auge des laien sicherlich wild aus in der form eines spinnennetzes aber es ist ein schutz vor dem totalen verfall der stra e jede weitere frostperiode verschlimmert die situation weiter wenn wasser in die fugen eintritt
6153382 dieses verfahren k nnen wir nicht in eigenregie durchf hren daf r haben wir weder das entsprechende material noch ger tschaften das kann nur eine firma machen
6153383 to search for information on the web particularly by using the google search engine
6153384 we think its important to make the distinction between using the word google to describe using google to search the internet and using the word google to describe searching the internet it has some serious trademark issues
6153385 the move toward offering certification and training in search marketing is accelerating
6153386 wir haben zwar fest mit der veranstaltung gerechnet haben sie sogar im folder vom k rntner heimatherbst angek ndigt aber nun m ssen wir ihn f r heuer absagen

6153389 search marketing thoughts news and review by members of the minnesota interactive marketing association
6153390 i think you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their mortgages what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps
6153391 these are the issues they want us to address and look at youll see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6153392 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6153393 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and economic progress over the last three decades but much more remains to be done
6153394 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests
6153395 my name is mud i should die for what i did
6153396 he was so far off base its unbelievable that no one challenged his expertise or methodology
6153397 anyone paying attention for the last 20 years would have known that what he was saying was totally off the wall

6153404 heutige windenergieanlagen der megawattklasse haben einen rotordurchmesser bis zu 126 metern
6153405 br cken und hochh user sind f r diese hochdynamischen lasten nicht ausgelegt daher ist es eher unwahrscheinlich dass diese bauwerke diese gro en turbinen tragen k nnen
6153406 man kann sie so klein machen dass die leute sie f r einen teil des designs halten
6153407 wenn berhaupt w ren nur wesentlich kleinere anlagen vorstellbar die allerdings signifikant weniger leistung erbringen
6153408 blicherweise stehen gr ere windenergieanlagen auch gar nicht im stadtgebiet sondern dort wo die windverh ltnisse g nstig sind ausreichend platz f r die anlagen ist und man sie auch sicherheitstechnisch ohne bedenken errichten kann
6153409 man w rde man die anlagen vom land aus dann auch nicht mehr sehen k nnen
6153410 und sie werden auch effektive umr stungen bereits bestehender gro er bauten beinhalten

6153412 parts of the walls have fallen off the fence is destroyed cars are buried under the rubble
6153413 the blast pulverized the bombers body into pieces with bits of his limbs strewn meters away
6153414 nearby were pools of blood watches tattered clothes and a mobile telephone still ringing
6153415 we understand that for mobile developers especially its all about content and content thats looking good
6153416 but they have the added challenge of having to create great looking applications that have to run consistently across different platforms and to do it in days rather than weeks
6153417 i think swing developers will find lwuit very interesting since it goes places swing cant go and picked up lots of ideas from swings experience
6153418 take a big step back and literally fuck your own face

6153421 cusack grew up in a massive house on sheridan road

6153426 jamaican men have little respect for their women you can tell this by their music alone
6153427 we think that this is the biggest most fundamental change we have made
6153428 from 2000 to the end of 2007 ebay kind of fought the trends they tried to keep auctions the focus of the company
6153429 we believe by making the fees more success based buyers will have more choice better values and that sellers will sell more
6153430 we wanted to make sure that the trust factors were in place
6153431 the vocal minority is going to be exceedingly vocal about this
6153432 i think it is a great step and for the fixed price sellers it is a big step
6153433 it suddenly starts being several hundred dollars worth of interest charges
6153434 as issuers have discovered the small business segment they have become fairly aggressive about getting small business cards into the hands of some very early stage businesses
6153435 banks may want to consider do we want to encourage them to deposit checks at all
6153436 the bank has an even higher burden around fraud detection
6153437 it would be incorrect to say that there is no potential for fraud our responsibility and i think we meet that is to be sure that we stay abreast of the security protocols and the security activities that will make the transactions as secure as absolutely possible
6153438 the fact is society is changing and now financial institutions want to make that change
6153439 i think it would be a foolish mistake to bypass this opportunity
6153440 checks at the corporate level are going to be around for years and years and years
6153441 for example seafood is one of the few wild foods still consumed by large numbers of people though we know that the mercury found in marine fish and shellfish poses a threat to humans not to mention the ecosystem itself we know very little about the physical and geochemical processes that link mercury in the atmosphere to the toxic form found in seafood
6153442 fate and bioavailability of mercury in aquatic ecosystem and effects on human exposure
6153443 science should inform regulatory and public health decisions about issues such as the accumulation of mercury in our environment
6153444 the superfund basic research program provides support for workshops such as these that interpret findings in terms useful to decision makers that incorporate their perspectives into the research agenda
6153445 wir haben wirklich eine deutsche sportlerin bei den olympischen spielen die geht
6153446 wer gehen mal ausprobiert hat wei dass man die technik nicht auf anhieb beherrscht und dass es auch gar nicht so einfach oder komisch ist wie es vielleicht aussieht
6153447 ich habe mich so gefreut an dem tag gab es auch keine medaillen f r deutsche sportler das war mein gl ck und so durfte ich als f nfte sogar zu beckmanns olympia nacht die medien haben so positiv berichtet weil ich mich so gefreut habe eine almsick h tte man wegen eines f nften platzes verh hnt
6153448 wenn der sportler zeigt wie viel die eigene leistung wert ist wissen die medien das auch wertzusch tzen und wenn die dann mitspielen und dich pushen dann h tten die leute viel mehr ahnung und w rden auch den sport fter gucken die medien haben es in der hand
6153449 genauso professionell wie ein fu baller tennisspieler oder 100 meter l ufer aber geher stehen nicht so im mittelpunkt
6153450 aber wenn ein weitspringer bertritt gilt der sprung auch nicht und der geher wird ja vorher auch mehrfach gewarnt
6153451 man kann so viele verwarnungen bekommen wie man will aber entscheidend sind die antr ge bei drei antr gen ist schluss die m ssen aber von drei verschiedenen wettkampfrichtern gegeben werden
6153452 wenn man einmal mitgemacht hat will man immer wieder hin die ganze welt schaut zu alle sportarten finden zusammen statt das ist was ganz besonderes man hat die chance sich die anderen disziplinen anzuschauen
6153453 im olympischen dorf muss man die olympiakleidung des landes tragen dadurch erkennt man sich das ist toll man lernt so viele leute kennen und ist nie alleine
6153454 ich schwimme gern gegen nicht behinderte ich m chte nichts geschenkt bekommen
6153455 es w re gro artig wenn sie auch eine goldmedaille bekommen w rde

6153487 what do you do when a blogger becomes the chief source of information about whats going on inside your company for employees of that company thats the conundrum thats facing
6153488 the conundrum for gannett is what to do about hopkins so far its chosen a strategy of benign neglect which is a huge mistake hopkins
6153489 one of the great ironies of watching the newspaper industry collapse has been to see the same media icons that have long scolded institutions for their insularity become reclusive and inwardly focused when the spotlight is turned on them gannet blog is exhibit a in how not to handle a new influencer

6153492 this is not a football game with an offense and a defense

6153498 a weekly q amp a column where ap journalists respond to readers questions about the news
6153499 the ssa assumes that about half of unauthorized immigrants pay social security taxes
6153500 during the 2003 2004 school year its state and local govern ments spent between 79 million and 118 million to educate an estimated 9 400 to 14 000 children who were unauthorized immigrants
6153501 birthright citizens im using 2 million to show how going with even low range assumptions generates huge costs
6153502 the state estimated that local governments incurred 1 4 billion in uncompensated costs for health care and law enforcement
6153503 in general immigrants are less likely than native born citizens to be incarcerated

6153506 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
6153507 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
6153508 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
6153509 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
6153510 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
6153511 among other things and i for one forgive him he also talks a bit about his onscreen kiss with
6153512 it wasnt twelve hours but it certainly felt like it
6153513 the rst kiss of the movie was out on haight street with like 200 people watching outside it was a crane shot im sure in the end it will be a really cool shot but it starts close and then it takes maybe a minute
6153514 thats a long time on film with everybody watching and like a fake mustache getting in your mouth
6153515 was long enough that you couldnt help thinking oh my god im kissing spicoli
6153516 i have previously advised liverpool over two danes with daniel agger and nicola savic both of whom they purchased and are almost too happy with
6153517 i gave them mathias jorgensens name a long time ago and liverpool are wild about him they are keeping very good track of him
6153518 liverpool see him as a very promising youngster like i do and clearly just like a player who will play for the danish national team for many years to come
6153519 hes just a great guy hes awesome and really really talented

6153527 we are very excited to be joining forces with such an environmentally conscious county such as harvey county
6153528 we believe that the amount of waste that ends up having to be dumped in a landfill will be reduced by 85 to 90 the county its administration and its commissioners are very pro active in searching out green alternatives the fact that they were willing to lease over 32 acres of their land their existing transfer station and over 10 pieces of waste processing and hauling equipment for only a dollar per year shows their commitment to making their dream of not burying trash a reality we hope that the 5 of net profits from the sale of products made by biogold will be used by harvey county to improve what is already a wonderful county

6153530 his representation of consumers manufacturers utilities the commonwealth and the commission itself has given him a complete understanding of all the challenging and important issues before the scc
6153531 virginia deserves an impartial scc that will act in the consumer interest
6153532 the fact is that mr dimitri is unique in that he has the broadest perspective on the work of the state corporation commission that an individual could have

6153536 we can bounce back even if its going to be very complicated
6153537 michael probably wont be and mark viduka certainly wont be
6153538 i probably could rush michael back and then knock him back five or six weeks
6153539 we are probably strong enough to do without the two of them but when they come back it will give us a massive boost
6153540 we took a young squad nine of our eighteen players are able to return next season so it was a good learning experience for them and of course we did miss aaron spears goal scoring ability

6153567 watching television can slow the development of children under 3 even when it involves channels aimed specifically at them
6153568 television viewing hurts the development of children under 3 years old and poses a certain number of risks encouraging passivity slow language acquisition over excitedness troubles with sleep and concentration as well as dependence on screens
6153569 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6153570 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6153571 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves

6153573 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6153574 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

6153576 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6153577 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6153578 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6153579 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6153580 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6153581 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6153582 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6153583 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6153584 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6153585 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6153586 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6153587 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6153588 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6153589 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6153590 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6153591 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6153592 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6153593 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6153594 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6153595 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6153596 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6153597 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6153598 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6153599 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6153600 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6153601 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6153602 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6153603 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6153604 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6153605 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6153610 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6153611 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6153612 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6153613 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6153614 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6153615 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6153616 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6153617 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6153618 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6153619 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6153620 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6153621 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6153622 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6153623 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6153624 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6153625 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6153626 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6153627 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6153628 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6153629 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6153630 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6153631 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6153632 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6153633 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6153634 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6153635 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6153636 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6153637 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6153638 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6153639 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6153640 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6153641 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6153642 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6153643 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6153644 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6153645 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6153646 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6153647 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6153648 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6153649 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6153650 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6153651 i long for tims voice in this election luke channels tim better than anybody i know hes trying something new for a while its not like theyre making him bureau chief
6153652 tim got me into nbc and got me out of nbc
6153653 he kept every promise he ever made to me he promised i wouldnt fail and he made sure i didnt
6153654 he told me to make sure i police my own information flow with the understanding that a lot of people will be trying to discern what i might ask i shouldnt tip my hand any question should be mine and mine alone
6153655 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6153656 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6153657 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6153658 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6153659 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6153660 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6153661 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6153662 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6153663 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6153664 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6153665 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6153666 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6153667 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6153668 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6153669 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6153670 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6153671 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6153672 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6153673 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6153674 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6153675 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6153676 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6153677 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6153678 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6153679 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6153680 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6153681 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6153682 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6153683 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6153684 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6153685 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6153686 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6153687 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6153688 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6153689 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6153690 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6153691 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6153692 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6153693 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6153694 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6153695 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6153696 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6153697 this is a planning took where all things are going
6153698 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6153699 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6153700 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6153701 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6153702 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6153703 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6153704 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6153705 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6153706 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6153707 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6153708 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6153709 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6153710 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6153711 if wed known it was yours we never would have taken it
6153712 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6153713 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6153714 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6153715 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6153716 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6153717 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6153718 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6153719 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6153720 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6153721 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6153722 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6153723 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6153724 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6153725 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6153726 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6153727 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6153728 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6153729 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6153730 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6153731 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6153732 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6153733 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6153734 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6153735 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6153736 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6153737 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6153738 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6153739 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

6153743 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6153744 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6153745 in the present case the mdc has not consented to the convening of the parliament
6153746 any decision to convene parliament will be a clear repudiation of the mou and an indication beyond reasonable doubt of zanu pfs unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks

6153790 telah datang kepada kalian bulan ramadhan bulan yang penuh berkah allah telah mewajibkan kepada kalian untuk berpuasa pada bulan itu allah membuka pintu pintu surga dan menutup pintu pintu neraka
6153791 tetapi jikalau mereka benar terhadap allah niscaya yang demikian itu lebih baik bagi mereka

6153795 we contacted mr biscardi who gave us permission to begin an expedited melting process we set up a salamander heater to heat the freezer
6153796 within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head as i was now able to touch it i was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm but unusually hollow in one small section
6153797 within the next hour of thaw a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6153798 the motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time it is still unclear why whitton who being a police officer for the clayton county police department in georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in a scheme to defraud in a felonious manner
6153799 at this time the victim of this series of deceptions searching for bigfoot inc is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and many people so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt let us all try to be mindful of such

6153808 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
6153809 users may wish to begin a private browsing session to research a medical condition or plan a surprise vacation or birthday party for a loved one
6153810 the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose
6153811 the user is in control of what information the browser makes available to web sites
6153812 the prior express written agreement of the recipient to receive such calls
6153813 everyone has their own individual reason for looking at it
6153814 im really not sure what motivates a person to be that interested in it because to some people its the last thing in the world they even want to talk about
6153815 they didnt have enough students for the class they canceled it out so they also kind of canceled out our purpose for being there
6153816 we were looking for a place to go and thats when dave offered walstroms
6153817 you like to keep it in a roundtable format where someone can speak and everyone will listen
6153818 we just like the opportunity to talk about the civil war
6153819 you run into a certain friendship kinship based on the fact that were all kind of interested in the same thing
6153820 you begin to see the normal group show up all the time you see them around town and you know what theyre interested in
6153821 we havent studied since ive been here a major battle because thats been done well take either a small part of that battle or some of the smaller battles leading up to it
6153822 what we really kind of study is how did the men live how were they equipped what did they eat that kind of stuff
6153823 public education had become such that the average guy was fairly literate and would write home
6153824 it took the story of the war out of the historians and gave it to the guy that was on the ground he could have his own observation of it rather than what the official observation was and put his own thoughts in it
6153825 they felt so strongly there was vengeance and death and suffering
6153826 this was actually one of the first parts of the trail we wanted to finish
6153827 this is really going to make transportation easier its a really busy part of us 31 and this will solve a lot of bicycle issues
6153828 when this is finished i dont think there will be a nicer trail in the state of michigan
6153829 we didnt want to fall into the trap of being your fathers restaurant
6153830 because those things would send me straight to the er
6153831 we test and work with our athletes all year they all have different preferences on how they want their suspension to be set up and we work with them so they can get the most out of their suspension
6153832 we have been working with athletes to develop the next generation inertia valve and some of the athletes felt it provided such a performance advantage they had to have it for the biggest race of their career
6153833 maybe three people out of a class of more than 1 000

6153843 how do you explain the deployment of the army on the srinagar jammu highway if there is no blockade
6153844 daniel craig is urging movie bosses to revolutionize the james bond franchise by including a gay scene

6153849 thou shalt rise up before the hoary head and honour the face of the old man and fear thy god i am the lord
6153850 easy you just chip away everything that doesnt look like elephant
6153851 i would like to commend the canada border services agency cbsa for the speedy removal of mr giuseppe coluccio from canada this is a great example of canadas ability to coordinate efforts to combat transnational organized crime and expedite immigration enforcement proceedings as i have stated before canada is not a safe haven for individuals who have gained admission to canada by concealing their involvement in serious and organized crime
6153852 i think you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their mortgages what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps
6153853 these are the issues they want us to address and look at youll see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6153854 go head put the price on it now im gon beat the breaks off their asses when i see them again we kill each other over a color so what you think well do to them over dissin us

6153865 yo no soy un inv lido simplemente no tengo piernas
6153866 we figure there is about one ambulance for every 6 000 year round residents in emmet county
6153867 a lot of people dont realize just how vulnerable we are ems is the eyes ears and hands of the emergency room physicians and we have to be able to respond in a way that fits everyones needs
6153868 ambulances have evolved a lot in the 34 years ive been in the business
6153869 allied is extremely proud of the education we are able to provide
6153870 without the tax it would definitely see cutbacks and there is already a nation wide shortage of paramedics right now
6153871 the community deserves the highest level of ambulance care and we take a lot of pride in what we do
6153872 the quality of the care being provided doesnt start when the patient arrives at the hospital its when ems arrives at the home so often that gets forgotten
6153873 i want to say that human rights matters to us every year not just in the olympic year
6153874 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion china has made enormous social and economic progress over the last three decades but much more remains to be done
6153875 i firmly believe that allowing chinas citizens to enjoy freedom of expression and association to worship how and where they wish and to live in confidence that the rule of law will be applied consistently and impartially is not only the right thing to do but will also benefit chinas future stability and prosperity which is in all our interests
6153876 while these extras may offer variety and entertainment for some consumers they are also the subject of ongoing complaints
6153877 the accc is particularly concerned over what it considers is the failure of certain advertisements to adequately disclose the costs and ongoing nature of the services offered
6153878 what was once a nice neighborhood is going downhill because that place is a haven for people who are using drugs
6153879 its scary we have people walking across our property to go in there to do drugs at all hours of the night

6153882 this alarm clock steals your mobile phone and randomly shuffles through your contact list and calls someone every three minutes after the desired wake up time
6153883 watching cc made me realize a whole bunch of things
6153884 he was making good hitters not real comfortable and thats a great sign
6153885 hes been building toward this and hopefully he can maintain some of it
6153886 i cant believe i got in that state because it is totally not in my repertoire to do something like that im actually a bit of control freak

6153889 we went in and asked partners how they grew their businesses how they insured they had adequate coverage
6153890 they said to us we build an ecosystem just like you do
6153891 they dont buy from us and they dont resell were not asking them to sell were asking them to smell for deals
6153892 some people are very selective and timid about joining vendor programs to come in and swallow the whole till
6153893 other times we have some associate partners who joined the program but havent been as successful as they had hoped they can step from the partner edge program to the extended business partner program
6153894 there has been a constant military campaign that clearly is very difficult to achieve largely because the region is mountainous and the local population is either indifferent or sympathetic to the extremists
6153895 the algerian authorities are facing a major problem in terms of conceiving a way of dealing with this
6153896 the government is not openly dictatorial but it is incompetent and unresponsive
6153897 unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6153898 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory
6153899 the armed groups no longer have the ability overturn power by force and install the islamic republic for which they are fighting and killing citizens

6153904 we feel this is great news for both cbc and the canadian sports system
6153905 for over 50 years cbc has been canadas pre eminent broadcaster of canadian sport we feel with the addition of another platform we will continue to be a great contributor to canadas success in sports at all levels
6153906 following on the success of our beijing olympic coverage we feel cbc will now be able to make an even more significant contribution to the success of our canadian athletes
6153907 the beijing games look set to become the biggest broadcasted event in olympic history
6153908 that had an audience of 40 million in the united states
6153909 in china alone more than 102 million people watched the games live on line
6153910 this is because now there are many more media platforms available
6153911 wouldnt even allow protests in their own designated protest zones in beijing protests that couldnt possibly have hurt anyone
6153912 there used to be some sensitive events and days when we would be watched such as june 4th
6153913 but now its happening more and more it seems to me that extra sensitivity will continue after the olympics
6153914 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released
6153915 i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again
6153916 one of texas emerging photography superstars has a new style that is fresh and creative a photographer who is cutting edge has great use of light composition and originality

6153922 they suckle for 11 or 12 months so its a long time wed just agree itd be very difficult
6153923 we think it really needs to find its mother or foster mother and those are really the only chances
6153924 the commander in chief must always listen to the commanders and not the latest
6153925 americas future leaders must remember that the will be won on the offense and thats where our military must stay
6153926 you live by a code and you fight for a cause and im honored to be your commander in chief
6153927 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6153928 this is all about freedom it has nothing to do with sex
6153929 this morning clay county is open they may give us a call and tell us to pick the kids up early if they do ill probably drive in the mean time were just trying to make it in

6153935 its just amazing how many people come flocking to this thing with smiles on their faces
6153936 to capture the 20 second audience in transit and get a smile on their face is unbelievably rewarding
6153937 we went for this because we wanted to create something that would be very high technology in our building that would communicate the high technology business that were in
6153938 when you go into lots of media companies very often you see televisions in their lobbies big screens with network content on it we thought that we wanted to do something more sophisticated than that
6153939 and now there are thousands of people coming in to see the wall shop to visit the cafe fountain or just hang around
6153940 theres a certain thing that people would expect to see up on a screen like that
6153941 and weve gone to great lengths to create the unexpected

6154033 we decided to do a cover on this disc and we didnt want to do what every other band is doing these days and take a pop or rock song from the 80s
6154034 we figured a song by a band with real metal cred would do best for us this song never got the attention it deserved its an amazingly well written song and even though its not the most complex song nevermore has done it is in my opinion one of their best we ran the idea by nevermore and they gave us their blessing so we were very happy to have the original artists behind it i couldnt be happier with the way it came out
6154035 we are actively seeking innovative and exciting products to add to our successful range of titles we are looking to expand the subject and content of products and are keen to meet with anyone at the show who would like to showcase their ideas to us

6154046 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
6154047 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
6154048 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
6154049 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
6154050 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
6154051 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
6154052 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
6154053 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag

6154062 we started asking questions early so no one was evicted and no one lost housing over this
6154063 but yes this potentially could have really hurt some low income families out there
6154064 i was a banker for 15 years my last position was actually as director and executive vice president
6154065 ive had a long and winding road to this position up here in front of you
6154066 ive learned a lot about what makes a good judge

6154076 its just not right that our laws public policy and social climate in florida are so unwelcoming
6154077 and every monday i drive my truck around the neighborhood looking for old wood and stuff in the bulk trash people put out for pickup
6154078 ive stopped garbage trucks on occasion to fish out chunks of rotting wood also a lot of poor people west of miami avenue toss out some of the antiques i use because they consider them to be old hand me downs and worthless
6154079 mechanical wooden automatons that visitors to the rotting arcade might have screwed
6154080 i also create the sets for my movies do drawings make sculptures props installations play music and take photographs
6154081 mom used to screen a super8 reel of the return of dracula during all my birthdays when i was a kid
6154082 it was funny to walk into the living room and watch mom and other adults cowering with blankets tucked under their chins mom was just obsessed with that movie
6154083 im still trying to get all of the stuff here to locust to use on the project
6154084 but theres a beehive inside the mess now and i cant get to all of it
6154085 i remember the guy going into a convenience store and stuffing himself with twinkies to get the liquor off his breath before the cops came
6154086 when i was a kid i used to have these fever dreams during which an energy ball floated into my room and made me sick
6154087 in the movie otto becomes a beekeeper and is conflicted by a giant beehive which is a substitute for the glowing energy ball i used to dream about
6154088 no offense to the underground clubs but we want to do a very audiovisual show where people are sitting down then standing up and going through all these emotions because something is happening and the energy is incredible
6154089 we have the audience and the infrastructure to give these local bands a push
6154090 were interested in fusion and part of our mission is to create bridges between the different expressions of art
6154091 but last week we went to key west and found that our music is now available at any record store
6154092 being on the road sharing with people becoming parents these things have made us mature and that influences the music that we perform and write
6154093 i was an illegal immigrant for 15 years so i know i lived that in cold blood
6154094 when youre an immigrant you come to a country with dreams but very little expectations so when youre doing your art with passion and people from that other culture open their arms for you theres just an amazing warmth that you feel in your heart
6154095 i am convinced another cause of the wide spread violence lies in the abortion act of 1967
6154096 for 41 years weve lived in a state sponsored culture of death that has killed 5 million children and were now surprised that some of the surviving children have turned out violent with no regard for the sanctity of life
6154097 how many children know that their mothers have had an abortion what effect will it have on them knowing that they have been deprived of a brother or sister through abortion if a society holds human life so cheaply is it any surprise that young people will also hold life cheaply and engage in violence
6154098 flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
6154099 much in our modern culture is toxic to the life of human beings
6154100 it is we ourselves who have become monsters for allowing the exploitation of the unborn for our economic and medical gain
6154101 legalised state sponsored culture of death facilitated by some medical professionals scientists politicians and journalists
6154102 reinforce and sustain each other through spreading the general darkening of conscience in society
6154103 proclaim the right to life the most fundamental human right that underpins authentic work for justice and peace
6154104 parliament the british medical association the royal college of nurses brooke advisory centres broadcasters the tabloids and broadsheets
6154105 there appeared to be an a priori suspicion and scepticism about the motives and practices of faith schools in general and catholic schools and the church in particular any hint of evangelisation or catechesis even within our catholic schools is increasingly viewed as intolerable indoctrination and proselytism
6154106 concerned that a breach seems to be growing between the state and the church and the position of faith in general which will harm the ability of both to help the citizens of our county to fulfil their personal and social vocation
6154107 of one thing i am certain this breach will not be mended though compromising the faith and morals of catholic doctrine
6154108 there is nothing heroic or award winning about taking the life of an unborn child as a woman who has suffered an abortion i know that to be true
6154109 giving an abortionist canadas highest honour is dividing the nation contrary to the awards original intent
6154110 a formal long overdue review of the order of canada to prevent this kind of national division from ever happening again
6154111 a simple common sense test in choosing a winner is to ask whether a daycare center or an elementary school could be named after each winner
6154112 imagine the henry morgentaler daycare centre or the henry morgentaler elementary school somehow this does not match with the historic honour of the award
6154113 so let us go forward and work toward building a welcoming home for the unborn and thus a better country she said adding
6154114 were all pretty hung over after practice the night before but still able to hit those morning pushups 105 on the daily
6154115 all of us have day jobs from acrobats to gynecologists whatever we got to do the day of the show were getting ready chillin some of us are working but were also reminding everyone to come out its that last minute promoting day when we post bulletins or send a text on monday people arent going to remember friday is that scramble
6154116 our new production is coming out a lot more organic sounding
6154117 its all recorded live but dont get that twisted like its going to sound like a led zeppelin record its still going to have a lot of electronic and programming feel to it but will have a lot more of an organic swing thats just part of plexs genius as a producer
6154118 it definitely was a conscious decision after a year or two in the game as being somewhat of a national act to change up our style
6154119 for lack of a better word we were feeling like posers after a while up there onstage and not working as hard as we could it was a conscious decision to jump over the cliff and thats what were doing balls to the wall change the sound were getting ready to put a release out probably by the end of this year we really want to take over miami again people want to see us step it up and thats what were going to do
6154120 the group is on imeem facebook and has a youtube page up for mayday tv
6154121 we havent officially launched mayday tv but were thinking about doing a web program to promote the music
6154122 jazid just sneaks up on us we go pick up our gear get dressed and ready for an early sound check
6154123 after that we kick it before we go back onstage in our unofficial greenroom upstairs and thats when the nintendo wii tournament begins
6154124 to blend improvisational electronic elements and turntables with latin funk and dub to create a sound that is unique
6154125 we have two levels artist partners who have an intellectual investment in the space and pay 100 a month and artist associates who pay 150 a year
6154126 we were contacted by artists in italy russia and new york
6154127 we had all these people who became interested in showing in miami once basel came here
6154128 most galleries operate with a group of 20 to 25 artists i wanted to strike a balance so i could continue working on my own art
6154129 its an issue of no longer having too many cooks in the kitchen
6154130 we want to be more of a year round gallery
6154131 the thousands of young lives lost in current times through war displacements hate crimes aids and social abuse
6154132 it worked well for about six months until the lounge became the vip room
6154133 then in november 04 i started a party called world sounds which focused strictly on house music it was a total success and we did it until october 2005 because of some personal issues i stopped doing that party until april of 2007 but since then weve been doing world sounds at the terrace once a month i also play in the main room once a month a huge marathon from 10 p m to 8 a m nonstop but honestly i love it the energy is just incredible
6154134 the average persons never really seen anything like it and thats why people are interested there are so many interesting components the way the guys look with the makeup and the spikes the criminal side of it interests others other people are just into the music itself
6154135 i found it an interesting subculture and through my research i started listening to all the music and did become a fan of some but not all of it
6154136 i went over there and on a personal level got along with a lot of them i think the photos communicated what they wanted to communicate and we saw eye to eye on the final products if i was a superfan i think they would have been a little more standoffish or private the metal media would have a different intention
6154137 we would discuss locations because i didnt know all the special places all over rural norway
6154138 it wasnt like we must go to a mountain and take majestic metal photographs it could be their living room or a majestic fjord somewhere then id let loose and start snapping i like to catch the intimate moments
6154139 were now taking preparation to start commercial operation from next week
6154140 were planning to supply about 60 70 megawatts of power to the national grid from the plant with the start of ramadan our preparation is going on in full swing keeping in mind the holy month
6154141 we have removed all obstacles to her khaledas release but we are yet to overcome the mistrust issue
6154142 gaining trust is the final step for releasing her and trust would pave the way for holding elections with all parties taking part
6154143 we are trying to resolve problems and we are hopeful that she would be released soon
6154144 giving parole is easy for the government bail is a matter of the court
6154145 we are yet to receive the reply to a letter we sent to bnp inviting it to the dialogue and this is delaying talks with the party
6154146 we have plans to hold a dialogue with the media women leaders and youth groups
6154147 we received a letter from the government allocating us 3000 tonnes of rice for dhaka city but we have not yet got any rice
6154148 it may take a day or two to get the rice well then be able to sell it at tk 28 per kg
6154149 if needed we will increase the number of dealers in dhaka city to 1100
6154150 ive sold only 180 kgs till 2 00pm today though i am supposed to sell 750 kgs a day
6154151 we will hold talks with all political parties if necessary to discuss registration and to fix a date for the parliamentary poll some criteria for registration might be relaxed if necessary since we cant provide the parties with adequate time for meeting the criteria
6154152 we have not so far received cases as we expected september 1 is the deadline for voluntary disclosure of ill gotten wealth if there is not enough response we will consider extending the time
6154153 the us doctors said that three of the complications except for the hearing problem are late consequences of the grenade attack
6154154 she can hear normally with the hearing aid in her right ear but she cant withstand it after using it for over two hours
6154155 the doctors in usa told me that her blood pressure complications have also been caused by the attack
6154156 her allergic complications developed from the grenade splinters still in her body splinters contain various chemicals and these can trigger different sorts of complications
6154157 our academic life is disrupted as we have to appear in court every 15 days the government withdrew several cases filed against us but only in name as they brought the charges of other cases under one case
6154158 we asked the vc vice chancellor for help but he said he has nothing to do in this regard
6154159 the detained teachers and students were released after a student movement and the government had promised then that it would not harass teachers and students anymore it has not kept its promise
6154160 however we are yet to get any confirmed information on his whereabouts
6154161 the contradiction of the confessional statements may further complicate the prosecution case and have an impact on the trial
6154162 the previous investigation officers influenced by a vested group tried to divert the investigations to serve their interest
6154163 the confessional statements made earlier were completely forged and false as they were obtained through manipulation and by influencing the accused therefore those have no bearing upon the cases
6154164 the first grenade exploded as the netri sheikh hasina ended her speech and i stood up to walk up to her car
6154165 failing to feed my daughters i hopped them into a madrasa in the solace that they would not at least starve at hostels
6154166 doctors said i would soon go mad if i dont treat my right ear immediately whod look after my kids then
6154167 when august 21 comes back every year journalists like you come here to know how we are getting on what does it bring other than fuelling the old injuries
6154168 i have about 1 500 in my head back abdomen waist arms and legs
6154169 not only that the government did little in brining the culprits behind the attacks to book they also did nothing to help the victims like us
6154170 were happy that the caretaker government has brought the investigation back on track but besides knowing who carried out the attacks we want to know who plotted and financed them and who supplied the grenades
6154171 i feel good i have just proved to the world i am a true champion and with hard work anything is possible
6154172 he bolt is not human eventually hell come back down to earth its ridiculous that guy is the business
6154173 there has been an adverse finding in her a sample against her blonska
6154174 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all
6154175 the gravity of the attack indicates it was not possible to be carried out without backing of any influential group or some most powerful people but we dont see any such findings
6154176 its not possible to reveal the mysteries of an unreachable place ive submitted my investigation report on the area within my reach if i could go further more mysteries of the attack might have been revealed
6154177 but following submission of charge sheets i saw the lawmakers name was not among the 22 accused i think if we could go after that lawmaker at that time we could advance much to trace those who were behind him
6154178 i was at primary stage of the investigation to find out the masterminds and link them with the attack was a huge task but i was not in a position to accomplish the task
6154179 it was an extensively pre planned attack and a huge amount of money was involved its not like that if anyone wants grenades the bombs will automatically be available
6154180 the attack was launched following a massive plan where joj miah was involved in a small part i believe many others were involved like joj miah in different parts of the plan if someone holds anyone of them they will not get the entire picture rather a small part joj miah here represents a small part
6154181 well however assist the family members of joj miah and others who were implicated in the cases falsely if they come forward to file case against those investigators
6154182 the ministry of social affairs and labour is doing everything in its capacity to repatriate the workers
6154183 we then asked the workers to give the embassy their power of attorney so that we can pursue their cases with regards to their salaries and the end of service benefits
6154184 the company had offered to transfer the residencies of some workers to another employer but they refused the workers are disillusioned and just want to go back home
6154185 i want to release a product that uses custom code lgpl v3 code apa
6154186 sex is more in the brain than below the belt for most people the greater the stress level the less sex will be in the relationship

6154194 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us

6154387 it is only by leaving behind local forces capable of containing the taliban that western soldiers will be able one day to get out of the afghan quagmire without giving the impression that they have lost the war
6154388 is whether public opinion will be reinforced in its feeling of the uselessness of the french presence in afghanistan or will the public rally round their soldiers in difficulty and become more favourable to it

6154399 there is plenty of reason to believe that minneapolis will also be dealing with convention related court matters
6154400 the idea is to process cases quickly to avoid backlogs that could keep people arrested in custody for extended periods
6154401 that will likely mean convening court in the evenings and over the weekend
6154402 where others have tried we have succeeded in developing products that serve as safe and delicious alternatives for our very special consumers

6154405 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6154406 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6154407 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6154408 some appeared to have turned to violent extremist groups in the misguided belief that participation in jihad might help atone for previous wrongdoing
6154409 we have noticed that terrorist groups are remarkably tolerant of individuals with serious criminal histories this is the case even when those individuals continue to be involved in very serious non terrorist crimes including drug trafficking assault and even rape
6154410 this feeling is heightened by mainstream uk media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes of muslims by islamic and non islamic media that reports atrocities against muslims worldwide and by the extremist groups themselves who spread the message that muslims are being persecuted to the point that the only course of action is to fight back with violence
6154411 what is different about those who ended up involved in terrorism is that they came into contact with existing extremists who recognised their vulnerabilities and their usefulness to the extremist group
6154412 people do not generally become radicalised simply through passive browsing of extremist websites but many such sites create opportunities for the virtual social interaction that drives radicalisation in the virtual world books dvds pamphlets and music all feature in the experiences of british terrorists but their emotional content eg images of atrocities against muslims is often more important than their factual content
6154413 membership of a terrorist group can provide a sense of meaning and purpose it can lead to enhanced self esteem and the individual can feel a sense of control and influence over their lives some may find psychological security in a belief in future rewards both in paradise and in the collective memory of the movement following suicide operations
6154414 although it is popular to assume that people who become terrorists are passively brainwashed into extremism individuals in fact make active choices to become and remain in extremist activity
6154415 sections of the media our own and allies governments can sometimes make statements that are unwittingly or deliberately provocative non muslim groups eg rightwing extremists can also stoke false fears and resentments which can heighten the perception of threat in muslim communities
6154416 the guolizhuang menu is a broad introduction to the medicinal benefits of eating animal penises and testicles

6154464 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6154465 in general asian americans are not likely to talk about their psychological problems
6154466 community practitioners notice that asian americans are less likely to self disclose their personal problems
6154467 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
6154468 we can only speculate that it may be that a lot of these women are dedicated to family and they live long lives
6154469 without that kind of extended family older women may be more likely to commit suicide
6154470 although we dont have good statistics yet we believe that many asian american students are prone to feeling depressed over a lack of achievement
6154471 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
6154472 search engines today primarily match words in a search to words on a web page we can solve these problems by working to understand the intent behind each search and the concepts and meaning embedded in a web page doing so we can innovate in the quality of the search results in the flexibility with which searchers can phrase their queries and in the search user experience

6154486 a fool is a terrible thing to have around but a fool with energy is a nightmare
6154487 until that issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6154488 to me the market has now recognized that oil services stocks and equipment stocks sold off more than they should have
6154489 now they are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the is on a weekly basis
6154490 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power

6154494 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia
6154495 leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program

6154505 an animation studio of this size and magnitude in sudbury is no mickey mouse announcement
6154506 since 2003 we have indicated our commitment to building a strong sudbury by supporting new programs facilities and projects through nohfc grants through these types of initiatives the mcguinty government is fulfilling its promise to help build a stronger more diversified northern ontario
6154507 its going to create another economic engine for our community i see this as a complete win for everyone involved
6154508 today thanks to the mcguinty government and the nohfc cambrian college will be able to teach modern animation techniques in a technologically advanced setting
6154509 the demand for animation specialists is growing across sectors ranging from entertainment and the arts to industry and healthcare this funding will position us to respond to the needs of these sectors as well as to the needs of aspiring animators we applaud the mcguinty government for its continued focus on the north and the needs of northerners
6154510 were absolutely thrilled because this gives us an opportunity to drive the economy to support the fledgling industry of the filmmaking industry right here in sudbury
6154511 i grew up in the north and the trend when i was growing up was worse than it has been in the past and that is an out migration of youth
6154512 you grew up in the north your biggest goal was to get the hell out of the north
6154513 we used to just think about animation as being something that is for entertainment mining health care manufacturing all of these different areas are using animation for training
6154514 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6154515 nearby were pools of blood watches tattered clothes and a mobile telephone still ringing
6154516 the blast pulverised the bombers body into pieces with bits of his limbs strewn metres away
6154517 the hardcore of hardliners in the group in favour of suicide bombings are in charge of the operations on the ground
6154518 there is no easy solution to stop a suicide bomber the only way is to continue to besiege the terrorist strongholds and fight them there it is a race against time
6154519 while we welcome and encourage spirited public debate about appropriate standards of behavior we do not support policies that would have the effect of encouraging or making it more likely that younger citizens would use alcohol or drugs
6154520 emory university has decided not to join the amethyst initiative emory will continue its long standing commitment to educate students about the dangers of abusing alcohol and other drugs
6154521 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6154522 the amethyst initiative is not calling for a lower drinking age its not calling for an 18 year old drinking age
6154523 its a group of leaders in higher education are speaking out on an issue they know a lot about
6154524 you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is whats happening to their mortgages whats happening to their gas and electricity bills whats happening to oil prices and petrol prices at the pumps
6154525 these are the issues they want us to address and look at you will see us dealing with some of these issues when we come back in september
6154526 no one makes advance announcements on things like that we are concentrating on economic issues
6154527 was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written
6154528 these are the debates all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in
6154529 support for the games and engagement with china is not at the expense of human rights it is integral to their promotion
6154530 several hundred individuals known to be involved in or closely associated with violent extremist activity
6154531 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6154532 are a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6154533 theres no reason to cap charters make sure that they can prove that they are going to do a good job ask them report as much information as you need but if students are wanting to attend a public charter school why not give them that opportunity

6154537 ive always been intrigued by those people who are out there who you have never heard of who have written a million shows and who still believe in it musical theatre with all their heart and soul
6154538 but i never knew what kind of context to put him in until 9 11
6154539 i dont know why 9 11 made me think about everything in a different way but as an actor i remember auditioning for things back then things that were getting cancelled
6154540 i thought what if somebodys big break was about to happen and for some reason because of 9 11 the show is cancelled and that was sort of the stepping off point for the musical then i had to fill in the rest of his career
6154541 we kind of have the same responses to a lot of things
6154542 a smart look at politics pop culture and all the days top stories
6154543 la t alle politischen gefangenen auch den panchen lama frei
6154544 china hat die versprechen nicht gehalten die es bei der zuerkennung der olympischen spiele gab
6154545 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6154546 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6154547 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6154548 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6154549 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6154550 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6154551 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6154552 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6154553 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6154554 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6154555 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6154556 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6154557 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6154558 someone who finds its likely that their name has been placed on a government watch list will get their day in court
6154559 are you gonna set an agenda of change or one of compromise of what the republican minority is gonna allow you to do in the congress
6154560 even if we do well theres still gonna be almost half the country that votes for somebody else so one of the things that we have to understand is that theres nothing wrong with compromise as long as you understand what your core principles are and my core principles are that im fighting for ordinary americans to make sure that they can live out their american dream and i am fighting to make sure that our values and ideals enshrined in our constitution and our declaration of independence are upheld
6154561 winning elections and governing in america is a complex undertaking and it takes some recognition that most of the country is more moderate
6154562 more people identify themselves as moderates than either liberal or conservative i think hes a moderate but a liberal moderate and hes not running as an ideologue which i think is important i do think though he has to sharpen his message so that those moderates are comfortable with his values
6154563 hes changed the emphasis in which he talks about things hes in for a hard fight and there are large swatches of the country that are waiting to see if hes pretty close to them in terms of values this hasnt been easy for democrats to do theres a reason democrats have lost seven out of the last 10 elections for president with obama youve seen an emphasis on things like faith based initiatives which have always been part of his platform but wasnt a major emphasis in the primary campaign
6154564 theres always been this tension about whether you run a populist campaign geared towards middle class voters their needs their angers
6154565 or do you run a moderate dlc democratic leadership council model the truth is weve come out of this hybrid of the two
6154566 he has to show people who dont live in seattle or new york city that hes real
6154567 campaigns arent about issues theyre about emotions raw emotions and he has to spend a lot of time speaking to people in the middle of america he has to broaden his voice
6154568 i remind a lot of democrats who didnt vote for al gore because he wasnt liberal enough that we got george bush
6154569 how did that help the liberal cause al gore would not have gotten us into iraq and he wouldnt have appointed supreme court justices like john alito and john roberts i am not one of those who sits back and says youre either 100 percent with us or youre against us it doesnt make sense obama might be something you might not like to win in pennsylvania or somewhere else governing is more important than purity youve got to keep your ideals but you have to be a realist
6154570 you ran great guns in the campaign it was an insurgency boy a sight to see and then you drove to the middle of the road the moment after you took the oath just the middle of the road nothing but a long line painted yellow i wanted to retire five years ago but i waited for a democrat i wanted a democrat hmmph and instead i got you
6154571 if you look at where the american people are were where the american people are on issue after issue after issue
6154572 whether its getting responsibly out of iraq or forming an energy independence plan i think sen obamas where the american public is
6154573 democrats are two three times more energized about their nominee than republicans are about theirs the great thing is that the base wants change and independents in this country want change as a matter of fact moderate republicans want change i think were fortunate that we have a message that carries across all of those platforms
6154574 threatens to rapidly accelerate new delhis arms race with pakistan a rivalry made all the more precarious by the resignation on tuesday of the pakistani president pervez musharraf
6154575 this deal was foolish when pakistan was relatively stable with mr musharraf gone an arms race on the subcontinent would likely be more difficult to control
6154576 can say yes to nuclear trade with india if two simple conditions are met
6154577 first india must sign the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty a step already taken by 178 other countries and every member state of the nuclear suppliers group
6154578 second india must agree to halt production of nuclear material for weapons
6154579 would prove to the international community that opening up nuclear commerce would not assist either directly or indirectly its nuclear weapons program
6154580 countries such as iran and north korea would certainly use the precedent to their advantage

6154586 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
6154587 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
6154588 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
6154589 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6154590 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6154591 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6154592 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6154593 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6154594 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie

6154600 americas record in expanding broadband communication is so poor that it should be viewed as an outrage by every consumer and businessperson in the country
6154601 young people are participating more than they did four years ago but they still have tremendous potential to do so much more
6154602 common ownership of the baa airports is identified in our provisional findings as a feature that may prevent restrict or distort competition as it prevents rivalry between airports that could potentially compete with one another we consider that divestiture will be an effective remedy for this feature as it replaces common ownership with separate ownership where each separate owner has incentives to compete to gain the business of customers
6154603 we believe it will appeal to business users who travel internationally but less so to consumers given its likely high price
6154604 the public can look forward to more and more usable information as time goes on
6154605 we now know that quality reporting of data leads to better quality

6154622 we can expect with high probability this year will be cooler than the previous five years
6154623 definitely the la nina should have had an effect how much we cannot say
6154624 up to july 2008 this year has been cooler than the previous five years at least it still looks like its warmer than average
6154625 of course at the beginning of the year there was la nina and that would have had the effect of suppressing temperatures somewhat as well
6154626 but actually la nina is showing signs of moving towards a more neutral state

6154639 im glad theyre starting their review although i do think they need to act faster to review all of the sites i expressed concerns last week about the future of the tssa i think for example when you have a site like this thats inherently dangerous the reason you have a regulator is to ensure its safe and inspecting once every three years to me does not seem adequate
6154640 yes something didnt work theres no doubt about that what im saying is that something happened which obviously should not have happened lets figure out exactly what went wrong before we act precipitously
6154641 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6154642 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6154643 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6154644 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6154645 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6154646 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated

6154660 the bilateral relationship between switzerland the usa the situation has not improved over the last two years
6154661 not done much to align the us swiss interest and to strengthen the swiss position as partner of choice

6154699 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6154700 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6154701 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6154702 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent

6154728 i think it reconfirms that mr chr tien and the liberals have always pursued a policy in this area calculated to their own personal financial interests and those of rich and powerful friends
6154729 its no mistake that mr chr tien was calculating his retirement income in his relations in this area it was a few weeks after he left the premiership that he was being signed on as a consultant to multinational companies with commercial interests in this area

6154731 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
6154732 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
6154733 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
6154734 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years

6154741 ive always been intrigued by those people who are out there who you have never heard of who have written a million shows and who still believe in it musical theatre with all their heart and soul
6154742 but i never knew what kind of context to put him in until 9 11
6154743 i dont know why 9 11 made me think about everything in a different way but as an actor i remember auditioning for things back then things that were getting cancelled
6154744 i thought what if somebodys big break was about to happen and for some reason because of 9 11 the show is cancelled and that was sort of the stepping off point for the musical then i had to fill in the rest of his career
6154745 we kind of have the same responses to a lot of things

6154750 this is 1 of 4 models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class
6154751 this is a huge change from just 5 years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare

6154757 mir ist zum heulen zumute ich bin ziemlich entt uscht warum habe ich nicht wenigstens die 9 5 f hrung im letzten satz nach hause gebracht das ist sehr schade dass es nicht geklappt hat ich war wohl einfach zu hektisch wollte schnell die wichtigen punkte machen bei den letzten b llen war ich einfach zu ungeduldig bisher hatte ich eigentlich eine ganz gute bilanz gegen li qiangbing selbst wenn wir uns von fr her aus china kennen gerade nun bei olympia eine niederlage einzustecken das ist ganz schlimm
6154758 jetzt hatten wir die gew nschten f hrungen und es ist uns trotzdem nicht gelungen sie zu halten auch heute haben wir die gegnerin wieder schlicht und einfach spielen lassen es muss jetzt die zeit sein das geschehen von peking gr ndlich zu analysieren wir haben in der vorbereitung nichts anderes gemacht als die herren aber die stehen nun weitaus besser da irgendwie k nnen wir da nicht viel richtig gemacht haben an ein aufstecken oder aufgeben ist aber nicht zu denken bei den europameisterschaften im oktober in st petersburg wollen wir uns wieder besser und in gewohnter st rke pr sentieren
6154759 das ist eine hohe h rde bei der em letztes jahr in belgrad habe ich noch 0 4 verloren das will ich nicht noch einmal ich kann ja befreit aufspielen und will das match m glichst eng gestalten und lange offen halten

6154765 the reality of the software business today is that if you find something that can make you ridiculously rich then thats something microsoft is going to want to take from you
6154766 all we can do is meet with them and try to see what theyre going to do to us when they feel like doing it if they want to kill you theyll kill you
6154767 these cases can be extraordinarily dangerous if they make it to a jury it has been my experience that if a case survives summary judgment and makes it to a jury the chance of success for the woman plaintiff are very high accordingly we are very proactive and defend these cases quite aggressively in order to ensure that they do not make it to trial

6154774 non discuto larte ma se poi i miei fedeli parlano di porcherie piazzate sulla pubblica via sono costretto a intervenire
6154775 it became much more important to make all these choices as a witting conscious consumer of life
6154776 and deeper than that there was a sense that if you did follow a traditional route
6154777 now it means choosing your breast size it might mean choosing the way your nose looks almost every discrete element of our lives now can be looked at as a consumer choice
6154778 we accepted naively a bill of goods about how one forges an identity and happiness in life and it doesnt come in a vacuum it comes in a community with the help of others

6154785 experts estimate that if we keep on the current course 75 percent of americans will be overweight or obese by 2015
6154786 but hes always been a good player you have to get opportunities in the league and sometimes when you dont you get stereotyped i think thats what happened to j t
6154787 this isnt a guy out of control by any means j t just plays with a lot of competitive fire
6154788 the cultures of two ends of that pipeline are very different
6154789 with this commitment we feel were in position to recognize the findings and merge them into our efforts
6154790 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill up front
6154791 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect up front than to go after someone on the back end
6154792 its reasonable to go to an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
6154793 the timing seemed right because were in these times where people dont necessarily know if their jobs going to be there tomorrow and when a lot of people dont necessarily like their jobs they have now
6154794 why dont you go out there and revisit those kinds of jobs that actually made america great those great working class blue collar jobs thats what these are it was great to get these contestants out of that cubicle that conceptual life were in and get out there and get some real raw experience in a place with high stakes and high rewards
6154795 in the old days it was the action heroes movie stars who were our heroes then for a really weird little while politicians and bankers and people that made a lot of money were our heroes
6154796 since they took all of our money with them and left us broke were standing around going who are our heroes today i think whats happened is were starting to look within ourselves were trying to remind ourselves what made america great it was the fact that we did stuff with our hands we created stuff we worked we didnt just basically think it and outsource it i think thats changing
6154797 now we have strong female characters capable of standing on their own
6154798 people who are published will tell you its because of who they met here
6154799 its a close knit supportive chapter theyre my family and coming to the conference is a great way to get your work in front of acquiring publishers
6154800 agents and editors want to know who is your heroine
6154801 if you have to repeat your pitch five or six times to different people its going to get honed
6154802 the amount of promotion you can expect from a good house if youre lucky is four to six weeks after launch
6154803 youre going to be disappointed unless you are proactive and take your future into your own hands
6154804 when my editor told me you write like jane austen my daughters knew what it meant to me
6154805 i was tired of getting rejections because i didnt know my craft
6154806 the romance writers of america gave me what i consider the equivalent of a degree in fiction writing
6154807 i have been in love with christ since i was 4
6154808 theres no tlp token lost person who is evangelized and saved in the last act my characters are christians before the books start they stumble like we all do
6154809 a sex scene must be emotionally true to character and it has to make the conflict worse
6154810 do you practice your love scenes before you write them
6154811 the way that is going to prevent that is to take the children out of the home
6154812 wouldnt you like them to be there for each other if you couldnt be
6154813 she never got anything other than we want the children
6154814 she is going to do everything she can to see this thing through and be reunited with her daughter again
6154815 me alegro mucho de estar en murcia porque es una gran ciudad y un gran equipo para m

6154819 es un jugador que nos va a venir muy bien y quiz s en los ltimos a os nos haya faltado un jugador con sus caracter sticas y condiciones

6154822 she said the women in her day didnt think about breastfeeding
6154823 two or three generations ago they didnt even have the information in front of them to the benefits of breastfeeding
6154824 now they do and it seems more of a simple choice for them to say oh yes i am going to breastfeed
6154825 its status in many communities to bottle feed your baby
6154826 but we have to turn around and tell them what would you do in your home country
6154827 its something i truly believe and not having the support makes it challenging
6154828 when i speak to my family theyll ask me oh are you still breastfeeding her
6154829 they felt it was weird especially if its a boy
6154830 but its a natural kind of thing the baby is not going to look at you as a sexual object whether its a boy or a girl
6154831 within a decade you saw women going to the hospital having their babies a lot of medical personnel involved and science involved
6154832 consequently infant feeding practices went more in the realm of the doctor and not the woman and her community and her mother
6154833 there was a point where i wanted to give up but i knew i had decided i wanted to do it so i decided to start back

6154835 it is my hope that fidelity will follow the industry trend and promptly repurchase these securities
6154836 they think oh its a scooter theyre all just the same
6154837 but its not its just like cars every car is going to fit a different person a little bit
6154838 my et4 handled much better for me once i put the lower seat on
6154839 the issue comes between the handlebar and where your front sits
6154840 because when you sit down your knee can get in the way of steering
6154841 it doesnt have that refined italian sports car look its more of a kind of tough off road rugged look
6154842 if you get into some bumpy roads i think you want some weight so you dont go flying off the road
6154843 but if the bike is too heavy for the rider to push then its just plain too heavy
6154844 many shops dont even bother to sell 50cc bikes while a few of our members have 50cc scooters most prefer 150cc or above for navigating the hills
6154845 you need to have the power to get up and go and get out of the way
6154846 for a lot of people it kind of ruins the buying process
6154847 if you have a desire to understand the physics of the invisible realm and improve your knowledge about time space and matter then get ready to experience a paradigm shift into a bigger and better view of our awesome god

6154853 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
6154854 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that
6154855 you come to do a burglary on a bus you do the burglary you take your guns and get back on the bus and go home
6154856 has been re engineered to offer more instant control with an eight way input taking place of the previous four

6154858 look at what the celestials did to lord amherst there he was on the very threshold of pekin peking with a shipload of presents and the emperor wouldnt so much as receive him
6154859 british rule in india could not be sustained without opium that is all there is to it and let us not pretend otherwise you are no doubt aware that in some years the companys annual gains from opium are almost equal to the entire revenue of your own country the united states and if we reflect on the benefits that british rule has conferred upon india does it not follow that opium is the lands greatest blessing does it not follow that it is our god given duty to confer these benefits upon others
6154860 i believe these accusations are false we as a family are looking forward to the day all of these charges are dropped and his name is cleared
6154861 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6154862 my big things are closed toed shoes no flip flops
6154863 probably from 2007 to 2008 its even more than that
6154864 because the scooters are not fast enough to get you into trouble physically and theyre not slow enough to get passed all the time so theyre kind of in this sweet spot where they just keep up with traffic which is the safest place to be
6154865 we even have a prominent local surgeon who rides between all the hospitals for emergency surgeries on a scooter
6154866 i always tell people your head is a lot softer than the concrete on the ground
6154867 my big things are closed toed shoes no flip flops
6154868 there are ways to gear up and still look good of course
6154869 if im wearing a skirt or a dress that day i just throw a pair of jeans on underneath for the ride to work and take them off when i arrive
6154870 when you fold it in half it becomes 3 feet
6154871 advertising whats under there and how expensive it was is probably not the best idea
6154872 all you can do is be the person that is diligent about it and doesnt leave it unlocked
6154873 its going to take a lot more than that to fix your bike the first time somebody knocks it over
6154874 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6154875 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6154876 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6154877 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6154878 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6154879 as we look to expand the ea sports brand and captivate sports fans from around the world with rich new interactive experiences it was obvious that the renaissance were seeing in the sport of tennis provides us with a big opportunity
6154880 our new tennis franchise coming first to the wii will put fans right into the action and provide the excitement tension and drama that true champions feel in legendary matches like the classic from wimbledon just last month
6154881 by using the product instead of the on screen keyboard users will be able to enjoy text chat communication more easily and comfortably in their hands just as they would use familiar portable communication devices it supports text chat in playstation home as well and enables users to enjoy interactivity playing on line titles and enjoying entertainment content more smoothly

6154897 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6154898 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
6154899 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
6154900 in that time you learn a lot about safety and side effects and how to use it
6154901 those getting it early should be the ones who really want it and willing to accept the risk
6154902 you can only study a vaccine for so long before you license and use it in a population where it has enormous value
6154903 our hope and belief is that this is a remarkable vaccine that will have huge impact on women
6154904 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
6154905 im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
6154906 this initiative was seen as a good use of resources that fits with the governments health priorities and political priorities
6154907 if we do this quickly and badly we could cause more deaths
6154908 i chose to get vaccinated because my dreams dont include cervical cancer
6154909 to make sure they are providing accurate information in accordance with fda approved labeling and to make sure dissemination of information is always appropriate
6154910 you the female students sitting in your class your sorority sisters your teammates and your best girlfriends could all be at risk
6154911 is a very small organization and we dont have funds

6154915 the immunity of gardasil will not last that is dangerous to assume
6154916 well worry about whether boosters are needed down the road
6154917 gardasil continues to be safe and effective and its benefits continue to outweigh its risks

6154929 kids are just getting overweight at a much younger age were noticing that infants are off the chart for height and weight
6154930 it is a drastic change from what weve seen in the last 25 years and its affecting younger and younger children
6154931 people dont realize it but even if preschool age kids can have high blood pressure they can have type 2 diabetes
6154932 this is very worrisome talking to kids about weight too early can lead to eating disorders later in life

6154971 we do know from other studies that individuals who are in shorter term relationships are more likely to use a condom than individuals in longer term relationships
6154972 its possible that youth between the ages of 18 and 19 year olds are in longer term relationships and therefore they perceive their risk for sexually transmitted disease infection to be lower and so unfortunately theyre not using a condom

6154990 lutz production volt has a cd between 28 and 29 and battery extreme cold performance is good
6154991 cant wait to see the government pull its act together on this
6154992 lutz explained that the concept volt would have only gotten 35 miles of range based on its wind tunnel performance
6154993 we were way off costing this car it would have been around 50k we are going to make it more affordable which means losing alot of the distinct features but increase efficiency as well it should allow us to be in the mid 30s
6154994 the difference of 0 02 and 0 03 is small this is like measuring a turd with a micrometer
6154995 in terms of the battery testing so far he said
6154996 there has been a constant military campaign that clearly is very difficult to achieve largely because the region is mountainous and the local population is either indifferent or sympathetic to the extremists
6154997 the algerian authorities are facing a major problem in terms of conceiving a way of dealing with this
6154998 the government is not openly dictatorial but it is incompetent and unresponsive
6154999 unflinchingly fight terrorism with a strong determination until its total elimination in our country
6155000 at the same time algeria will not deviate from the path of national reconciliation which has already given major progress in the consolidation of security across the national territory

6155005 when amateurs outperform professionals there is something wrong with that profession if ordinary people with no medical training could perform surgery in their kitchens with steak knives and get results that were better than those of surgeons in hospital operating rooms the whole medical profession would be discredited yet it is common for ordinary parents with no training in education to homeschool their children and consistently produce better academic results than those of children educated by teachers with masters degrees and in schools spending upwards of 10 000 a year per student which is to say more than a million dollars to educate ten kids from k through 12 nevertheless we continue to take seriously the pretensions of educators who fail to educate but who put on airs of having professional expertise beyond the understanding of mere parents
6155006 one of the most widespread and dramatic examples of amateurs outperforming professionals has been in economies that have had central planning directed by highly educated people advised by experts and having at their disposal vast amounts of statistical data not available and probably not understandable by ordinary citizens great things were expected from centrally planned economies their early failings were brushed aside as the growing pains of a new society but when centrally planned economies lagged behind free market economies for decade after decade eventually even socialist and communist governments began to free their economies from many if not most of the government controls under central planning almost invariably these economies then took off with much higher economic growth rates china and india being the most prominent examples but look at the implications of the failure of central planning and the success of letting the market that is millions of people who are nowhere close to being experts make the decisions as to what is to be produced and by whom how can it be that people with postgraduate degrees people backed by the power of government and drawing on experts of all sorts failed to do as well as masses of people of the sort routinely disdained by intellectuals what could be the reason and does that reason apply in other contexts besides the economy

6155015 this is by far the most exciting cast we have in over 13 years of shooting live action movies for command amp conquer
6155016 the caliber of the performances we received both individually and collectively have really raised the storytelling bar for the franchise we are really excited that we will be delivering such a high quality production that is on par with movies and television shows
6155017 i wasnt sure what to expect when i came in to work on a video game
6155018 what i realized is red alert 3 is not just a video game its absolutely an interactive movie this is where the people at home get to move the story forward and where seeing the plot thicken is a reward for a job well done and thats really cool
6155019 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques
6155020 to be in a groundbreaking game like red alert 3 where we are using full on shooting of live actors and to be with jonathan pryce tim curry and peter stormare it was a great opportunity for a character actor like me to have some fun
6155021 the parking lot was already pretty full by the time the clerk in the store called for officers
6155022 we dont know know what led up to the shooting or the disagreement
6155023 almost two thirds of the wage gap is because of reasons unexplained and one third is for reasons explained

6155026 it is possible we may be about to see one of those periodic shifts in fashion and manners in which modern man no longer wants his women quite so topless
6155027 social enterprise can be a route to fulfilling employment better incomes and greater independence and has the power to transform our country for the better
6155028 significantly for bame women it can enhance the role they play in their local communities we want to develop practical measures for increasing the representation of bame women in their communities and we recognise the multiple benefits from encouraging more of them to enter social enterprise
6155029 social enterprises draw on a diverse range of talent that delivers innovative approaches to some of the most challenging social problems
6155030 bame women can have a better understanding of the issues facing their communities than anyone else so supporting them in particular has great potential to help improve those communities this report is an important contribution to the governments drive to encourage and support more people who want to become social entrepreneurs
6155031 encouraging enterprising women from bame communities to connect with social enterprise should be an absolute priority as it will benefit not only those communities but the uk economy as a whole
6155032 social enterprise promotes economic growth and provides meaningful employment across the uk and is empowering and effective among communities that have been traditionally excluded from mainstream business
6155033 nabi kalian telah mengajarkan kepada kalian segala sesuatu sampai pun perkara adab buang hajat
6155034 ya allah sesungguhnya aku berlindung kepada mu dari syaitan laki laki dan syaitan perempuan
6155035 merupakan kaidah yang berkesinambungan dalam syariat di mana tangan kaki kanan didahulukan dalam melakukan perkara yang mulia seperti memakai pakaian celana sandal masuk masjid bersiwak bercelak menggunting kuku mencukur kumis menyisir rambut mencabut bulu ketiak mencukur rambut salam ketika selesai shalat mencuci anggota wudhu keluar dari wc makan minum berjabat tangan menyentuh hajar aswad dan selainnya dari perkara yang semisal di atas semua itu disenangi untuk memulai dengan bagian kanan adapun lawan dari perkara di atas seperti masuk wc keluar dari masjid istinja melepas pakaian celana sandal dan yang semisalnya disenangi untuk memulai dengan tangan kaki kiri
6155036 suatu hari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam pernah memboncengkan aku di belakang beliau lalu beliau membisikkan kepadaku satu pembicaraan yang aku tidak akan memberitahukannya kepada seorangpun selama lamanya adalah beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam menyenangi menjadikan tempat yang tinggi berupa bangunan atau selainnya dan kebun kurma sebagai tempat berlindung menutup diri ketika buang hajat
6155037 hadits ini menunjukkan disenanginya menutup diri ketika seseorang sedang buang hajat dengan apa saja yang dapat mencegah menghalangi pandangan orang terhadapnya ketika itu dan dimungkinkan buang hajat beliau di kebun kurma bukan pada saat kurma itu berbuah
6155038 kabar yang pasti dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam bahwasanya bila ingin buang hajat beliau pergi ke tempat yang jauh dari penglihatan manusia namun bila sekedar buang air kecil beliau tidak menjauh dari mereka
6155039 aku pernah keluar bersama rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam ke tempat buang hajat kebiasaan beliau ketika buang hajat adalah pergi menjauh dari manusia
6155040 beliau shallallahu alaihi wasallam apabila ingin buang hajat dalam safarnya pergi hingga tersembunyi dari pandangan para shahabatnya dan terkadang beliau menjauh sampai 2 mil beliau menutup dirinya ketika buang hajat terkadang dengan berlindung di balik tempat tinggi terkadang di balik kebun kurma dan terkadang dengan pepohonan yang tumbuh di lembah
6155041 aku pernah berjalan jalan bersama nabi shallallahu alaihi wasallam beliau lalu mendatangi tempat pembuangan sampah yang terletak di belakang tembok beliau berdiri di situ sebagaimana salah seorang dari kalian berdiri lalu beliau buang air kecil aku pun menyingkir dari beliau namun beliau memberi isyarat kepadaku maka aku pun mendatanginya aku berdiri di belakang beliau hingga beliau selesai dari hajatnya
6155042 ini menunjukkan beliau tidak menjauh dari hudzaifah ketika buang air kecil
6155043 kencing lebih ringan daripada buang air besar karena buang air besar butuh untuk lebih membuka aurat dan bau yang ditimbulkan lebih menusuk sementara tujuan menjauh dari manusia adalah untuk menutup diri dari penglihatan mereka dan ini terpenuhi dengan membentangkan pakaian dan mendekat dengan sesuatu yang dapat menutupi
6155044 sesuatu yang di dalamnya tertera nama allah subhanahu wa taala harus dijaga dari tempat tempat yang jelek kotor dan ini tidak khusus berupa cincin saja namun mencakup semua benda yang dipakai yang padanya ada dzikrullah
6155045 dibenci untuk membawa sesuatu yang padanya ada dzikrullah tanpa ada keperluan
6155046 apabila kalian mendatangi tempat buang air maka janganlah kalian menghadap ke arah kiblat ketika buang air besar ataupun kencing dan jangan pula membelakangi kiblat akan tetapi menghadaplah ke arah timur atau ke arah barat1
6155047 aku pernah menaiki rumah hafshah2 karena suatu keperluan maka ketika itu aku melihat rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wasallam buang hajat menghadap ke arah syam dan membelakangi ka bah
6155048 sungguh beliau melarang kami untuk membelakangi dan menghadap kiblat dengan kemaluan kemaluan kami apabila kami buang air kemudian aku melihat beliau kencing menghadap kiblat setahun sebelum meninggalnya
6155049 sebagian ahlul ilmi menyenangi bagi orang yang kencing dalam keadaan duduk untuk menjauh dari manusia dan mereka memandang tidak apa apa kencing di dekat orang lain bila dilakukan dengan berdiri karena kencing dalam keadaan berdiri lebih menjaga dubur dan lebih selamat dari percikan najis pendapat seperti ini diriwayatkan dari umar

6155055 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6155056 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6155057 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6155058 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy

6155064 the defense department has spent billions to fix its antiquated financial systems but still has no idea where its money goes
6155065 in 2000 defenses inspector general told congress that his auditors stopped counting after finding 2 3 trillion in unsupported entries
6155066 trillions for military technology how the pentagon innovates and why it costs so much
6155067 why it takes decades to get them into production even as innovation in the civilian economy becomes ever more frenetic and why some of those weapons dont work very well despite expenditures of many billions of dollars
6155068 the internal politics of the armed services make weapons acquisition almost unmanageable

6155075 its late its dark and you are on your own the city lights are in the distant even though they look close they are so out of reach you have to get home but the you know that its not going to be easy the night brings creatures to mind are they real inner demons perhaps is that noise just litter blowing in the bitter wind or was it something with big teeth dragging something in the darkest shades of the night
6155076 the cheerleaders who were brought from europe by the sponsors tensports and idea mobile phone and put into action for the first match were dropped for the second as their actions dont go well in dambulla a world heritage site

6155083 even if there was an athlete that wanted to speak out on issues of human rights he might be silenced by whatever ioc official is mediating that press event
6155084 massive suppression of any voice that the government doesnt want heard
6155085 the chinese governments own voluntary pledges to improve human rights allow public protests and guarantee complete freedom to report made meeting these self set human rights benchmarks one of the tests for a successful olympics
6155086 that is a test that both beijing and the ioc have failed
6155087 may leave in place permanent technological surveillance and monitoring networks that make doing human rights work even more dangerous and difficult for chinese citizens
6155088 the olympics related rights violations well documented in china forced evictions abuse of migrant workers repression of civil society will almost certainly be replayed in russia
6155089 but it could get even uglier in russia journalists are not only harassed they are sometimes murdered
6155090 silent diplomacy is fine but it has to be matched by change on the ground
6155091 if theres no evidence of change you have to back that up with public pressure
6155092 were a sports organization we stay clearly within our role which is to bring sport to host countries
6155093 were not an organization that is best placed or has the capacity to deal with human rights issues
6155094 tibet is part of china the whole world knows that
6155095 the goal for the chinese government is to promote nationalism further
6155096 but ironically the olympic games exposed more social crises than ever like the tibet issue to the chinese people
6155097 in the end they pretty much defined the terms in which the media was going to operate

6155104 ive been seeing you here almost every weekend for the last couple months
6155105 ah no maam thats every weekend i wouldnt miss one of your shows
6155106 ive seen you perform all four of your shows twenty six times so far
6155107 not to sound rude but i only come to see you dance
6155108 no thank you i dont accept drinks from customers they sometimes get the idea you owe them something if you do
6155109 sure if you think the walkin talkin bulldozer over there will let me stay long enough
6155110 its okay as long as youre with one of us hold on a second hey jake would you mind asking connie to make me a drink and one for my friend
6155111 your body language ive been watching you squirm around in your chair two nights a week for three months now thats some powerful body language if you ask me
6155112 just watching you wiggling around has been turning me on for weeks
6155113 no its not funny i wasnt laughing at you i was laughing at myself
6155114 ive been coming here every night you dance because i think youre the sexiest creature ever put on this planet and you say
6155115 ive been trying to build up enough nerve to come over here and talk to you for weeks
6155116 wait a second i think we need to start this conversation over apparently ive missed a major portion of it or is this the part where i wake up and find it was all just a dream
6155117 why would you be turned on by me you have dozens of rich handsome men in this place every week ready to cream their dockers over you you could have your choice of any one of them in a heartbeat
6155118 exactly and thats why i never date any of them or any other men for that matter theyre all in lust not in love
6155119 lets just say i prefer the gentle touch of a pretty lady to the groping of a man
6155120 the way you watch me dance and the way you keep staring at my breasts right now tells me you are
6155121 well im not a switch hitter if that answers your question
6155122 and as much as i hate to say this if youd close your kimono up a bit it would make it a lot easier for me to hold a conversation
6155123 yeah i cant keep my eyes off of it and it makes it difficult if not impossible to keep my mind on anything else
6155124 damn girl dont do that youre giving me cold chills
6155125 easy you squirm a lot more when im doing that routine ill bet your panties are soaked by the end of that dance
6155126 performance would be like i was glad she wasnt there to see the squirming
6155127 you like not what you thought id be wearing is it
6155128 yes i like it and no it isnt exactly what i had expected
6155129 just think about this until we get to my place under this little dress im wearing your lacy lingerie
6155130 im sorry dont answer thats none of my business i was just curious
6155131 including the performance im going to do for you tonight let me see thatll be a grand total of one
6155132 im particular about who i do private performances for besides i wanna watch you squirm some more and believe me by the time im done dancing for you tonight i intend to have you squirming around like a drop of water on a red hot griddle
6155133 i cant wait maybe ill make you do a little squirming too
6155134 wow i knew exotic dancers got paid some pretty good money
6155135 i dont get paid anything for my dancing i own magic dancer
6155136 i get a real charge outta knowing i can still turn the guys on just by getting up there and strutting my stuff
6155137 not really the way i see it im still young twenty seven isnt a bad age to be and already own one of the nicer clubs in town i still have a fairly decent body the guys seem to enjoy my routines and it also means i dont have to pay another dancer to take my place on the stage the dancing helps to keep me in good physical shape another thing exotic dancing is quickly becoming a lost art sure theres a lot of gals out there shaking their cute little asses and boobs in everybodys face but theyre not really dancers theyre strippers thats a completely different animal i feel im doing my little part to preserve a dying art form
6155138 besides i love to watch those horny old bastards sitting out there with their hands in their laps and their wallets on the table drooling over something they know good and well they cant have
6155139 like you yes but you no sweet thing you havent seen wicked yet
6155140 come on lets go inside i wanna give you the grand tour of my humble little abode
6155141 yeah its way too big for me i keep most of the house closed down because i dont need all that space and i damn sure dont wanna be trying to keep it all clean
6155142 its some kind of tax thingy my accountant insists on some sort of tax shelter i dont understand all that stuff so i listen to her and do what she suggests let me take you out back and show you my pride and joy of the whole place its the room i spend most of my off time in other than my bedroom of course
6155143 this is where i come to keep my tan nice and even
6155144 i do a lot of nude sunbathing down here at any hour of the day or night
6155145 maybe i could join you for some fun in the sun sometime
6155146 i dont know it just seemed like the thing to do at the moment
6155147 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6155148 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6155149 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6155150 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6155151 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6155152 all women whether they wish to admit it or not would like to get men into a tied up situation

6155164 por comprar algo legal no pod a perder este caso
6155165 s est muy pr ximo el partido ya el viernes as que hay que trabajar fuerte pensando ya en este partido y tratar de mejorar en las cosas que se hicieron mal
6155166 claro es importante sacar el resultado trabajar y hacer un buen partido
6155167 no la verdad no s nada o s muy poco pero hay que hacer lo nuestro trabajar para nosotros y haciendo las cosas bien y se da el resultado
6155168 s poco a poco el equipo va mejorando cada vez se ve mejor y eso es bueno va agarrando rumbo para lo que todo mundo pretende que es el campeonato
6155169 era important simo sacar el resultado creo que el equipo a mi parecer se vio bien hizo las cosas bien y eso te da el triunfo y seguir invicto y seguir arriba
6155170 hoy m s que nunca sergio rodr guez tiene mi apoyo hoy m s que nunca si lo tuvo el d a que iba a comenzar ante cruz azul hoy m s que nunca tiene que tener el triple de apoyo de mi parte me acerco con uno y con otro estamos en constante comunicaci n y este equipo es lo que tiene platicamos abiertamente muy fuerte y nos decimos las cosas que hacen falta para crecer
6155171 al joven o cuando se equivoca alguien yo tambi n me equivocado en mi vida y tan bonito que se siente que llegue la gente y te apoye y te respalden lo menos que puedo hacer es triplicar el apoyo que he tenido para con sergio
6155172 sabemos que si afrontamos la calidad t cnica de brasil f sicamente tenemos que estar al m ximo pero no lo estamos aunque ellos tampoco
6155173 acabamos de jugar cinco partidos en 12 d as y eso es mucho con muchos viajes y con este calor
6155174 est desgastado f sicamente eso est claro porque no tenemos mucha rotaci n y hemos jugado a menudo con el mismo equipo as que ese es uno de nuestros puntos d biles contra brasil
6155175 va a ser m s dif cil para nosotros que para ellos
6155176 cuando saltas a un terreno de juego es para ganar el partido as que vamos a empezar con esa misma ambici n y a defender nuestras oportunidades vamos a hacer el m ximo por obtener esa medalla
6155177 est claro que brasil es un gran equipo ya lo sab amos antes del torneo y lo hay demostrado durante los juegos
6155178 ser un partido muy dif cil para nosotros pero a partir del momento en que estamos entre los cuatro mejores del mundo autom ticamente se juega contra un adversario de gran calidad como era el caso de nigeria que les venci 4 1 en semifinales y es el caso de brasil pero tambi n es el caso de b lgica
6155179 y no s si va a jugar con su mejor equipo o si lo har n otros jugadores
6155180 cuando juegas una semifinal s lo quieres llegar a la final y luchar por la primera plaza pero cuando no lo consigues hay una gran decepci n sobre todo cuando hab a una enorme ambici n en el equipo para clasificarse as que hay que trabajar mentalmente con el equipo
6155181 est claro que si al principio nos hubieran dicho que bamos a jugar en semifinales todos los belgas habr an firmado enseguida y con ambas manos porque ha sido un resultado extraordinario
6155182 aunque si se observa nuestra calidad de juego creo que nuestro lugar en la semifinal es l gico y merecido
6155183 no ha venido nadie del newcastle ni de ning n club
6155184 cuando empiece la competici n veremos en qu situaci n estoy mi deseo es el mismo de antes trabajar para tener minutos es importante que el t cnico conf e en m es lo mejor que le puede pasar a un futbolista espero tener minutos para poder afrontar el trabajo de otra manera ya tuve la confirmaci n de schuster y l me transmiti esa confianza
6155185 siempre me gust el 7 pero es imposible lo lleva el capit n ra l por eso cog el 9 y con l espero tener suerte esta temporada
6155186 ser un partido dif cil pero es un resultado que podemos remontar en casa siempre hay que salir a ganar no se puede especular pero seguramente ser complicado porque tienen jugadores de mucha jerarqu a nosotros estamos comprometidos a hacer un gran partido y poder ganarlo para conseguir la copa
6155187 estoy feliz fue un resultado justo para argentina que jug bastante bien la felicidad la compartimos todos los argentinos hoy es un d a lindo para disfrutar
6155188 it will never happen to me and i refuse to live in fear like a fox news watching suburbanite
6155189 i guess there will just be more and more of this as we you know turn into a third world country
6155190 i think theres getting to be a lot of anger out there
6155191 con la readaptaci n al grupo ahora veo los frutos de haber trabajado todo el verano
6155192 es una operaci n bastante complicada en la que no se puede hablar de plazos
6155193 para nosotros es muy positivo que la l nea de juego sea la misma el entrenador gregorio manzano tiene una idea de juego y el equipo la est respetando m s all de qui n est en el campo a pesar de que se hayan ido jugadores importantes el equipo trata de jugar de la misma forma se est formando un buen grupo
6155194 obviamente para la gente de aqu les gustar a que el propietario sea mallorqu n pero si no hay nadie que desea comprarlo el nuevo mandam s tendr que ser de irak o de donde sea

6155202 esta vez el sue o del oro se convirti en lata de la peor manera posible un 3 0 incontestable frente a los eternos rivales argentinos
6155203 que la apretada agenda de la selecci n en los pr ximos meses es su mayor aliada
6155204 a pesar del fracaso en los juegos la confederaci n brasile a de futbol considera que este no es el momento ideal para cambiar de entrenador ello debido a que ma ana dunga ya tiene que divulgar su lista de convocados para los pr ximos partidos
6155205 el sue o del oro ol mpico acab ayer con la peor de las pesadillas una dura derrota por 3 0 frente a argentina el mayor de los rivales el t cnico dunga vuelve a caminar sobre la cuerda floja
6155206 el t cnico sabe que un tropiezo el 7 de septiembre frente a chile puede poner fin a su ciclo en la selecci n
6155207 brasil juega muy mal y es goleada por argentina ahora s lo resta luchar por el bronce perder frente a argentina no es un resultado normal ser eliminado en juegos ol mpicos ni se habla pero llevar un baile del rival perder por 3 0 y recorrer a la violencia al final de partido es como m nimo estupidez

6155305 many states have reduced their revenue forecasts some many times
6155306 in a number of states collections are even below the lowered expectations
6155307 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
6155308 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
6155309 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
6155310 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6155311 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
6155312 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
6155313 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
6155314 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
6155315 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
6155316 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
6155317 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
6155318 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6155319 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6155320 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6155321 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6155322 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6155323 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6155324 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6155325 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6155326 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6155327 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6155328 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6155329 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6155330 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6155331 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6155332 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6155333 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6155334 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6155335 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6155336 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6155337 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6155338 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6155340 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6155341 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6155346 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6155347 instead of having the prescribed this is what were going to do today and tomorrow we look at where our students are and pull them up
6155348 before instruction didnt take into account where the students were at any given time we just didnt have a systematic way of being student centered of addressing students more individually
6155349 we all taught the same information from day to day and then tested all our math kids every three weeks on the same benchmarks
6155350 when we found shortcomings we went back and taught it again we pulled kids for tutoring i just break it down to little pieces of math and show students what they mean so they can remember im also big on homework to keep them on their toes
6155351 this report shows the nhs has taken a step in the right direction but there is still a long way to go before people with diabetes are getting the help they need to manage their condition
6155352 but what is most striking about the report is what it doesnt say almost no mention is made of the big risk that unless we effectively tackle obesity the number of people suffering with diabetes will almost certainly increase
6155353 a diabetes strategy will not be worth the paper its written on if a greater focus is not put on obesity
6155354 the government is spending an enormous amount on treating conditions caused by obesity and not nearly enough on prevention its treating the symptom rather than the underlying causes
6155355 i deeply regret that a fortnight later you have failed to act in this matter or to apologise for the severe distress that this disgraceful campaign has caused
6155356 it is simply unacceptable for the conservative party to fail to address the very serious matters that have been raised as a result of this case
6155357 the antitrust laws however give a manufacturer latitude to adopt a policy regarding a desired level of resale prices
6155358 when a great many retailers cant sell their yummy yarn inventory or their costs are such that they just cant charge only 6 and still make a profit they wont order it anymore yummy yarns is going to lose business yummy yarns might even go out of business no more yummy yarns
6155359 what makes us different from rats and mice if we are not made in the image of god
6155360 without judeo christian ethics the meaning and basis for dignity is hard to establish
6155361 a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master and deserves one
6155362 i believe this civilization is faced with a long term mastery by forces of evil and destruction i believe the jihadists are serious and will not go away because of good will this should have very little to do with your political views about iraq or how you define terrorism it has to do with how you see this civilization and whether it matters to preserve it or not i am convinced that most people including many christians do not see dangers around us and thus have little or no real interest in what it takes to save a great civilization

6155364 de moderne mens leeft nog in de warmte van een reeds ondergegane zon wellicht begint nu iets van de kou voelbaar te worden en daarmee iets van de noodzaak van een hernieuwde bezinning op religie
6155365 als het oog niet straalt kan het de zon niet zien was gods kracht niet binnen in ons niets goddelijks zou ons in vervoering brengen
6155366 het leven van een mens is wat zijn gedachten ervan maken
6155367 een van de vergissingen van de westerse godsdiensten is dat ze hebben verkondigd dat de mens zonder goddelijke hulp ongeneeslijk ego stisch is
6155368 alleen de liefde overwint alleen de liefde behoudt wanneer de hemel een mens wil behoeden vervult hij diens hart met liefde
6155369 wat wij toeval noemen is misschien de logica van god

6155371 well being in the life of western society has begun to reveal its pernicious mask
6155372 the defense of individual rights has reached such extremes as to make society as a whole defenseless against certain individuals it is time in the west to defend not so much
6155373 and all of this was said before there was a cnn fox news or msnbc to fill us with 24 7 nonsense
6155374 do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thereby share responsibility for the sins of others
6155375 dont worry about anything this is god and all god since bentley has raised people from the dead
6155376 how do we really know god said x or y or z
6155377 reason is the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things but more frequently than not struggles against the divine word treating with contempt all that emanates from god
6155378 the waves are really big 2 metres and what shall we do
6155379 i live here on less than a dollar a month
6155380 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6155381 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6155382 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes it was like meeting a complete stranger
6155383 huruma is a tough place last january during the elections there was rioting and six people were hacked to death the police dont even arrest you they just shoot you
6155384 i have seen two of my friends killed i have scars from defending myself with my fists i am good with my fists
6155385 everyone knows i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges of being my british bestie

6155387 because of the miniaturization of all kinds of spacecraft technology these nano and micro spacecraft are becoming more plausible and possible in many types of missions
6155388 its our dream and vision and hope that eventually we can place smaller spacecraft in all types of missions not just in near earth orbit
6155389 for those missions you can be at various distances from the sun and being able to change your thermal balance is a good thing
6155390 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
6155391 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
6155392 he has had access to british tv in his hotel and knows that if he does come back he might never be able to leave again
6155393 thai airlines are looking for someone who would take him at the moment but that is not an easy task

6155396 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
6155397 russia has long been told to simply accept the facts heres the independence of kosovo for you heres the abrogation of the antiballistic missile treaty and the american decision to place missile defenses in neighboring countries heres the unending expansion of nato all of these moves have been set against the backdrop of sweet talk about partnership why would anyone put up with such a charade
6155398 has been far from fair and balanced especially during the first days of the crisis
6155399 clearly wanted to make sure that whatever the outcome russia would be blamed for worsening the situation the west then mounted a propaganda attack against russia with the american news media leading the way
6155400 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
6155401 how as president do you negotiate your job when the constitution is in conflict with your understanding of christianity
6155402 why didnt the possession of christianity prevent maher arar from being tortured
6155403 i was getting breakfast and thought ah i just dont want to talk to her today so i bumped it
6155404 then two seconds later there was a message from nicole wishing us good luck
6155405 i ended up returning her call she was very happy she was very surprised that we do have a tradition of naming our boats after her movies and shes just really stoked to be part of a team

6155408 as an entrepreneur i am always looking for ways to diversify my portfolio with good ideas and good people
6155409 i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6155410 its a beautiful day i think ill resign and go fishing
6155411 in the end president pervez musharraf went if not quietly with remarkably little strife
6155412 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
6155413 endeavouring to cause prospective defendants to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony
6155414 there is a cloud over the vice president and that cloud remains because the defendant libby obstructed justice
6155415 in making the case for war the administration repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated contradicted or even non existent as a result the american people were led to believe that the threat from iraq was much greater than actually existed
6155416 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
6155417 were starting our work and then were doing it in a period where congress is in recess im calling everybody back
6155418 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary
6155419 the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties
6155420 it just says that that john mccains his own guy and beats to his own drum
6155421 they have been friends for twenty years and somebody is not going to tell john mccain not to have one of his longstanding best friends who does have a star quality not to be the keynote speaker as far as whether it is orchestrated to appeal to a certain group or not i just dont think thats the case
6155422 they have a lot of common interest on the issues
6155423 the vote that rudy would have had to have to win that primary was john mccains vote and if john mccain had faltered rudy would have absorbed a lot of that vote
6155424 repeat rows 3 through 6 i write out those rows
6155425 western leaders anxiously watching for a withdrawal and puzzling over how to punish moscow for what they called a disproportionate reaction to the georgian offensive
6155426 the june 24 1992 sochi agreement established a cease fire between the georgian and south ossetian forces and defined both a zone of conflict around the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali and a security corridor along the border of south ossetian territories the agreement also created the joint control commission jcc and a peacekeeping body the joint peacekeeping forces group jpkf the jpkf is under russian command and is comprised of peacekeepers from georgia russia and russias north ossetian autonomous republic as the separatist south ossetian government remained unrecognized south ossetian peacekeepers however serve in the north ossetian contingent the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce agreed to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate negotiations
6155427 security corridor along the the border of the south ossetian territories
6155428 it may not be possible to rescue south ossetia tiny and without resources from becoming a russian protectorate or even part of the russian federation and most of its people seem to want that
6155429 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia
6155430 i think they misunderstand our eagerness and enthusiasm and think we are going to be behind them for anything
6155431 it is hard to imagine that georgian president mikheil saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the united states
6155432 the new cold war has long since been instigated by the usa through the americans so called missile defence shield in the czech republic and poland
6155433 the union of the three slavic republics russia ukraine belarus and kazakhstan
6155434 but even he did not manage to make ukraine a gift of sevastopol which remained a separate city under the jurisdiction of the ussr central government
6155435 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
6155436 what worries me about this episode is the united states is jeopardising russian cooperation on a number of issues over a dispute that at most involves limited american interests
6155437 jed babbin one of our military analysts is hosting the michael medved nationally syndicated radio show this afternoon he would like to see if general george w casey would be available for a phone interview
6155438 this would be a softball interview and the show is 8th or 9th in the nation
6155439 i hope you are getting a cut of babbins action as his agent
6155440 im subbing for hugh hewitt again tomorrow and want to bash the un report
6155441 i asked for u s army major general jay hood and got the answer that the military isnt going out on that now can you do it please call asap
6155442 he is going to be on the cnbc show kudlow amp company tonight and want sic to be prepared if they ask him about the al qaeda threat to saudi oil fields anything we could share with him
6155443 fox news hannity and colmes is having jed babbin on today to talk about north korea
6155444 we are getting jed a one pager on the status of forces in the korean peninsula the message being we still have a massive deterrent there for north korea we will also put him into touch with state for talking points on the 6 party talks
6155445 i have information thats given to me by sources of all sorts private information is what you normally do in washington you get confidential sources and you rely on them im not compromised i cant speak for anybody else other than myself but i have no relationship with defense contractors i have no contracts with the pentagon theres no conflict there
6155446 when you hire a former general as a media commentator youre hiring him for his expertise and his ability to independently analyze whats going on
6155447 if youre assuming because hes retired he has a measure of independence and then you find out no hes actually been to all these trainings where hes received talking points thats a problem you have promised your audience that youre going to deliver them independent analysis not a mouthpiece for the pentagon
6155448 the journalists had the obligation to figure out if their sources were independent
6155449 each show decided how they were going to use these people and at that point somebody shouldve been having a conversation about what theyre bringing to the product and how that works and then finally there should be an overall standard that says when we hire people here is what we should ask of them
6155450 everyone i wrote for and so forth knew i was talking to people in the pentagon
6155451 im not sure if jed mentioned he was a part of the department of defenses military analyst program he might at some point he said over the years though that hes been part of many many briefings at the pentagon most when he was actually working there under bush 41
6155452 jed babbin is the editor of human events he wrote for national review he wrote for american spectator hes conservative
6155453 were a conservative talk show mr babbins been on our show many many times over the years and he comes from a conservative background he was privy to a number of briefings we took advantage of hearing what was in those briefings
6155454 if they were buying my loyalty they got a pretty bad bargain if they thought they were buying my reporting they really had a very poor investment look at my stories look at what ive written ive been very highly critical at times of the president and a lot of the people who conduct the war
6155455 we really should try to help babbin secure guests for his radio hosting gigs he is consistently solid and helpful
6155456 im sure all your folks are familiar with the tremendous support weve received from jed
6155457 i have lined up the support of most of them but also wanted to highlight the secretarys role in having started these gatherings
6155458 you see the clinton crowd simply ignored us and hoped we would just go away you guys deserve credit for having had the smarts to invite us into the fold with all the hell that gets raised in washington about government cover ups and concealments its actually refreshing that somebody thought to inform some rather knowledgeable observers about what was really going on
6155459 i know ken quite well and i dont know why he gave it that characterization
6155460 i asked a lot of tough questions and sometimes got answers that were satisfactory and some that werent
6155461 the briefings and all other interactions with the military analysts had been suspended indefinitely pending an internal review
6155462 but obviously i talk to a lot of people in this town

6155466 for years i have felt a desire to uncover something buried inside i am pulled in two directions by life i know something of what the two directions look like my mothers side a side filled with joy and light and my stern and severe aunts filled with darkness repression and judgment sometimes it is as if i am both those people the forces are stronger than i can understand and the directions both a part of me sometimes make me feel a house divided
6155467 the crowd many of them hallucinating on one drug or another bleary eyed and for some reason angry not peaceful pushing up toward the stage was filled with disorderliness and hallucination
6155468 mahlers early fame came from his songs the cornerstones to his symphonies
6155469 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
6155470 the most dangerous thing most of us will ever do
6155471 statistically driving in the u s gets safer every year
6155472 most of us hold on to some simple myths of independence and power
6155473 but in fact driving is an incredibly difficult and demanding task
6155474 you dont see those back east they interfere with snowplows
6155475 im a midwesterner by birth kind of a polite guy
6155476 california highways make me nervous theres often no breakdown lane on the shoulder of the road
6155477 i just talked to a woman here judy ann lundblad who runs a driving school she has a lot of foreign clients who all say the u s driving test is basically a joke youre on the road for 20 minutes answer 20 questions and they give you a license
6155478 to pass the british driving test it takes on the average 2 6 or 2 7 attempts the british are much safer on the road and have a much lower fatality rate than the u s i was curious about the link between that driving test and subsequent road behavior
6155479 initially i was just kind of interested in road behavior in general
6155480 there was much more to leave out than there was to find
6155481 i had thousands of documents and certain things that could be entire chapters it could be an encyclopedia

6155690 we made our customers aware of the situation at norwalk and we secured their down payments and we continued to sell the furniture while the factory was going through their situation over those two weeks
6155691 every customer was willing to take the chance and hope the factory would be able to produce their furniture
6155692 actually in july our sales were almost exactly the same as last july thats how supportive people were with us even with the tough economic conditions

6155710 we sit to eat meat speak of love charity rights of man sacredness of life far away blood flows cries rise in the night
6155711 there is no good man we are all killers we live on others
6155712 the immediate horror man perceives is his own death but beyond that he begins to see the process of life as carnage as eating and being eaten a terrible screaming pervades the universe man is the first to hear it
6155713 there is no knowledge of death no watching ones fateful progression no history no vision of ones actual condition
6155714 wind damage wont be our issue but rain will be
6155715 pushing the overall death rate for motor vehicle accidents to a historic low
6155716 fa de kosovo i osetia mai lipse te n transnistria n r un singur lucru conflictul iar din acest punct de vedere am apreciat capacitatea republicii moldova de a nu r spunde provoc rilor transnistrene mi se pare c se dep e te orice limit a decen ei atunci c nd transnistrenii refuz orice discu ii cu autoritatea suveran a statului moldovean

6155718 our results conclusively prove there is a causal relationship between immunization schedules and diabetes
6155719 the recent data shows that common childhood vaccines are especially dangerous to children with a strong family history of diabetes
6155720 parents of a child with a strong family history of insulin dependent diabetes should know that the administration of a full series of vaccines may have a greater than 5 percent chance of causing their child to develop diabetes
6155721 most took the apples but some were quite curious and maybe suspicious
6155722 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6155723 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6155724 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6155725 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6155726 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6155727 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6155728 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6155729 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6155730 this database is in a sense worse than a watch list
6155731 at least in the watch list scenario theres some reason why the name got on the list here the only thing a person does to come to the attention of dhs is to lawfully cross the border the theory of this data collection is track everyone just in case
6155732 new technology and systems designed to enhance border security or identify other violations of law
6155733 there was absolutely no way they should have the entire database
6155734 once you have data in a database you dont need it lends itself to unauthorized use
6155735 a person opts to go over the border their information is going to be collected and held anyway
6155736 if you dont want to go over the border you dont have to
6155737 to accomplish an agency function related to this system of records
6155738 when there exists a legitimate public interest in the disclosure of the information
6155739 now that the democrats were nice enough to fold up on fisa
6155740 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
6155741 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
6155742 so the next president cant do a damn thing about unraveling this disaster which is appropriately enough an embryonic police state
6155743 efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns
6155744 given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
6155745 im carrying a weapon flying a multimillion dollar jet with passengers but im still screened as you know on the terrorist watch list
6155746 theres going to come a point in time where everybodys on the list
6155747 and all of a sudden he says how old is he
6155748 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
6155749 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
6155750 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
6155751 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
6155752 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
6155753 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll
6155754 people are always saying what poverty stricken circumstances we live in and how terrible everything is here do they not realise that i worked hard to have that tablecloth on my table that it is the best that i can afford i like my things i worked for them we dont want pity we want work we want our own things
6155755 trust me everybody is less mysterious than they think they are

6155776 we heard a big crash so we stopped and we saw a lot of smoke
6155777 atheism i believe becomes more popular when religious communities become more corrupt and especially when their corruption includes violence this occurred in the decades after the thirty years war in european history and i think were entering a similar period today when religion seems to produce violent or arrogant or hypocritical believers many people decided it is more ethical not to believe when the worlds second largest religion seems to many people too tolerant of terrorism and sectarian violence and sometimes even encourages and justifies them we shouldnt be surprised that many people reject religion when the worlds largest religion seems to many people too tolerant of militarism unjustified war and consumerism and sometimes even encourages and justifies them we should be even less surprised when both religions do too little to promote active peacemaking care for the poor concern for the environment and the renewal of communities when they seem more concerned with straining out gnats of religious trivia than swallowing camels of massive social injustice we should only be surprised that more people havent become atheists
6155778 interesting that you should say this as in your previous blog you wrote funny ive never raped anyone
6155779 funny millions of christians have never justified death and persecution on gods will
6155780 science cannot be used to justify discounting the great monotheistic religions of the world which rest upon centuries of history moral philosophy and the powerful evidence provided by human altruism
6155781 both parties share the blame in turning a blind eye to atrocities done throughout humanity
6155782 the terrible violence of the 20th century has nothing to do with right thinking rational enlightened people like me
6155783 the product of such zeal is often justified in the name of christianity but in reality it has nothing to do with believing in jesus christ
6155784 conservative christians have championed the idea that the truth is intolerant they shouldnt really be surprised to find atheists who share their views that intolerance is a virtue one of the goals of off the map a non profit organization founded in 2000 is to make christians kinder one of the ways in which we believe conservative christianity is broken is that it has made being right the most important thing being kind is secondary adherents to this take the scriptural exhortation to speak the truth in love and subvert that into if i am speaking the truth to someone that is inherently a loving thing to do and conversely if i am not speaking the truth then no matter how kind i am being i am falling short of showing love to that other person
6155785 the new atheism is too cut off from emotion from intuition and from a spirit of generosity toward those who see the world differently
6155786 folder is used to store a text based version of umbraco templates so that i can keep them under version control as ive had a situation in the past where someone copied over the wrong template not very pretty
6155787 a nonstop flight to the red planet remains a dubious venture to further kill our collective space buzz yesterday wired broke the news that
6155788 using electronic brainstorming and web tools to create breakthrough innovations
6155789 adopting a compressed work week would take approximately 20 percent of federal employees off the roads on any given weekday generating significant cost savings for the american taxpayer without a drop in productivity or decrease in service
6155790 state and local governments across the nation including new mexico virginia and utah are implementing four day workweeks to conserve energy reduce fuel consumption and alleviate congestion
6155791 many management officials are finding that the use of flexible and compressed work schedules can help resolve a number of personnel problems
6155792 the business of the federal government is no longer conducted on a strictly 9 to 5 basis and these options increase agency flexibility to respond to emerging issues
6155793 this only makes sense when you consider that working people are unable to keep up with ever increasing prices of gasoline
6155794 the planes are still in the air people are scared and are staying indoors
6155795 our opinion is that this drastically impacts womens health care and their access to birth control and actually takes some forms of birth control and interprets them as abortion particularly hormonal birth control
6155796 would allow providers to withhold critical health care information without telling their patients
6155797 i was completely shocked that now three years after it had happened to me were coming back to this
6155798 its good to watch and its going to show what bmx is about
6155799 a lot of people think it is kids riding on the street
6155800 just about every kid out there has a bmx bike i hope it shows well on tv and we put on a good show
6155801 this is a big opportunity to be at the olympic games and now everyone gets to enjoy this crazy little sport
6155802 they have to do it a little more craftily than in the past but it wouldnt be too hard for them the conservatives to set a trap for the liberals
6155803 prime minister stephen harper can engineer the defeat of his government in 30 seconds
6155804 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6155805 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc qu b cois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately mr dion has indicated that the government has to be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
6155806 a lot of patience and because i struck at the right time
6155807 a bit of reform party hocus pocus so now harper is caught in that but not really caught
6155808 he wants to get the opposition especially the liberals to put up or shut up
6155809 and so this is a lot of posturing and chest beating on behalf of both harper and dion
6155810 i dont think the liberals can continue to play the same game
6155811 now that stage is over and mr dion is the one who has to make a tough decision
6155812 we couldnt carry out a better operation at the mossad than to put a guy like ahmadinejad in power in iran

6155842 our laboratory recently discovered that even when pten is produced normally by a cell it has to be properly localized within the nucleus in order to maintain its full tumor suppressive abilities
6155843 indeed its been demonstrated that in a variety of cancers pten has broken away from the nucleus with these new findings we now understand how this happens
6155844 from there we observed that the loss of another tumor suppressor known as pml whose mutation is a main cause of acute promyelocytic leukemia was at the root of ptens escape from the nucleus
6155845 we discovered that this pathway is disrupted through the loss or mutation of pml as well as through unchecked hausp expression either of which can force pten from the nucleus and prevent its ability to act as a tumor suppressor
6155846 we wanted to draw attention not to a prevalent threat but to a possible future one

6155973 we hope this study will increase awareness among researchers and help raise the bar on how we use wild animals in research
6155974 while wildlife researchers have made some great strides in addressing animal welfare concerns by using minimally obtrusive capture and handling techniques we found that some commonly used procedures still have potential to cause injury change normal behavior or more generally affect health in a negative manner
6155975 this finding warrants more detailed investigation of specific and cumulative effects of other stressors that bears may be exposed to during and after capture for example sample collection marking and carrying radiotransmitters
6155976 this finding is particularly important because as body condition fades so too does an animals potential for growth reproduction and survival
6155977 not only do researchers have a role to play but so do government wildlife agencies and funding agencies in supporting research to improve capture procedures and validate alternative techniques to capture

6155985 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6155986 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6155987 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level

6156016 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
6156017 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

6156024 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
6156025 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
6156026 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
6156027 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
6156028 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6156029 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6156030 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6156031 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6156032 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6156033 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6156034 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6156035 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6156036 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6156037 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6156038 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6156039 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6156040 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

6156043 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6156044 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6156046 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6156047 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6156050 i put on some lovely frank sinatra music and am completely lost in my own little fantasy world in our marriage i am very much a lady and kevin is the breadwinner and my protector i dont even put petrol in our ford anglia car which is 43 years old because i think that is so unladylike i ask kevin to do it i try not to interact with the modern world too much at all shopping in supermarkets is an ordeal and i only recently realised that tony blair is no longer prime minister as i dont read newspapers they are just too distressing my despair at the modern world is one of the reasons why we havent had children i would be terrified they would be offered drugs or become the victims of violence
6156051 we arent friendly with anyone who doesnt share our love of the forties
6156052 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh

6156115 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6156116 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6156117 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6156118 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6156119 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6156120 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6156121 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6156122 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6156123 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6156124 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6156125 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
6156126 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
6156127 the difference in mood between the liberal blogosphere and the conservative blogosphere is striking
6156128 the democratic campaign in the fall is going to have to be much much tougher than the summer campaign was
6156129 not all is lost folks obama has time and money to make a shift but if you thought that somehow this year was going to be different something would change and somehow the american electorate would look completely different this year than any other year the numbers today just dont show that this isnt a transformative election its another hardscrabble claw out each and every vote election to win that kind of election you need to fight for every vote and fight hard thats why you hear the concern you hear from josh marshall john aravosis joe sudbay etc and its backed up by years of experience watching the republicans make democrats look weak jimmy carter walter mondale al gore and john kerry that line of attack works when not countered and we were defeated none of us want that in 2008
6156130 i dont doubt that obama receives reports about what mccain is saying in speeches and ads and summaries of what the talking heads are saying about obamas reaction to those attacks but my guess is that no one has assembled and screened for him a clip reel of the worst of the worst the stuff that obamas supporters not to mention undecided voters have been seeing if he actually saw that ugly onslaught would he really stick to his high road would he remain content to talk policy and to demur with dignity when mccain and his minions slime him rather than go on the attack and set the agenda himself the last democratic presidential candidate who failed to engage who abjured ruthlessness because it wasnt consistent with the noble kind of politics he wanted america to practice was michael dukakis that misreading of what it takes to win and not the howdy doody tank photo was what sank his campaign
6156131 why hasnt obama gone after mccain why havent we seen some populist fire so clearly in order
6156132 mccains message is pretty clear and essentially twofold 1 obama is in so many words a frivolous phony someone who really doesnt have any business running for president 2 mccain is a strong leader who can defend the country there are all sorts of sub and secondary themes obamas an outsider questionably american etc but all the nitty gritty points are subservient to those two interlocking messages from obama honestly i dont sense a really clear message there are attacks on mccain some of which are quite good there are positive uplifting commercials and there are ads messages targeted to particular states like yucca mountain in nevada and the dhl layoffs in ohio but its hard for me to come up with a clear cut obama message in way that its pretty simple for me to do with mccain even the change message which is the basis of obamas campaign seems much more diffuse to me than it was during the primaries
6156133 beating up on mccain is critical but its not a message in itself and the obama campaign needs to deepen peoples trust in obama not because of all the smears because an outsider running to overturn the status quo always faces trust issues but again not a message for my money the essence of this campaign is are you happy with the way the countrys been run for the last 7 5 years has our foreign policy left us better off republican economic policy you can go through all the different facets but its clear that the public overwhelmingly thinks the bush presidency has been little short of a disaster and do you want four more years of that if thats the frame of the election mccain will be crushed people know they dont want four more years of bush mccain will be another four years of bush its time for change etc thats the essence of the campaign but the message right now seems very muddled
6156134 regardless of how you do the measuring there is a strong argument that if the election were today mccain would win it would be a nail biter either way but for the first time it is arguable that mccain is ahead today
6156135 david gergen real clear politics map showing john mccain moving ahead in the electoral college for the first time this includes leaners and it might be a bit early to start making d c hotel reservations for jan 20 but
6156136 obama is in a free fall mccain got to the heart of the question about obama and especially after the crisis in georgia he has voters wondering whether obama is up to the task of running the presidency as his first executive job in politics even a strong vp pick may not help reverse that perception and could make it worse by overshadowing the nominee democrats may not have been in a weaker position at convention time since 1984
6156137 a large cache of documents housed in the richard j daley library at the university of illinois at chicago uic is likely to flesh out the story not only would these files illuminate the working relationship between obama and bill ayers they would also provide significant insight into a web of ties linking obama to various radical organizations including obama approved foundation gifts to political allies obamas leadership style and abilities are also sure to be illuminated by the documents in question unfortunately i dont yet have access to the documents the special collections section of the richard j daley library agreed to let me read them but just before i boarded my flight to chicago the top library officials mysteriously intervened to bar access circumstances strongly suggest the likelihood that bill ayers himself may have played a pivotal role in this denial
6156138 stanley kurtz has done yeomans work trying to uncover the true nature of the relationship between barack obama and weather underground terrorist turned academic william ayers
6156139 for a man with such a meager track record obama and his friends sure seem anxious about anyone checking into it for his experience and his associations a public university operating a public project should provide transparency on these issues and not stall until after the election
6156140 this is a ticking time bomb for the obama campaign they are doing their best through proxies to stop the release of the annenberg records from the university of illinois chicago uic why because as points out the release of the records will fatally undermine obamas narrative about his associations with bill ayers obamas pure as the driven snow despite the terrorists who love me narrative would be destroyed with the release of the annenberg records
6156141 hows that old saying go its the cover up not the crime and we know one individual involved here is already capable of committing a crime with all that cash from the man being available at the center of this lets hope theres no crime involving ayers or anyone else hmm
6156142 i think the democrats may be overstating bidens electoral appeal rasmussen has conducted polling on joe biden at various times and in each case bidens favorables unfavorables were pretty close to even basically i think he is identified enough with the unpopular institution of the congress that he will be viewed by a lot of people as a partisan but doesnt compensate for that by generating enthusiastic responses from the base the way some other candidates might biden is fairly well known by far the best know candidate of the in sen evan bayh biden va gov tim kaine ks gov kathleen sebelius group so perceptions of him are liable to be fairly entrenched and may not be enhanced by the fluffy sort of treatment that the vp candidate usually tends to get from the press there are some positives though bidens numbers are quite strong among seniors a group with whom obama is underperforming and fairly strong among moderates he would probably lock up pennsylvania for obama both because he is well known in the philly burbs and because pennsylvania has an older electorate and might play well somewhere like florida
6156143 the vice presidential trial balloon of the week seems to be joe biden coming on the heels of evan bayh he seems like a huge relief to many but it may be one of those situations where you feel better simply because you stop hitting your head against the wall a lot of the vice presidential choices value boils down to chemistry and obama and biden very well may have it but biden voted for the aumf and the patriot act so all those who thought a vp who undermined obamas message of change would just not be acceptable will no doubt be uncontrollably vexed or not then theres the problem that biden has a history of saying really stupid stuff which could turn out to be a plus i suppose if he draws the flies off obama an unusual election strategy to say the least
6156144 biden has a history of racially insensitive and offensive remarks google biden racism and you get over 440 000 results documenting his racist bloopers selecting biden would be a great way to turn off the black voter base that the democratic party will need to win this election if this guy were a republican democrats would be hanging him out to dry all he needs is a confederate flag to complete the picture were talking major macaca moment potential here and yes as hilarious for ex va sen george allen as that was is obama ready to sign up a vp with a record of racism comments including one aimed straight at himself during the primaries i doubt it
6156145 bidens vote for the bankruptcy bill was unconscionable and the man is a wholly owned subsidiary of the credit card companies the senator from mbna indeed i also find him grating and obnoxious on a personal level and im not sure hed wear well with voters over the long haul nor am i that confident that bidens much vaunted foreign cred is all its cracked up to be not only did he vote for the war but his partition plan for iraq has been condemned by some foreign policy types whose work i respect
6156146 bidens case is probably stronger than i previously indicated because he tends to be most popular among voting groups with a lot of undecided voters which means a lot of persuadables in particular bidens strength with senior citizens could be a real asset how so because seniors are far more likely to be undecided in this election than their younger counterparts what a biden pick really would be is a redux of gore lieberman al gore got quite a large bounce in florida when he selected joe lieberman and if obama were to pick biden he is probably committed to playing florida out to the end or at least until the last 15 days of the campaign
6156147 its certainly true that i could not in good conscience imagine voting for the bankruptcy bill but thats one of the many reasons i wouldnt make it in electoral politics as best i can tell everyone casts unconscionable votes in defense of home state industries certainly im not aware of any senators who are innocent of this particular sin and barack obama coal ethanol is no exception to the general trend i think bidens vote for the 2002 iraq aumf is a serious problem its a bit hard for me to see how obama simultaneously says that his no vote is an important demonstration of good judgment despite a lack of experience and also that joe biden is a great and experienced foreign policy expert maybe theres a brilliant solution to that but it seems tricky to me
6156148 it looks like a toss up right now between biden and kaine given that choice i have a slight preference for kaine ive always liked joe biden but hes too risky for me and i dont agree with him on some major foreign policy issues kaine is a better fit for obamas brand and hell help in virginia which could be a decisive state im not thrilled with kaine either but i prefer him to bayh i still am holding out hope for jack reed or kathleen sebelius id be psyched about either one of them kaine and biden would be just okay bayh would annoy the crap out of me but maybe there will be a big surprise
6156149 kaines positives are that he is from virginia worked as an urban housing rights lawyer speaks spanish was an extremely early obama supporter and opposed the war from the start his negatives are that he has seems pretty right wing bidens strengths are that he is familiar with the national media has recent georgia cred is an excellent debater is a tough attack dog wont become the democratic favorite in the next presidential nomination campaign and is generally his negatives are that he supported the war from the start muddles the change message because he has been in the senate for 36 years is often known as representing mbna instead of delaware including his support for the bankruptcy bill i dont think it is an entirely clear choice biden would almost certainly be a better campaigner and a better president but kaine is far more a reinforcing pick than biden so it is hard to turn away now
6156150 my best guess today as ive said for days now is that obamas choice is surge of concern over the former momentum of evan bayhs selection a wide range of support exists for joe biden tom daschle and evan bayh were called and told they will not be it according to several sources i dont have anything on tim kaine other than insiders tell me that obama has decided against him mostly because he doesnt help check off the foreign policy box or experience box i just dont hear much about kathleen sebelius so am not counting her as a strong candidate but has biden heard a word from obama or his team my sources say no according to one source there has been total radio silence well be thankful for radio silence i guess when other candidates for vp are getting phone calls saying sorry but we look forward to working with you in many other ways in the coming years the word that obama has not communicated with biden makes him in the estimation of many the likely candidate as obama knows that biden will accept on a moments notice i confirmed this with a person very close to the delaware senator
6156151 we know obama likes daschle we know daschle was vetted and we know he has a speaker slot on wed we even know hes floated as a potential cos in the wh it makes sense too of the whole vp process weve been watching unfold for obama
6156152 mayhill has been following kerry on the stump off and on for the past few weeks and has seen a man transformed a man infused with an energy and enthusiasm even a lightness of spirit that balance nicely with his unshakable gravitas it may be a desire to return the favors karl rove and the swiftboaters dealt him in 2004 it may be that kerry is sincerely impressed and energized by the prospect of an obama camelot we think its both whatever is inspiring kerry lately however its indisputable that kerry is inspired and some inspiration is what barack obama needs and may well have chosen to add to his ticket
6156153 sebelius of course would be the bold unconventional choice very obama but by choosing a female running mate obama would unfortunately thrust the hillary die hards and their ever more marginal discontentment back into the spotlight that said anyone who believes that only hillary clinton deserves to be the first female president or vice president doesnt deserve the designation feminist so id relish watching the reactions to a sebelius nod not only because such a choice would double down on obamas most effective message change but because it would reveal exactly which clinton boosters are ready to widen the lens and enthusiastically support womens leadership as such
6156154 in general i think it makes sense for a republican presidential nominee to leave open the possibility of picking a pro choice running mate but ultimately to pick a pro lifer kathryn jean lopez has been suggesting that mccain is doing just that right now if so i fear his campaign has misplayed the issue at this point if mccain picks a pro lifer wont his opponents say he was browbeat by the far right
6156155 news reports say that john mccain is keeping joe lieberman in the running for vp thats fine with me not because i think mccain will pick lieberman if he does hes so openly disrespectful of the policies and priorities of his base and so dismissive of his need for their support that his judgment is in question but keeping lieberman in the mix even as conservatives like me reiterate our strong opposition to a democrat as veep on the republican ticket plays well for mccain its designed to send a message to independents just as his supposed openness to a pro choice running mate was supposed to reassure pumas hes using the veep process to re establish his credentials as a maverick who may not always toe the gop line without actually moving left on any policies and if talking up ct sen joe lieberman helps him in florida hes not averse to that either
6156156 to me lieberman wouldnt be the best pick but he wouldnt be the worst either there is much to commend the do no harm vp calculus lieberman wouldnt be a do no harm pick if you do the static analysis is lieberman better than say rob portman its all wrong the difference is that any of the conventional picks dont help mccain with his 1 priority winning the election despite narrowing the gap mccain is currently about 3 points behind he needs a better vp pick than obama will come up with and unless obama chooses clinton obamas pick will be safe and milquetoast lieberman is the most obvious opportunity to shake up the calculus of the race picking him did something for al gore in 2000 taking him from a sure loser to a position of strength in the fall a conservative vp on a losing ticket is still a losing ticket
6156157 the addition of joe lieberman will not convince independents that mccain is a maverick it will convince an already skeptical gop base that mccain is a rino patrick knows better than most how essential enthusiasm is to the gotv efforts and fundraising mccain appears to have finally generated some of that enthusiasm and picking lieberman would snuff it out for good republicans respect lieberman but they dont want a liberal democrat as the person who would succeed to the presidency if something happened to mccain which is the entire point of the vice presidency lieberman may not be the worst choice but hes close to it if mccain wants a democrat let him pick john breaux whose positions really do reflect conservative values otherwise the republican party has plenty of options for a republican ticket
6156158 should senator john mccain choose a pro choice running mate we are comfortably enough in touch with the republican base to say without hesitation that the majority of the base would sit this race out and we could not blame them for it
6156159 mccain doesnt need any bank shots or game changers he needs what was on display saturday night at saddleback a confidence in the rightness of center right ideas across a range of issues and of course a deep belief in american exceptionalism a conventional but base energizing choice mitt romney or tim pawlenty will keep the momentum going and reveal no deficit of confidence in mccains ideas or the core ideas of his party
6156160 happy now the network will be formally announcing this tomorrow but i am pleased to inform you in this fully authorized leak that as of monday september 8 our mutual friend ms maddow will become host of her own show on msnbc at 9 pm eastern time
6156161 an hour of olbermann then an hour of maddow thats going to make watching msnbc so much more fun
6156162 this is proof that even in todays disgusting nepotistic and cutthroat media world a world that too often rewards idiocy and the idiots that spout the idiocy good things can happen to good people
6156163 well this is just great news rachel is one of the smartest people i know a great broadcaster and an all around cool person so shell certainly bring light to important stories otherwise ignored by everyone else in cable news but rachel will also draw an audience not necessarily predisposed to liberalism with rachel on the air viewers will get the opportunity to watch real news instead of bluster and i bet a sizable number will jump at the chance
6156164 jen rubin argues for the mccain one term pledge of which i believe ramesh ponnuru has been the strongest proponent theres a lot in what they argue but im not convinced yet i probably could be if i knew mccain were going to pick a veep who would energize conservatives both this year and as the 2012 heir apparent for us the biggest problem with a mccain presidency whether one or two terms would be its front loaded nature mccains greatest service to conservatives would be beating obama that is no small thing but it is one that would be fully accomplished even before mccain took office after that what leverage would we have if mccain had run on a one term pledge he wouldnt need us to be re elected and he has demonstrated in the past that building a conservative republican party for the future is not a top priority for him hed want to ring up some presidential accomplishments and the democrats with increased numbers in congress would be the only game in town the one term pledge would certainly help mccain big time with hillary democrats and independents if he picks a good veep the pledge could help mccain with us it could even help him with at least some in the media for whom the prospect of covering you decide 2012 for four full years beginning this november might be even more irresistable than obama all in all it would increase his chances of getting elected i concede that this is no small thing in light of the frightening specter of an obama presidency maybe its the most important thing but as far as governing goes i dont see much in it for mccain or for us
6156165 im hearing that tensions were high recently when veteran actor robert duvall was taping a voice over for a video to be played during the republican national convention apparently the veteran actor objected to the direction he was receiving from republican media guru fred davis according to my sources duvall said something along the lines of f you fred if scorsese couldnt give me direction what the hell makes you think you can though this blow up is actually recorded on tape my guess is its in everyones best interest for this to not leak out
6156166 with each passing month i find one article after another claiming to have the magic formula needed for desktop linux to see significant

6156168 we aim to be the most competitive marketplace online and this new incredibly low pricing helps us achieve that goal a 35 cent listing fee virtually eliminates the upfront cost for sellers to put more of their great inventory on ebay and creates more opportunity than ever for sellers to build successful businesses
6156169 we love auctions auction style listings remain the ideal choice for sellers who are uncertain about the value of their item have a scarce item in high demand or are willing to start at a low price and let bidding determine the final value with these changes were making sure sellers have competitive opportunities in both formats auction style and fixed price

6156205 it may be typical of the pro obama dungeons and dragons crowd to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
6156206 with obama there is vast disagreement about just how liberal he is especially on the economy
6156207 some of the confusion stems from obamas own strategy of presenting himself as a postpartisan figure a few weeks ago i joined him on a flight from orlando to chicago and began our conversation by asking about his economic approach he started to answer but then interrupted himself
6156208 when obama gives a speech about his economic plan there is often a moment when you can sense him shift from poetry to prose he can be inspiring when talking about how the country ended up being the envy of the world but when he comes to the part about what he wants to do next how he wants to keep america the envy of the world it can sound a little like a state of the union laundry list
6156209 his advisers are divided about how much of a problem this is some of them told me that he did have a unifying theme the middle class squeeze and that it would become clearer to voters as they began paying closer attention to the race

6156241 the public service commission is said to have failed to uphold its own regulations provisions and general orders and its own circulars and instructions
6156242 there have been a number of cases over the years where laptops in particular have caught fire and caused serious damage and bodily harm a few ipod problems certainly does not signify a real threat among the larger product line i think there are tens of millions of ipods out there that never cause fires
6156243 these raids have been made possible through operation valoma that was initiated by police to work together with the relevant stakeholders in the province
6156244 from what we understand the plants were to be ready for harvesting at the end of the year and ready for sale on the streets over the festive season
6156245 police were tipped off by villagers who came across the farms while pig hunting
6156246 theses people who are farming marijuana are moving to what we call is no mans land no villagers live around here as it is very isolated
6156247 many of the discoveries have been stumbled upon by accident so the farmers are moving their farms further inside by the time police arrive there is no one there
6156248 we do face challenges but its not that big and it can be minimised because we are now working very closely with the main stakeholders in the area which are the chiefs the villagers and the church which is very important for us
6156249 the main disadvantage is that keyasi is a very big and remote area and there are a lot of roads through the area
6156250 but in order to deal with the drug crime we need to have the assistance of other agencies
6156251 the symptoms are there they sleep in school and their exam results are very poor
6156252 its their livelihood so the children will see it from there
6156253 the 18 and three deaconesses had their interviews and have been accepted by the church
6156254 we normally have about 20 people per day but in this case we were expecting 10 because we did not do any concrete awareness within the church
6156255 comparing the number of donors to the large crowd it is not much but we are fortunate to be included in the conference
6156256 for the past three years sai baba has won the award
6156257 we hope other religions will donate maybe in years to come we will be included or invited to attend other church conferences
6156258 there was a guy who came today but did not realise it was his birthday
6156259 it was only after we asked him to fill the form that he realised
6156260 commodore bainimarama agreed with and accepted the seven point communique on fiji and so told all the leaders present at the retreat
6156261 sir michael somare and i certainly did not pressure him into making those commitments to have elections next march as we and all the leaders are keen on helping fiji move forward but fiji has to play its due part
6156262 the leaders were looking forward to that in niue and that he chose not to do that is most unfortunate and disappointing
6156263 the report states there is no technical or managerial reason why the commitments to have election next march cannot be honored for an election next march the only thing that is lacking is the political will and what i am hearing is that there is no timetable for 2009 2011 2012 or any other time
6156264 there is also an exodus of the fiji labour party and ministers from the interim government
6156265 i dont know what the dynamics behind that fast changing unstable situation is
6156266 this is a very old building it was built in the colonial times it was the first weather forecasting office in fiji
6156267 no one was hurt in the incident and we managed to save the equipments he said
6156268 the other rooms were not burnt but they have been affected by the smoke and its not safe to go inside
6156269 if they are in the field as a minister or catechist then it will take five yeas of participating in an area of the church to come back into the church
6156270 they will have to work with the divisional superintendent and report to their leaders at their quarterly and annual meetings
6156271 he or she has to testify their faith and there must be reports from all the meetings
6156272 the reports of the meetings will have to be taken up at the annual conference where the members will see and vote on the official
6156273 if more than 50 per cent of the members vote in favour of the person then he will be accepted back into the churchs fold
6156274 the ministry of finance will be processing the payment ordered by the court of appeal
6156275 and this is one of the contributing factors to the low cane supply so farmers have had to look elsewhere and take up other options of harvesting to maintain a reasonable supply to the mill
6156276 the supply can be increased but because of the shortage of labourers and the bad road condition in cane farms the cane supply has been affected
6156277 when the labourers go home there is no cane cutting in the weekend until monday when the labourers return so supply is low in the beginning of the week
6156278 we are very happy with the mill performance and there has been no major breakdown for the past two months and that has helped the crushing season
6156279 the real power of an organization is that when you call on your members to act they act
6156280 package it associate it with your meeting and promote it
6156281 take every objection and answer it so the only end result is im too stupid to live if i dont come to your event
6156282 offer a guarantee you get a cash refund of your registration plus up to 500 in travel expenses if you dont get three things you can use out of the conference people say we couldnt do that we would have to give back a lot of money well then your conference stinks
6156283 it will take some time before we can fully eradicate all the plants in the area but we want this done
6156284 if the young people went missing for while or found not doing what they should be doing they will be asked where they were
6156285 we have been trying our best to eradicate marijuana farming in the area
6156286 young people thrive on planting and selling this to make fast money which is not good but many will say its easy otherwise they would have to resort to their root crop plantations
6156287 we have been working closely with police and are grateful to their assistance
6156288 we want to find out who are using our land to farm marijuana and sell it on the streets
6156289 there were 13 bands in the beginning and after an audition about four months back the seven best ones were chosen to compete it was difficult to get the bands together at first but it all came out well

6156292 theres nothing that has been shown in any objective way to create improvement for cellulite
6156293 what it describes as fraudulent medical devices that represent a waste of money
6156294 the agency determines whether a device temporarily reduces the appearance of cellulite through the use of a mechanical massager but doesnt evaluate the efficacy of any additional technology
6156295 the market for cellulite fighting equipment is expected to grow to 200 million a year by 2012 from 80 million last year

6156303 lindsay fell for sams protective nature telling friends shes the father i never had
6156304 they will report to the ministers who have being given additional portfolios
6156305 we need to be a society that accepts ex prisoners if we dont they are often left out
6156306 its not only up to ex prisoner themselves to change but us as members of society to contribute to the rehabilitation process
6156307 that has been the normal situation in waiyevo and they have managed to control the situation there and look after the patients well
6156308 we depend on the public works department for electricity supply and the supply to the waiyevo hospital has improved compared to past years
6156309 we were surprised to see that the hospital still experienced limited power supply because we have approved of a 24 hour supply
6156310 it is a concern that the hospital maintains the power supply has been limited so we will follow that up to verify the report
6156311 every prisoners compliant is taken serious because prisons are places where abuses are more likely to take place
6156312 but now with the new implementation and a change in the system prisoners grievances could be handled over the telephone
6156313 prison officers have been taken to task for abusing prisoners
6156314 i was told that 2000 was given to families who lost their houses to a fire and since i applied last year nothing has come through
6156315 the first time i applied the office in suva told me that it was all approved but no money has been given being a casual worker its not easy for me to look after my family
6156316 its not easy financing my familys needs especially when i am the only bread winner
6156317 that is why i am pleading with the department to release the financial help that is set aside for fire victims so we can rebuild our houses
6156318 records revealed at one stage majority of people arrested and jailed in fiji were from lau
6156319 when the yellow ribbon project was introduced we jumped on board and organised visitations and church services to listen to prisoners testimonies and also advised them
6156320 we want to lower the number of inmates and really help them to be good citizens
6156321 its not a place for them to live there forever but some place where they can learn small scale farming and move on in life
6156322 our personnel are working on it and it should be repaired soon
6156323 there is no disruption to services at the nadi or lautoka hospitals
6156324 as a result the school suffers exam results and academic focus decline teachers lose interest
6156325 teachers and students become demoralised and the student rolls fall
6156326 principals in fiji are expected to set the tone for the school determine the ethos maintain enthusiasm be industrious energetic and firm disciplinarians
6156327 school principals however are not given any specific training it is assumed they learn the job with experience
6156328 principals set critical level of expectation for their teaching staff they can motivate and inspire teachers to perform to their best of their abilities
6156329 the forum is inflexibly insistent in its demand that a general election be held in fiji in march 2009 come what may
6156330 the way i look at it we were not being very clear to the standards in prisons duties and poor facilities were also another factor
6156331 there was limited funding for major renovations and despite giving inmates something the prisons facilities was never up to standard
6156332 i was very good at the stick i came through that way of disciplining prisoners
6156333 i came through that teaching but i have learnt to accept the changes
6156334 if we gave them human treatment well get human treatment in return and a better understanding could be reached between wardens and inmates
6156335 even though the prison law books still emphasise a strict need to use sticks as reasonable force when required
6156336 firstly it is a big job to get him back with the system and get him to accept what has happened
6156337 you are sentenced to perform 20 hours community work under the supervision of the probation officer suva you must report to the probation officer within 24 hours of this sentence
6156338 the 20 hours must be performed within two months after completing your 20 hours work a report must be filled in court
6156339 a breach of the community work order makes you liable to prosecution or the cancellation of this sentence
6156340 i am disappointed that fiji is absent from the forum because it means a disengagement from dialogue
6156341 why are teachers being singled out to register and pay when providing a public service
6156342 there are a few issues that we need to iron out before to the see to the implementation of the trb
6156343 there is no specific time frame as to when this will come out the trb will focus on registering teachers from primary and secondary school level across the board
6156344 there is a time frame in place and teachers will have to be registered within that given time and there will be penalties if they do not register

6156354 theres a good team and good competitions to play i must confess i have lots of regrets but the coach took his own decisions and i respect it
6156355 i dont think i am a priority for him as a consequence i think this departure is the best thing for everybody
6156356 there was no flight available at that price and that price sounds very very low
6156357 the commander in chief must always listen to the commanders and not the latest opinion polls
6156358 americas future leaders must remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and thats where our military must stay
6156359 you live by a code and you fight for a cause and im honored to be your commander in chief
6156360 cannot be won however if we treat terrorism primarily as a matter of law enforcement law enforcement is an essential part of our strategy but our strategy cannot be limited to law enforcement alone
6156361 but eight years later al qaeda terrorists came back to finish the job
6156362 they used to stick them onto a rod that acted as a wick when you light the end of the rod it burns just as a wick dipped in paraffin does
6156363 we are not producing any fuel from jatropha because we do not have enough supply of seeds yet
6156364 when planting give the crops a spacing of about two by three metres weeding is done once in a while to stop the weeds from growing higher than the jatropha
6156365 we want to work as a team and deal with our past in a transparent manner we have to utilise all talents available

6156369 looking back over the past six years i dare say that i have witnessed momentous change in kenya the people have been changing the kenyan landscape in fundamental ways
6156370 and this change must be captured in the countrys basic law i want to seize this opportunity to once again assure my fellow kenyans that i am fully committed to a new constitution
6156371 i have envisioned a free country where democracy thrives at all levels in all my political life i have endeavoured to create space for the full expression of our peoples creativity passion and vitality
6156372 i therefore view the conclusion of our countrys constitution making as a pivotal collective objective that will entrench the freedom and openness that has begun to define our homeland
6156373 the road to a new constitutional dispensation has been long and sometimes bumpy in the national constitutional review conference at bomas of kenya kenyans gave their views regarding the content of a new constitution unfortunately political differences derailed the consensus building process and the proposed constitution did not get full acceptance of the kenyan people
6156374 a framework of human rights integrity accountability and diligent performance of public duties is in place we are in the process of legislating on the issues of inter ethnic and race relations as well as truth justice and reconciliation
6156375 it is true the ship sank near bukasa islands kalangala district but all its 15 man crew was rescued without any injuries
6156376 the report is therefore embargoed by this commission we will not allow the names to go public until we are satisfied and have verified all the information
6156377 ive no regrets whatsoever with the decision i made to represent england
6156378 a year ago when it was being talked about there were mixed thoughts running through my mind
6156379 i thought about it knowing i didnt get the opportunity to play for new zealand at the highest level
6156380 to get the chance to play at the highest level and test myself against the best players in the world is fantastic
6156381 you do get the odd one or two text messages saying what are you up to but the people who mean a lot are really supportive
6156382 one opinion in particular that i respect is kiwi hooker norm hewitts he sent a lovely e mail wishing me all the best and giving his blessing
6156383 he was a person i looked up to as a leader and a player when i first saw the e mail from him i thought oh heck he might say something about wearing the england jersey
6156384 on issues that divide us and the way to a lasting peace and reconciliation in our country
6156385 both sides have agreed that we should do all we can to make sure that no one hinders the delivery of aid to the needy
6156386 i am confident that once we have a schedule for ethiopian troop withdrawal a ceasefire will follow
6156387 what we need is the timely deployment of a robust un stabilisation force
6156388 these people amisom have become part of the problem and need to be replaced
6156389 facilitate the full withdrawal of other foreign forces from somalia and help create the conditions for lasting peace and stability there
6156390 what is the extension going to do it will not change the plight of the people
6156391 that hope is no longer there the violence the displacement and the atrocities are worse today than in june when the djibouti agreement was initialled
6156392 who said americans are leading the fight against terror on our soil all we have to do with the americans is what we call collaboration
6156393 its very difficult to date i just got kind of lucky
6156394 hes just a great guy hes awesome and really really talented
6156395 they can investigate me there is nothing wrong with that and if i have gone wrong somewhere there is a provision in the constitution and that should be followed
6156396 it is easier to see president kibaki than the chief justice i wonder how he thinks the problems in the judiciary can be solved when he doesnt want to talk to stakeholders

6156414 most of the counterfeits in tanzania use brand names they are also sub standard in quality
6156415 serious safety consequences for consumers hurt the economy and prevent the local manufacturing industry from growing
6156416 the worst part is you buy it cheap but actually its expensive because you pay for it several times over after it breaks
6156417 china remains the single largest source of fake products found in global markets
6156418 we want to send a message that tanzania is no longer a dumping ground for counterfeits
6156419 we are encouraging consumers to use their power like voting if they vote not to buy the goods then businesses will stop selling them
6156420 the existence of the culture of impunity in kenya and the need to remove this shield
6156421 there was organization and method to the violence the attacks and counter attacks were carried out with military discipline for example attackers in the rift valley participated in oathing ceremonies and donned a semblance of uniform their attacks anticipated the need to mobilise reserve forces to assist the main attackers
6156422 the violence was largely instigated by politicians throughout the campaign period and during the violence itself via the use of incitement to hatred
6156423 radio stations broadcasting in kalenjin languages as well as in the kikuyu language were culpable in this respect

6156446 instead of asking yourself whether you believe or not ask yourself whether you have this day done one thing because he said do it or once abstained because he said do not do it it is simply absurd to say you believe or even want to believe in him if you do not do anything he tells you

6156494 the welsh members of team gb led by cycling gold medallists cooke and thomas and rower tom james have done the nation proud and their triumphs in china have lifted our spirits during this damp welsh summer
6156495 we want people to turn out in their thousands to welcome home the athletes at the senedd event at midday on tuesday cooke pictured above is the first to confirm that she will be there and we are in touch with other welsh team members in the olympic village to make sure they know what a great welcome awaits them

6156500 i guarantee youll want one after youve seen the ad
6156501 it really is to find new uses of radio for advertisers who are continually asking us to demonstrate that our medium can successfully extend brands can successfully reach the consumer with touchpoints that are new and surprising
6156502 youll be hearing a song you hear homer go woo hoo and then youll go into another song

6156509 ein mitarbeiter ist durch eine glasscherbe leicht verletzt worden alle f nf w hrend des berfalls anwesenden kollegen sind schwer geschockt und wurden nach hause geschickt
6156510 in ihrer zerst rungswut nehmen es die straft ter in kauf dass mitarbeiter verletzt werden das ist einfach abscheulich hier sind leute am werk die ideologisch beschr nkt und verbohrt sind
6156511 staat und polizei werden sich nicht auf der nase herumtanzen lassen
6156512 es ist unglaublich dass wir so eine heterogene dom ne f r uns gewinnen konnten
6156513 corny verschaffte uns keine vorteile wir haben uns ganz regul r f r die party beworben

6156550 hagar finer ist uns bestens bekannt sie hat gegen regina halmich in ihrem abschiedskampf geboxt auch alesia graf und julia sahin hatten es nicht einfach mit ihr und sie hat sich in den letzten zwei jahren boxerisch deutlich verbessert
6156551 ich hatte zum gl ck seit langem mal wieder eine etwas l ngere boxpause und konnte mich richtig erholen nun bin ich hei auf den n chsten kampf
6156552 im rennen habe ich mich berhaupt nicht wohl gef hlt
6156553 vierter platz das ist der bl deste den man machen kann
6156554 ich schwimme gern gegen nichtbehinderte ich m chte nichts geschenkt bekommen
6156555 es w re gro artig wenn sie auch eine goldmedaille bekommen w rde
6156556 wir machen f nf mal die woche sport aber ab dem achten stockwerk habe ich schon gemerkt dass es schwierig wurde
6156557 die anmeldung ist vor ort ab 14 uhr m glich das rennen startet dann um 15 uhr
6156558 es bricht jetzt keine welt zusammen es ist nicht so schlimm wie das qualifikations aus bei der wm 2005 in helsinki irgendwie hat sich das alles in der saison schon angedeutet
6156559 wir haben berlegt was wir trinken gehen um ber das ergebnis hinwegzukommen
6156560 da k nnen und m ssen wir noch etwas draufpacken
6156561 die tatsache dass gegen ber den spielen in athen weniger dopingf lle entdeckt wurden ist der massiven anti doping kampagne der nationalen sportverb nde zuzuschreiben
6156562 dass mit blonska eine wiederholungst terin auftritt zeigt mit welcher dreistigkeit doping betrieben wird
6156563 der pool geh rt dir aber du darfst nicht nass werden
6156564 die testosteronspiegel sind hoch jeder f hlt sich zu jedem hingezogen
6156565 es gibt hier so viele fantastische frauen man wei gar nicht welche man zuerst ansprechen soll
6156566 laufen frauen rum die sich ganz sch n pr sentieren
6156567 es ist doch nur logisch dass sich bei so vielen gut aussehenden menschen welche m gen was fr her oder sp ter zu sex f hrt
6156568 man wei gar nicht welche frau man zuerst ansprechen soll
6156569 die testosteronspiegel sind hoch jeder f hlt sich zu jedem hingezogen

6156573 im sure our viewers would love to know how to go green
6156574 a knockout match down 2 1 against a great team with one of the best opposites and best setters in the world but we just found a way to win
6156575 blurb too often or include too many blurbs on your book and you might get called a blurb whore
6156576 es geht immer darum wie k nnen wir den deutschen fu ball insgesamt verbessern
6156577 ich habe mich ertappt dass die vorfreude schon wieder gro ist
6156578 die spanier haben ein passspiel wie beim schach ahnen permanent die spielz ge voraus und setzen sie perfekt um auch unter druck bewahren sie ihre technik sie sparen durch ihre spielweise kr fte
6156579 man muss ber ausbildungsinhalte reden wir werden sicher ber inhaltliche und personelle nderungen sprechen
6156580 auf der einen seite m ssen wir uns f r die wm qualifizieren und wollen uns den stress der relegationsspiele ersparen auf der anderen seite wollen wir weiter junge spieler integrieren das muss parallel laufen
6156581 man muss berlegen macht so eine reise sinn oder macht man mal einen l ngeren lehrgang
6156582 jedes l nderspiel hat auch eine gro e wirtschaftliche kraft da muss man abw gen
6156583 auf jeden fall wollen wir die leistungstests wieder mehr einflie en lassen
6156584 timo ist ein motivationsk nstler der fegt auf dem platz dazwischen auch verbal
6156585 das h tte dem jungen auch hier passieren k nnen
6156586 wir haben die letzten zehn spiele gegen f rth nicht gewonnen das wollen wir ndern unsere truppe will den dreier
6156587 wir m ssen disziplinierter und cleverer sein wollen die partie mit elf mann beenden andererseits brauchen wir weiterhin emotionen
6156588 davon zu reden halte ich f r verfr ht auch wir brauchen zeit uns zu finden und ich bin sicher in f rth werden wir wieder ein st ck besser sein als zuletzt
6156589 wenn ich mal zwei drei spiele hintereinander spiele und dann m glichst gut wird das meine chancen sicherlich verbessern
6156590 ich habe das zwar anders gesehen aber damit kann ich leben wenn man mir eine teilschuld an der niederlage gibt
6156591 daf r ist es jetzt noch zu fr h wir haben viele gute torh ter zur auswahl
6156592 es ist jetzt unsere aufgabe bis zur wm 2010 die drei besten torh ter zu finden die t r ist f r jeden offen in alle richtungen
6156593 viel mehr tut mir aber der hals weh vom reden und schreien ich habe nur zwei stunden geschlafen
6156594 seine frau wollte dass er hier siegt er hat es geschafft
6156595 ich wusste der junge ist der gr te k mpfer
6156596 wenn ich wieder zu hause bin fahre ich zuallererst an susanns grab
6156597 erst einmal mache ich urlaub dann will ich ein paar sprachen lernen
6156598 es st rzt viel auf matthias ein hoffentlich f llt er nicht in ein loch
6156599 ich verschwinde doch nicht nach einem olympiasieg ich bereite mich auf london 2012 vor und weltmeister bin ich auch noch nicht
6156600 aufh ren ich bereite mich jetzt auf london 2012 vor
6156601 wir sind heilfroh ber bronze bereits im trainingslager in tokio hatte er gro e probleme mit seiner reck bung
6156602 die punktrichter bewerten nicht immer objektiv manche meinen eben das sei reiner m dchensport und jungs h tten hier nichts zu suchen
6156603 frauen sind etwas gelenkiger ich habe daf r mehr kraft
6156604 aber die sind nach wenigen stunden wieder zum fu ball gegangen
6156605 das spielt keine rolle mehr sowohl f r die mannschaft als auch f r die trainer war das spiel nach einer analyse erledigt grunds tzlich muss man sagen dass wir eine schlechte leistung abgeliefert und dem hsv damit auf die spr nge geholfen haben es war das letzte spiel der saison und der hsv hatte bis zu diesem zeitpunkt nicht unbedingt viele tore erzielt es war aber auch das letzte spiel von huub stevens und ich denke dass die mannschaft ihm einen sch nen abschied bescheren wollte am ende haben sie sich in einen rausch gespielt den wir zugelassen haben
6156606 wir reisen mit einem punkt an und den wollen wir dann auch mindestens wieder mitnehmen
6156607 das war alles andere als einfach ich bin geschockt ich bin regelrecht geschockt ich bin so lange hinter dem weltrekord hergejagt
6156608 das ist eines der gr ten talente das ich jemals gesehen habe
6156609 der kam in badehose und joggingschuhen hat eine steigerung und einen start gemacht seine spikes angezogen und ist dann die 100 meter in 9 92 sekunden gejoggt
6156610 die springen auf ihrer insel herum wie sie wollen denen passiert gar nichts ich muss mich allein hier bei olympia an und abmelden f r den fall dass wir eine dopingkontrolle haben
6156611 die situation in unserer gruppe hat sich nicht ge ndert weil schon vorher klar war dass wir in den beiden kommenden spielen gegen nordirland und israel punkte holen m ssen
6156612 wir haben zu wenig pass sicherheit pass schnelligkeit und bewegung gezeigt insgesamt war es eine entt uschende leistung
6156613 ich wollte die flanke eigentlich auf unseren torwart zur cklegen doch dann habe ich den ball sehr ungl cklich getroffen
6156614 es w re das gr te gegen karlsruhe zu spielen
6156615 das wird ein ganz besonders spiel f r mich meine familie lebt noch in karlsruhe in der jugend habe ich f r den ksc gespielt es w re das gr te am wochenende zum einsatz zu kommen
6156616 so etwas kann passieren das spiel war trotzdem wichtig f r mich ich habe gesehen dass ich fast schon wieder bei 100 prozent bin
6156617 der umzug aus freiburg hat endlich geklappt so langsam kommt jetzt wieder etwas ruhe in mein privatleben in flottbek habe ich eine sch ne ruhige wohnung gefunden
6156618 vor eineinhalb jahren musste ich mich entscheiden f r welches land ich spielen m chte
6156619 der sieg letzte woche gegen bochum hat die arbeit der karlsruher in der vergangenen saison best tigt es wird definitv ein anderes spiel als beim letzten 7 0 sieg des hsv
6156620 wir haben alle leute in peking und kerner ist nun einmal ein ausgewiesener fu ballmoderator
6156621 momentan steht keiner zur verf gung dem man jetzt schon ein l nderspiel anvertrauen kann
6156622 das war kein thema wir sind froh dass kerner die strapazen auf sich nimmt
6156623 ich treibe viel sport trinke wenig alkohol und auf den dicken kissen im flieger kann man gut schlafen
6156624 bei den erheblichen kosten f r ein l nderspiel f llt ein solches ticket nicht gro ins gewicht

6156626 in the month of july i paid 120 pesos to minimally supply my apartment with groceries in august ive been paying approximately 170 pesos for the same products

6156632 when we walked in i was surprised to see dave there because they had literally four hours to prepare and he came out and you could see people were definitely sad
6156633 because i knew what was coming and he was like leroi today gave his ghost up and right then and there i started bawling
6156634 we will miss him forever its always easier to leave than to be left we appreciate yall being here it has not been a good day for us but theres nobody id rather be with than all my family up here on the stage
6156635 the most beautiful version of somewhere over the rainbow that i ever heard in my whole life
6156636 the first song i turned around to get a drink and i see a bunch of girls just wiping their tears genuinely crying
6156637 i can tell there was a big difference tonight the way the band was playing
6156638 ive met them drank with them whatever but it seems like they didnt want to be there but they were playing because they had that energy they wanted to make it real they wanted to play for leroi it was kind of bittersweet
6156639 which enables users to see the screen more clearly in well lit places even when used outdoors
6156640 ich war schon ersch ttert ber die bilder meiner weinenden jungs nach dem olympia aus ich h tte nicht gedacht dass sie das ausscheiden nach der vorrunde so trifft wir m ssen schon ein bisschen aufbauarbeit leisten
6156641 sie haben ja nicht ihre karriere verpfuscht es gibt noch viele weitere chancen f r sie mit der nationalmannschaft titel zu gewinnen
6156642 wenn es mit der medaille klappt wird die freude berwiegen

6156645 bis februar 2006 habe ich immer wieder beim theater vorgesprochen ich wollte unbedingt schauspielerin werden schlie lich wurde ich abgelehnt und war v llig am ende das war der tag an dem ich die stufen runtergefallen bin und mir den fu gebrochen habe meine eltern kauften mir eine gitarre um mich aufzuheitern da ich sonst nichts mit meiner zeit anzufangen wusste spielte ich drei wochen lang schrieb meine eigenen songs und nahm sie mit dem laptop auf irgendwie juckte es mich in den fingern ich musste etwas kreatives auf die beine stellen
6156646 it became much more important to make all these choices as a witting conscious consumer of life
6156647 and deeper than that there was a sense that if you did follow a traditional route
6156648 now it means choosing your breast size it might mean choosing the way your nose looks almost every discrete element of our lives now can be looked at as a consumer choice

6156677 the very act of voting itself is problematic in the same way that participating in warfare or in retributive punishment would be problematic for christians below the surface voting implies a devotedness that cannot mix the politics of the world with the politics of jesus
6156678 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

6156709 oh mighty obama we tremble at your wonderfulness please do not destroy the infidel mccain with one of your mighty thought blasts he is but a lowly mortal who does not comprehend your magisterial greatness
6156710 he can talk all he wants about britney and paris but i dont have time for that mess
6156711 the housing recession is not bottoming out by any standard the problem is actually getting worse
6156712 our biggest financiers are china russia and the gulf states these are rivals not allies
6156713 not since the great depression has there been a drop in value this huge
6156714 once you run current account deficits you depend on the kindness of strangers this might be the beginning of the end of the american empire
6156715 os hab is parado a pensar en lo absurdo de las advertencias contra la pirater a que hay en los dvds que compramos originales
6156716 en letras rojas y grandes y en un mont n de idiomas pero si pagas por el producto te los tienes que tragar doblaos
6156717 the anatomical biochemical and physiological development of a human being also starts early in fetal life and continues long after birth although the fetus is wholly dependent on the mother in order to survive the extremely premature infant is wholly dependent on its surroundings even a term baby is dependent on its surroundings in order to survive the concept of viability is therefore not as interesting as it seemed only some years ago it is the same human being whether it is an early embryo a fetus around midterm 20 weeks or pre term born after 23 25 weeks of gestation the human subject is completely helpless and dependent on its care givers for a long time from conception until late childhood the child is a whole separate human being from conception and throughout the full gestational period whether entirely spent in utero or not
6156718 suggestions or implications that a woman considering an abortion should be told anything about whether or not the fetus is a human being based upon whether the child is or is not of
6156719 i have traveled all around the world and have lectured in many different countries the laws of those countries vary widely in how those countries view human beings both born and unborn whether a particular adult person holds legal or moral beliefs that individual human beings should be treated with equal respect and dignity or whether there are justifications for treating them differently or be accorded degrees of respect may reflect the culture but those individual beliefs are totally irrelevant to whether or not it is a human being just because in one culture some adult human beings are not treated equally or not even given legal rights does not mean they are not human beings science is oblivious to such concepts
6156720 it defies all reason to suppose that the relative abilities of the adults or medical professionals at any one point in history or at any one place on earth external to the child determines if the child is a member of the human race
6156721 the point at which professionals can provide sufficient medical assistance to help a pre term baby to survive outside the mothers womb is essentially a study in the abilities of those in medicine not a statement of the essence or nature of the patient
6156722 the history of newborn medicine teaches us that the prognosis of sick newborn infants and especially pre term infants has been dramatically improved over the past century and even in recent decades it is impossible to know the extent of future developments that might lead to a human being able to live its entire post conception life apart from the mother

6156724 dakotafest was our first opportunity of the campaign season to engage in a public debate about the real issues of this campaign now south dakota voters will be denied the right to see us side by side and consider how senator johnson and i differ on various policies the senator is depriving south dakota voters of a traditionally important part of south dakota elections
6156725 theyre calculating that the public will not hold him accountable for their refusal to let him have that discussion in public and i think thats unfortunate i also believe its wrong
6156726 farmers are part of the solution to the energy problems in america and through increased production of renewable fuels we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil instead of exporting billions of dollars that supports hostile dictators who are trying to destroy america we can support south dakota farmers ranchers and land owners to produce renewable energy at home
6156727 prices for petroleum based products like diesel fuel and fertilizer are at record highs these higher input costs are taking much of the profitability out of the higher market value producers may be receiving for their commodities
6156728 the future of our industry is rooted within innovative distribution

6156738 mr gambari said mr ban ki moon will visit burma in the last week of december this year and he said this mr ban trip is only about political issue
6156739 however this doesnt mean that the regime has to sit pretty until december rolls around they do really need to show that they are willing to engage in reforms and to make that dialogue with mr ban meaningful they can for example release all political prisoners now and stop attacking people in eastern burma
6156740 i absolutely love downtown but times have changed ill still shop and eat here but for my industry and what i want to do to serve customers this is the right thing to do

6156742 african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population
6156743 by exposing these children to disproportionate rates of corporal punishment schools create a hostile environment in which these students may struggle even more
6156744 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
6156745 what made me so angry hes 3 years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school

6156769 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy so basically i had a prophylactic double mastectomies
6156770 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything i just wanted to kind of be rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
6156771 as well the proportion who reported becoming sexually active at a very early age decreased
6156772 however among those who were sexually active there was no significant change in the likelihood of having multiple partners or for males using condoms so while some adolescents have adopted measures to reduce their risks of sexually transmitted infection and unwanted pregnancy others report high risk behaviour
6156773 i worked so hard to become the champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6156774 im shocked i am still shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6156775 i dont think his training has given him enough speed endurance but eventually it will have and then i will be able to kiss my record goodbye
6156776 the victory over the georgian army should become for russia not a cause for euphoria and excessive joy but serve to speed up military transformations in russia
6156777 sorry ol chap but we dont seem to have an urgent need for magicians right at this very moment
6156778 ladies and gentlemen before your very eyes courtesy of the british army grudgingly the legendary the amazing the fantastic prestidigitations of that wizard of war jasper maskelyne see him hide the suez canal see him move alexandria harbor see him trick the desert fox himself rommel into believing that the entire british army was in the south when it was really in the north see him turn trucks into tanks and tanks into trucks and merchant ships into battleships see him change the face of war forever

6156780 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6156781 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6156782 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6156783 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6156784 hey were going to beijing i should pull my eyes back and take a picture because thats the first thing i think of when it comes to china
6156785 overall absence in tamesides primary and secondary schools for spring term 2008 was 6 25 per cent only 0 01 per cent below the english national average
6156786 the total absence for primary schools for this period is 5 2 per cent and total for maintained secondary schools is 7 35 per cent
6156787 by easter this year tameside had reduced its persistent absence in its priority schools by 39 per cent
6156788 the national average was 26 per cent therefore tameside is 50 per cent better than national average
6156789 tameside council will continue to address those pupils who hit the persistent absentee criteria in order to try and improve educational outcomes for everyone
6156790 i dont think we could have done it any better
6156791 i think as always they are very very good because all the elements of a successful bid are there on the day you can only hope for good weather and no catastrophes
6156792 there was very good community involvement if thats what theyre looking for we have it in abundance
6156793 because youve got to this stage youre already a winner youve already proved youre one of the best in britain thats an important thing to remember when you go back out into the community its communities that make in bloom as well as flowers and weve seen today a community thats growing together
6156794 due to great care being taken to verify and assess results
6156795 people living locally will become so disheartened if this carries on it amazes me that the highways agency can be so inefficient
6156796 having another set of exhibitions is a complete waste of time the evidence is plain to see for people living in our clogged up villages
6156797 the government need to step in and sort this out urgently
6156798 its such a huge undertaking were having to redo all the traffic modelling and the software that goes with that
6156799 that has knock on effects for other figures that have been supplied and the environmental effects and so on
6156800 im open every day except sunday my customers know they have a good service from me businesses just come in and leave their parcels for me i missed my lunch hour yesterday because a business had left me 50 parcels to post
6156801 you definitely feel theres some bloody mindedness here especially after we won the campaign to save edge lane post office in droylsden
6156802 people from all over use this post office the ashton academy is going to be built only 500 yards away with 1 300 pupils the shop is never empty
6156803 in addition to reducing our carbon footprint a positive consequence is a reduction in fuel consumption
6156804 it will take two years for the entire government fleet to be changed over in which time i would expect more noticeable reductions to occur
6156805 hes always on the patch of grass outside our house practising with a ball i have to almost literally drag him in when its dark
6156806 im really proud of him he said to me the other night if i make it mum ill buy you a new house but ive told him its just the start of a long long journey
6156807 he started playing with afc stanley aged just three and hes just joined celtic this season he absolutely loves it
6156808 he can play anywhere on the pitch at the minute
6156809 the awareness he has for a little lad is just phenomenal theres definitely something about him icici bank
6156810 some walk by and look the other way as if were not here
6156811 some make a beeline and come and see how were going
6156812 they try to get off the subject really when they come over they dont really want to get onto the deep and meaningful
6156813 it is very much a plantation friendly project and has been individually assessed to be climate change friendly
6156814 at the end of the day the company is looking for two bi products from the mill and they are the development of pulp and to generate electricity
6156815 with the overwhelming evidence of global warming we need to turn to other forms of energy such as solar and wind which will never run out
6156816 over the next 90 years the volume of wood is going to increase and eventually so will carbon storage
6156817 foresting has an incredible impact on the storage of carbon and is directly related to logging of old growth forest which never get the chance to grow back
6156818 the pulp mill is a criminal act and shouldnt be allowed to go ahead
6156819 the pulp mill is an example of bad environmental governance and should not proceed
6156820 ive sold virtually everything ive ever painted in the last three years its mad
6156821 ive been sending my work all over the world ive had people visiting the studio from as far away as california
6156822 ive got college students studying my work for exams ive even got fan mail
6156823 i paint landscapes and ive always had a fascination with old sheds thats how i ended up looking round the allotments
6156824 two years ago when i started no one was interested everyone thought i was batty
6156825 now i have all these emails from people asking me to go and visit their allotments
6156826 i never dreamed it would take off like this and now people are crossing me between beryl cook and lowry
6156827 it just shows you what you can do if you really believe in it and stick at it
6156828 it is important that we build as full a picture as possible of what happened during the pursuit of mr long and at the scene of the collision
6156829 i would urge anyone who saw any stage of the pursuit to contact us
6156830 propaganda attack against russia with the american news media leading the way
6156831 the news coverage has been far from fair and balanced especially during the first days of the crisis tskhinvali was in smoking ruins and thousands of people were fleeing before any russian troops arrived yet russia was already being accused of aggression news reports were often an embarrassing recitation of the georgian leaders deceptive statements
6156832 he was playing right on the waters edge kneeling down in the sand and as the water came in he got stung on his leg
6156833 a lady on the beach had some anti sting lotion and we put some of that on but he was still crying his eyes out as he was in such terrible pain
6156834 i wasnt sure about how he would react to any antibiotics and we still did not realise how dangerous it could have been it was only afterwards i found out that people have died from such stings
6156835 the one that stung thomas was blue with long tentacles apparently there have been more and more of them in the sea off the south of england over the last five years due to climate change
6156836 luckily after he was treated with lotion and an ice pack by the emergency doctor the blisters rash and swelling improved and he is fine now

6156869 reading and math are the only subjects tested by national exams so schools are desperate to have their students do well in those subjects
6156870 our students typically begin their information experiences in front of a global electronic library of billions of pages of information the internet where materials can be published by just about anyone on just about anything and for just about any reason
6156871 find information decode information evaluate information and organize information into personal data libraries
6156872 today just about all information is expressed in the universal language of numbers
6156873 compute basic mathematical skills understand the computer aided processing of numbers and to be able to process media
6156874 students must master a range of practical and technical skills involved in expressing ideas effectively and compellingly
6156875 as information becomes increasingly important to our economy and culture it also becomes more powerful able to accomplish enormous good and great harm
6156876 using information reliability and learning what a reliable source is and what is not
6156877 in the past education adapted the mind to a very restricted set of available media in the future it will adapt media to serve the needs and tastes of each individual mind
6156878 reading writing arithmetic is the no child left behind law leaving kids dumber
6156879 froebel postulated nurturing childrens mental facilities and curiosity for learning was most essential not imparting bits of information
6156880 growing plants are cultivated in accordance with natures laws so here in our child garden our kindergarten shall be the noblest of all growing things
6156881 research of high quality intensive early childhood education programs for low income children confirm lasting positive effects such as greater school success higher graduation rates lower juvenile crime decreased need for special education services later and lower adolescent pregnancy rates
6156882 state funded preschool improved the childrens score by 3 96 raw score points
6156883 all of a childs early experiences whether at home in child care or in other preschool settings are educational
6156884 when care is consistent developmentally sound and emotionally supportive there is a positive effect on the child and the family
6156885 i do not believe it should be required but it should be offered
6156886 i think it has more to do with the environment at home
6156887 it is hard to determine at such a young age
6156888 involves directing student attention toward specific learning in a highly structured environment topics and contents are broken down into small parts and taught individually it involves explanation demonstration and practice children are provided with guidance and structured frameworks topics are taught in a logical order and directed by the teacher
6156889 piaget asserted that for a child to know and construct knowledge of the world the child must act on objects and it is this action which provides knowledge of those objects
6156890 teaching methods which most american school children are familiar with teacher lectures demonstrations audio visual presentations teaching machines and programmed instruction do not fit in with piagets ideas on the acquisition of knowledge
6156891 laboratories workshops and technologies that encourage interactivity such as multimedia hypermedia and virtual reality fit in with piagetian thought
6156892 everybody knows where they are going and why the focus is on achieving a shared vision and all understand their role in achieving the vision the focus and vision are developed from common beliefs and values creating a consistent direction for all involved
6156893 in an effective school the principal acts as an instructional leader and effectively and persistently communicates that mission to the staff
6156894 the nea student program gives us a voice on the national level and strengthens our leadership skills inside and outside the classroom
6156895 our curriculum includes sol standards but it also includes other things above and beyond the standards of learning weve always served some students well she said were serving more students better now
6156896 i believe that the only true education comes through the stimulation of the childs powers by the demands of the social situations in which he finds himself
6156897 the most important action an effective teacher takes at the beginning of the year is creating a climate for learning
6156898 the school the family and the community are three major contexts in which students grow these overlapping spheres of influence are extremely important because they directly affect childrens learning and development
6156899 you cannot change the circumstances the seasons or the wind but you can change yourself that is something you have change of
6156900 the physical environment can influence the way teachers and students feel think and behave
6156901 rules this is your opportunity to set yourself up for a year of happiness or a year of grief the decision is yours
6156902 stimulating teaching has been described as entertaining motivating interesting and thought provoking nevin knoblock 2005 p 19
6156903 the hidden secret now revealed is that i received by far the better part of the bargain
6156904 mentors who assume the mentor role without adequately preparing themselves or their relationship are often disappointed and dissatisfied
6156905 participate in one learning module per semester modules address specific topics and needs expressed by new teachers

6157065 life long learning implies a buy in curiosity about life an insatiable desire to be alive in the now the future and immersed in the teeming life surrounding us every moment
6157066 students see our passions it gives them proof that we enjoy learning

6157081 computers are placed on small carts or desks with wheels so they can be moved to the area of need one strategy is to set up different workstations for students to use when working on a project access to a computer with an internet connection or cd rom capabilities may be one workstation and other resources can be available at other workstations students can rotate from one workstation to the next another strategy is for students who are using the computer to gather material they can print out the material and read it at a later time instead of trying to read it online
6157082 the carnegie commission on higher education concluded that technology should be the servant and not the master of instruction

6157097 jig saw think pair share three step interview roundrobin brainstorming three minute review numbered heads together team pair solo circle the sage and partners
6157098 the jig saw is when a group of students are placed together and each one is assigned a different subject and teaches the group members what they have learned about that matter think pair share is three step cooperative structure during the first step the students think silently about the issue the second step is allowing the students to pair up and exchange thoughts and or ideas and the final step the pairs share their responses with other pairs other teams or the entire group three step interview is when each team chooses another member to a partner then the individuals interview their partners by asking clarifying questions next the partners reverse roles and finally members share their partners response with the team roundrobin brainstorming is when the class is divided into groups of four to six and one person is responsible for recording a question is asked along with many answers and the students are given time to think about the answers during this thinking period the members of the team share responses with one another in a roundabout fashion the recorder writes all of the answers and then each person gives an answer until the time is up three minute review is when teachers stop any time during a lecture or discussion and give teams three minutes to review what has been said ask clarifying questions or answer questions numbered heads together is when a team of four each student being considered a number 1 2 3 4 and the teacher asks a question and then calls a number the number called is the student representing that number has to respond to the question but the group gets to confer with one another before answering team pair solo is when students do problems first as a team then with a partner and finally on their own circle the sage is when the teacher polls the class to see which students have a special knowledge to share the sages the teacher then has the rest of the classmates each surround a sage with no two members of the same team going to the same sage the sage explains what they know while the classmates listen ask questions and take notes all students return to their teams each in turn explains what they learned because each one has had a different sage they compare notes and if there is disagreement they stand up as a team and finally the disagreements are aired and resolved and partners is defined as the class being divided into teams of four and partners move to one side of the room and half of each team is given an assignment to master to be able to teach the other half partners work to learn and can consult with other partners working on the same material teams go back together with each set of partners teaching the other set partners quiz and tutor teammates team reviews how well they learned and taught and how they might improve the process

6157106 qualities of personal character play a significant role in the professional conduct of teacher
6157107 qualities of character as well as those of personality have a tremendous impact on the end result of successful education
6157108 teaching seems to be the sort of occupation in which professional effectiveness is greatly enhanced by the possession and exercise of personal qualities and practical dispositions that are not entirely if at all reducible to academic knowledge or technical skills
6157109 all they have to do is to conform to the standards of efficient instruction that the job requires our experiences undeniably prove that good teachers would be those who are not merely experts in some narrow academic or technical expertise but who have broad acquaintance with a wider range of received human wisdom teachers of character need to be well and widely educated persons themselves
6157110 in regard to standards of professional conduct when education is compared with other human service delivery professions such as medicine psychology and law a carefully conceived professionally recognized and enforceable code of ethics is conspicuously absent for example in psychology the american psychological association apa recently published the newest revision of the ethical principles of psychologists 2002 this code of ethics for psychologists describes the broad principles that guide professional practice and lists the decision rules psychologists must follow with regard to issues such as practitioner client relationships confidentiality test procedures and accuracy of public statements most importantly the code is enforceable at the state and national level states incorporate the apas ethical principles into their statutes and regulations and information about state disciplinary actions is transmitted to a national data bank in education professional standards of conduct are less clear cut than they are in other fields

6157112 it will not serve as a functional standard in cases of any ambiguity the code also fails to provide sufficient practical help for teachers when they address the real life hands on problems of their work
6157113 a review of statutes regulating teacher behavior reveals much variability among states regarding the clarity and enforceability of regulations with some states e g texas clearly identifying the teacher behaviors that are acceptable and unacceptable and others e g new york providing only broad generalizations about the professional responsibilities of teachers
6157114 formal ethical codes such as one established by the nea provide a foundation for ethical decision making but they also may leave teachers ill equipped to deal with the complexities of novel or unique problem situations teachers then need to develop strategies and skills for diagnosing ethical issues and making sound ethical judgments
6157115 the nea codes orientation and foundation are similar to those of the code of ethical conduct of the national association for the education of young children naeyc which draws from the ideas of aristotle kant hume mills and rawls
6157116 is not part of the code but is a personal acknowledgement of the individuals willingness to embrace the distinctive values and moral obligations of the field of early childhood care and education it is recognition of the moral obligations that lead to an individual becoming part of the profession
6157117 the naeyc code of ethics is recognized as providing focus and validation beyond ones personal philosophy and values this perspective provides a framework for the code heavily vested in beliefs and moral character as well as in rules the standards serve as a reliable moral touchstone to guide early childhood professionals in resolving practical ethical dilemmas
6157118 in any ethically demanding situation educators should bare into consideration whether the words will help or hurt and how those persons who are the subject matter of that communication will be impacted in both short and long term compassion always must trump ethical legalism if the teacher sincerely desires to assist students on the long road to becoming both better informed and eventually more truthful and fully self actualized persons
6157119 the authors administered a 34 item questionnaire of teachers perceptions of the frequency and seriousness of different categories of teacher misconduct to 235 school professionals factor analysis of the ratings of seriousness yielded 3 domains of ethical concerns
6157120 public school teachers view misconduct in the area of boundary violations as more serious than any other type of violation behaviors such as talking about personal subjects with students and talking to students about other students occurred frequently teachers rated boundary violations as the most serious but least common violations and carelessness in behavior as the most frequent but least serious violation
6157121 being an essentially good person with an intuitive sense of right and wrong doen not in itself equip the professional teacher to appreciate the layered nuances of classroom and school life in terms of their moral and ethical significance
6157122 codes communicate what society can and should expect from professionals that is where the educators turn when they must make a difficult decision especially when it is not obvious how they should balance the demands of their conflicting responsibilities however a relevant and explicit code of ethics is inadequate if left on the shelf using the code is a skill that can be learned through application teachers must develop proficiency in identifying ethical concerns techniques for discussing dilemmas and expertise in reaching solutions reflecting knowledge of the professions standards and ideals ethical practice cannot be left to intuition good will and feelings about what is right or wrong the code offers teachers valuable justification when they must choose a course that is right rather than one that is simply expedient
6157123 the educator shall not disclose information about students obtained in the course of professional service unless disclosure serves a compelling professional purpose or is required by law
6157124 in the past 20 years nationwide efforts to professionalize public school teaching include attempts to move from state certification to state licensure as a means of documenting training and competence increasing use of more rigorous post baccalaureate certification exams for prospective teachers and instituting increasingly rigorous requirements for continuing education for employed teachers no child left behind act of 2001
6157125 in every ethical situation several moral principles are at issue and need to be identified
6157126 it does not offer a philosophical justification of the fundamental ethical principles embedded in the code
6157127 naeyc recognizes that those who work with young children face many daily decisions that have moral and ethical implications
6157128 i hear and i forget i see and i remember i do and i understand
6157129 we learn taken from an old proverb 10 of what we read 20 of what we hear 30 of what we see 50 of what we both see and hear 70 of what we discuss with others 80 of what we experience personally and 95 of what we teach to someone else
6157130 i hear and i forget i see and i remember i do and i understand
6157131 learning is not a spectator sport students do not learn much just by sitting in classes listening to teachers memorizing pre packaged assignments and spitting out answers they must talk about what they are learning write about it relate it to past experiences and apply it to their daily lives they must make what they learn part of themselves
6157132 we learn taken from an old proverb 95 of what we teach to someone else
6157133 students are more willing to share their views in small groups and often develop deeper insights about the material than they would be working alone
6157134 between 1997 and 2000 the percentage of fifth graders passing the virginia standards of learning test increased from 35 percent to 65 percent in math 52 percent to 79 percent in science and 53 percent to 65 percent in english
6157135 the larger the class the more essential it is to use active learning
6157136 self fulfilling prophecy 2008 robert merton is credited with this term tauber 1998 he explained the five points involved
6157137 based upon these expectations the teacher acts in a different manner
6157138 the teachers treatment tells each student loud and clear what behavior and what achievement the teacher expects
6157139 if this treatment is consistent it will tend to shape the students behavior and achievement
6157140 with time the students behavior and achievement will conform more and more closely to that expected of him or her
6157141 whatever we expect with confidence becomes our own self fulfilling prophecy
6157142 treat a man as he is he will remain so treat a man the way he can be and ought to be and he will become as he can be and should be
6157143 require that all children count in school accountability measures so high expectations will result in high achievement for every child
6157144 there is nothing intrinsic to the students backgrounds or cultures that would prevent them from achievement
6157145 the adviser student and parent meet to discusss the students educational goals and develop a plan to meet them
6157146 it is important to realize that some vulnerable or at risk students nevertheless are more resilient than others and seem impervious to the deleterious impact of negative ee
6157147 clearly defining success in terms of individual progress is one means to avoiding inappropriately placed standards standards which may act to drive low expectancies placed on some students
6157148 an instructional approach in which students work together in groups to achieve learning goals
6157149 she needed to be able to put them in any combination without causing a problem and that she would like them to feel happier and more comfortable about working with anyone in the class
6157150 gifted education and cooperative learning a miss or a match
6157151 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have
6157152 when you dance you generate energy by the shaking of the ground
6157153 what we do very simply is to capture the movement of dancing people and transform it into energy
6157154 education would be so much more effective if its purpose were to ensure that by the time they leave school every boy and girl should know how much they dont know and be imbued with a lifelong desire to know it
6157155 how can we use those schools strategies to resuscitate failing institutions and to create better learning environments in general
6157156 an absence of meaning breeds low engagement in schoolwork and inhibits transfer of school learning to issues and problems faced outside of school
6157157 let us think of education as the means of developing our greatest abilities because in each of us there is a private hope and dream which fulfilled can be translated into benefit for everyone and greater strength for our nation
6157158 students learn more when they complete homework that is graded commended upon and discussed by their teachers
6157159 explain how new ideas in the current lesson relate to ideas in previous lessons
6157160 standardized tests are designed to rank students not to identify strengths and weaknesses of individual students
6157161 personal point of view is acknowledged and that they are given some level of choice in satisfying learning requirements
6157162 competence refers to the desire to be effective and successful
6157163 for the sake of learning without need for external comparisons
6157164 give students what they term busywork boring classrooms and classrooms with teachers who can not or will not explain information to students
6157165 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6157166 the focus remains on freddie mac and fannie mae and the financials in general
6157167 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6157168 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6157169 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6157170 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6157171 until that issue gets resolved youll continue to have that uncertainty and it will be hard for the market to make any progress in that atmosphere
6157172 to me the market has now recognized that oil services stocks and equipment stocks sold off more than they should have
6157173 now they are finally recognizing the strong fundamentals that those stocks have despite what the price of oil is on a weekly basis
6157174 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6157175 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6157176 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6157177 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6157178 the focus remains on freddie mac and fannie mae and the financials in general
6157179 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6157180 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6157181 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6157182 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6157183 proves again that management can deliver solid top and bottom line growth despite near term challenges
6157184 when you look across the planet things are different depending on where youre talking about
6157185 we didnt see much of a change in the third quarter from the second quarter
6157186 this time the company got a little help from the weak dollar
6157187 the company had strong tailwinds in europe and the asia pacific region
6157188 impressive in light of concerns that a stronger u s dollar would be negative for its international business
6157189 the company remains well positioned long term given its leadership in pc notebooks and emerging markets
6157190 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6157191 but the market has been having trouble holding onto these gains
6157192 the market wants some sort of resolution and the sooner the bail out the better it will be for the market until that takes place the market is not going to be comfortable
6157193 deposit pricing pressure has intensified while asset margin expansion has been muted as banks are all chasing the same low risk borrowers
6157194 our concern is that the second quarter margin uptick could prove ephemeral
6157195 i believe this is what some senate democrats were waiting for before deciding to strip lieberman of his committee chair next year
6157196 kick alternative energy production into high gear in the big apple
6157197 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6157198 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6157199 they have to do it a little more craftily than in the past but it wouldnt be too hard for them the conservatives to set a trap for the liberals
6157200 prime minister stephen harper can engineer the defeat of his government in 30 seconds
6157201 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6157202 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc qu b cois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately mr dion has indicated that the government has to be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
6157203 a lot of patience and because i struck at the right time
6157204 a bit of reform party hocus pocus so now harper is caught in that but not really caught
6157205 he wants to get the opposition especially the liberals to put up or shut up
6157206 and so this is a lot of posturing and chest beating on behalf of both harper and dion
6157207 i dont think the liberals can continue to play the same game
6157208 now that stage is over and mr dion is the one who has to make a tough decision
6157209 at the present time rep tubbs jones condition has stabilized and she is receiving the best care available
6157210 its everything readers can sense from the way a story begins and how it is placed on a page that it will be too long or too in depth for the time they have allocated to read the paper
6157211 some readers only want the breakout boxes so if they dont see any will skip the story its unfortunate but most readers today dont have the time or the inclination to read long stories or stories they know they should read but dont want to government meetings are an example
6157212 many americans only follow the news when something important occurs
6157213 most newspapers today shun stories that are written more than 25 inches the last place i worked they were demanded about 10 this is a huge difference from when i first started and we wrote long
6157214 and most newspapers today want breakout boxes a real person in the story boxes that explain contact information etc as a reader i like these things and have little time so i can understand the significance very well
6157215 honest fun neighborly intelligent in the know and more in touch with the values of readers
6157216 they react very badly to being talked down to but they also dont want to be bored to tears by stories that are not well told stories that are of no interest to them in the first place
6157217 print is often described as a lean back medium youre sitting in your own bubble of time often relaxing and paging through a limited and defined product that mixes news and advertising but in a way that allows you totally ignore one or the other
6157218 now consider online a lean forward medium that is all about doing things clicking linking scrolling along come ads that pop up on your screen or leap about or are garish and can be intrusive ads havent been integrated smoothly yet online the way they mostly have in print
6157219 tend to be single copy buyers at double the rate of white readers so making the paper easily accessible is priority
6157220 the hardest part was getting information from all of the departments to create
6157221 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6157222 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6157223 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6157224 the focus remains on freddie mac and fannie mae and the financials in general
6157225 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6157226 everything in this life was irrelevant social justice as well as debauchery
6157227 i simply do not have time for that do i
6157228 offer no prevention plan it is clear where they are coming from abstinence programs are ineffective prevention programs must be evidence based which is code language for programs that
6157229 prime example of what has gone very wrong when it comes to preventing hiv aids
6157230 encourage and support youths in their decision to abstain from sex have been evicted from d c public schools
6157231 effective hiv aids prevention strategy can be devised as long as d c politicians and school officials
6157232 policies that look at what is best for all d c children and families
6157233 revealed some surprising differences in opinion among parents of teenage daughters
6157234 they appear to be less worried than other parents about teenage pregnancy and slightly less supportive of sex education
6157235 evidence based clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly trauma patients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
6157236 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
6157237 however it may be difficult to change attitudes of age bias and may require a broad societal campaign nevertheless it may be possible to address this problem without directly addressing age bias a focus on retraining the providers about triage protocols may be sufficient
6157238 additionally it may be helpful to highlight the literature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias
6157239 we use the word bias in certain areas of our study but we also talk about blind spots
6157240 people are operating on assumptions of what old is and what elderly patients need
6157241 trauma is often seen as a disease of the young
6157242 thats changing you have a fairly active aging population that is playing sports being active and getting injured
6157243 w e want to share the results with other states and ems systems because if its happening in maryland its likely happening everywhere
6157244 we tell you the good news what god promised our fathers the jewish patriarchs and people he has fulfilled for us their children contemporary jews by raising up jesus

6157253 the olympic games serve as an apt metaphor and occur at an appropriate time to remind the nations educators and parents that we need to acknowledge this widespread problem and work harder to engage boys in reading
6157254 boys have trouble reading because they dont get to read for a purpose that makes any sense to them
6157255 as a society we need to make more of an effort to connect boys with many different kinds of reading both at home and at school
6157256 if we can expand the notion of what reading is well have a better chance of inspiring boys to want to be readers this means broadening our definition of reading to include boy friendly nonfiction humor sports comics graphic novels action adventure magazines websites and newspapers boys need to know that these materials count as reading
6157257 we can help boys become readers by giving them a reason to want to become readers
6157258 this approach opens the door and the mind once a boy starts reading he will be more receptive to many other types of reading over his lifetime

6157267 some of our elected leaders have forgotten that they were elected by south floridians and not the special interest groups lining their coffers

6157269 we will have the resources necessary to ensure that south floridians are well informed of how the actions of their representatives are affecting their personal finances and families

6157275 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
6157276 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
6157277 i realized there was a lack of material in this area
6157278 i also wanted to enhance reading abilities while providing enjoyment which is very important

6157295 i dont expect to win this race my goal is to finish ill probably end up crawling across the finish line but ill do it
6157296 some of our elected leaders have forgotten that they were elected by south floridians and not the special interest groups lining their coffers

6157322 i dont want to disrespect marcs name he is a fantastic manager and genuinely believes in rihanna but he uses her money to fund her future projects because he believes he can break her in the world market her album sales are not nearly as close to her single sales and he knows that if she is only known as a singles artist she will only be as good as her last hit unfortunately he didnt inform his client and im receiving the brunt of it
6157323 then came for the repackaging of her album good girl gone bad which is called good girl gone bad reloaded that entire project was funded through rihannas money take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account

6157339 this week the uk prime minister tony blair stood down and to celebrate the fact we might see a little less of his grinning murderous face we at pandaz pop are giving out this preview of the video to the forthcoming double a side single from plans amp apologies
6157340 at the present time rep tubbs jones condition has stabilized and she is receiving the best care available
6157341 kick alternative energy production into high gear in the big apple
6157342 well its not clear yet but you might just see me there
6157343 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6157344 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6157345 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6157346 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6157347 the market has changed quite a bit since then inflation and interest rates are climbing and shares of indian builders home price appreciation and demand for land are slowing of course this might be a good time to jump in and pick up land at distressed sale prices but he will be competing against established players
6157348 some of the products have been associated with that investigation
6157349 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6157350 we are closely monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the canadian food inspection agency
6157351 has stabilized and she is receiving the best care available
6157352 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6157353 sen mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6157354 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6157355 way more than what the market was looking for and as a result we have come off our highs
6157356 you are just picking up some extra cargos that are just getting counted
6157357 we generally do work off inventories at this time of year a draw is not unusual
6157358 what we are seeing is a global slowdown in the economy and that is contributing to the weaker demand numbers that we have seen
6157359 that concept is starting to change these high prices are having an effect on global growth and it will slow down demand going forward
6157360 now people are looking at the market with more reality
6157361 confidence in the war on terror and on the situation in iraq is at the highest level of the last four years
6157362 who would have thought a year ago iraq would not have been an absolute lay down issue for barack obama
6157363 now accept drilling as a necessary evil for the lack of a better phrase
6157364 the biggest thing that changed the race was john mccains call for offshore oil drilling
6157365 it is not about offshore drilling per se but people are looking at the price of gas as the driving force in all conversations about the economy and the fact that john mccain was looking for a new policy that was aggressively trying to find new energy was a positive economic policy
6157366 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6157367 we have to stop people from taking the road to militancy the biggest flaw with musharrafs policy was that he had placed too much emphasis on the military strategy alone how can you win against your own people and that too when they are opposed to you so strongly
6157368 reorienting the war on terror was necessary for the army as well the army has fought in the border area for six years and they havent been able to curb the militants maybe it is time to win hearts and minds of local people and make them your allies
6157369 im shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6157370 i ran the corner as hard as possible and once i hit the straight i told myself to keep it up the 200 medal has been my dream
6157371 its ridiculous hes doing it and making it look so simple
6157372 when michael johnson did it it didnt look that easy youve got to understand youre back there giving it everything you have and this guy is just doing it its brutal
6157373 usain bolt is a super human being the world has never seen anything like him
6157374 investigation in ahmedabad blasts case has revealed that the accused persons are members of simi and some accused in this case have also been arrested in 2001 in surat under the provisions of unlawful activities prevention act
6157375 the said information has been made available recently by gujarat government to the centre
6157376 if simi is not banned it would reorganise its activists members who are still absconding disrupt the secular fabric of the country by polluting the minds of the people by creating communal disharmony and propagate anti national sentiments

6157382 a powerful tool to review huge quantities of documents efficiently thoroughly and accurately
6157383 every time the conversation turns to windows 7 the subject of winfs comes up
6157384 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6157385 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6157386 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6157387 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6157388 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6157389 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6157390 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6157391 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6157392 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6157393 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6157394 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6157395 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6157396 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6157397 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6157398 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6157399 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6157400 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6157401 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6157402 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6157403 who are open to doing something on the production side
6157404 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6157405 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6157406 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6157407 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6157408 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6157409 we have a facebook account and we get all kinds of story ideas that come through that
6157410 thats probably been one of our biggest tools for recruiting and getting people registered to our website and getting story ideas and stuff

6157412 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6157413 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6157414 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6157415 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6157416 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6157417 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6157418 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6157419 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6157420 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6157421 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6157422 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6157423 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6157424 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6157425 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6157426 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6157427 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6157428 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6157429 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6157430 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6157431 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6157432 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6157433 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6157434 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6157435 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6157436 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6157437 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6157438 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6157439 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6157440 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6157441 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6157442 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6157443 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6157444 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6157445 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6157446 education is my passion and its the key ingredient in changing sacramento so it can be the world class city we know it can be
6157447 gavin newsom is the most interesting and intelligent new face in california politics since i moved here in 1991 and maybe in the last three decades
6157448 he is bold and fearless and does big things im delighted to bring my gubernatorial campaign experience to his race for governor
6157449 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6157450 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6157451 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6157452 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6157453 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6157454 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6157455 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6157456 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6157457 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6157458 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6157459 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6157460 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6157461 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6157462 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6157463 my wife says i look boring i think i look professional and modern
6157464 my boss says i come across as cool and distant i think i look reliable and friendly
6157465 does my long red hair look good on me or would i look better with a short blond cut
6157466 when web hosting was recently migrated to a new provider
6157467 we think the exposure is minimal but we certainly would not want to risk any of our student information being exposed to a security breach
6157468 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6157469 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6157470 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6157471 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6157472 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6157473 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6157474 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6157475 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6157476 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6157477 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6157478 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6157479 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6157480 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6157481 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6157482 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6157483 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6157484 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6157485 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6157486 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6157487 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6157493 but i think the changing of the times make them different when we played the manager had more freedom leo didnt worry about stepping on anybodys toes but lou still gets the cooperation of the players hes not afraid of kind of letting a player know that he has to have production from him
6157494 hell say whatevers on his mind if you play hard he wont say anything to you i think as long as you do your job every day youll be fine hell play you hell talk to you hell yell at you hes kind of harsh but hell play whoevers getting the job done hes not afraid
6157495 i took my eight swings and i turned around and threw the bat at the backstop he just stood there

6157497 thats the way he was and thats the way lou is its amazing how they can get the best out of you
6157498 finally somebody would say youre talking about me even though leo hadnt said a word
6157499 and hed turn and say yes im talking about you
6157500 a lot of people looked at leo and said he was leo the lip and he was bad but we had a lot of fun
6157501 he had a lot of fun with his players and lou has a lot of fun
6157502 everybody respected him but you didnt like him everybody respects lou and i think everybody likes him

6157545 what do we want in documentmode how do we ensure reworking

6157552 has declared that the deployment of elements of us strategic abm missiles in the czech republic and poland clearly demonstrates the anti russian aim of the us global missile defence system

6157573 new yorks delegation to the democratic national convention will vote to nominate sen
6157574 has accepted a speaking role on the final night of the democratic convention appearing on the same stage that barack obama will officially receive the democratic partys presidential nomination
6157575 the obama campaign is doing its best to co opt the rallys legacy in its effort to reinforce the notion that the charismatic centrist black politician is operating in the tradition of civil rights leaders past
6157576 belief that a single individual can transform society has clouded the vision of contemporary pundits voters and even activists in this election year
6157577 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what he is up against right now
6157578 obama needs to own the branding of john mccain the man
6157579 hillarys job is to bring a casserole dish and to serve it with a smile
6157580 obamas job is to carry luggage fetch lemonade shine shoes and smile broadly while saying dmi poll majority of middle class supports progressive policies think progress
6157581 obama has done everything he can to reassure the nations ruling bipartisan political class that he is fully on board with the american empire project
6157582 deserves to lose iraq as an issue working in his favor
6157583 it will be important for progressively inclined citizens and activists to understand that it was corporate imperial centrism not the left and not the people that got defeated
6157584 it does appear that the current president has been faithful to his wife yet george bush has committed every transgression imaginable against the u s constitution and has behaved faithlessly towards to the citizenry he is sworn to protect

6157594 the position of the government is very clear we will not support
6157595 tenemos el acuerdo de la mayor a para aprobar el proyecto ma ana en el recinto
6157596 la intervenci n quir rgica a que se someti la actora era sin fines terap uticos sino para procurar el perfeccionamiento f sico de la persona
6157597 pod a realizarla en otra oportunidad en que no interfiriera con sus labores
6157598 en octubre de 2005 la actora notific en forma verbal a la empleadora que ten a la intenci n de realizarse un implante mamario hecho que luego fue notificado mediante el telegrama del 16 de noviembre del mismo a o por el cual tambi n le hac a saber que desde el 23 11 2005 al 30 11 2005 se realizar a la mencionada intervenci n es decir que la empleadora ten a pleno conocimiento de que la actora se iba a ausentar de sus labores durante el plazo se alado
6157599 para que justificara sus inasistencias y retomara tareas dentro del plazo de 24 horas y finalmente el d a 30 de noviembre de 2005 decidi el despido
6157600 el despido decidido por la demandada resulta injustificado y contrario a derecho atento que ten a cabal conocimiento de las razones por las que la actora no concurr a a prestar tareas por lo que mal pod a invocar abandono de trabajo
6157601 resulta irrelevante que la demandada entendiera que la cirug a a la que se someti la actora era innecesaria porque en definitiva se trata de un hecho que integra la zona de reserva o de privacidad de la trabajadora que debe ser respetada por el empleador

6157609 eso corresponde saber a los propios congresistas si es que van a asumir una posici n responsable en torno a la situaci n que actualmente se est viviendo o van a insistir en una propuesta que ha sido evidentemente vulneratoria de los derechos ind genas e impuesta de manera antidemocr tica
6157610 se est cambiando todo el r gimen de protecci n que existe para los territorios de las comunidades para convertir sus propiedades que antes ten an consideraciones especiales en una propiedad fr gil que puede ser vulnerada por t tulos de particulares que aunado a todo un conjunto de normas demuestran que hay una clar sima voluntad de desaparecer a las comunidades como realidad jur dica
6157611 en la era republicana se consideraban a estos territorios inalienables e imprescriptibles porque eran propiedades especiales que no estaban sujetas al juego del mercado sin embargo la constituci n de 1993 cambi ese marco normativo dej ndolas abiertas de que entren al mercado entonces lo que se est haciendo en el fondo es continuar con las reforma del fujimorismo y radicalizarlas

6157618 i deeply regret that a fortnight later you have failed to act in this matter or to apologise for the severe distress that this disgraceful campaign has caused
6157619 it is simply unacceptable for the conservative party to fail to address the very serious matters that have been raised as a result of this case

6157626 charlottesvilles city council was nearly split down the middle monday when considering approval for a temporary construction easement to build the meadowcreek parkway the controversial 2 mile thoroughfare that has stagnated for nearly four decades
6157627 because of some final design things having to do with the storm water ponds theres some tinkering with some boundaries
6157628 i do think for where we are now this is an important road
6157629 im proud that our city council has been outraged by some abuse of historic properties in the past
6157630 im disappointed that i do not see that same level of protection of the historic property that is mcintire park
6157631 if i were asked what legacy i would like to leave our great grandchildren its something thats disappearing over time and thats our green space
6157632 this parkway has gone from a bad idea to a monstrosity
6157633 doctors may not refuse medical treatment to gay men or lesbians for religious reasons the california supreme court unanimously ruled monday

6157635 leroi moore the versatile saxophonist whose signature staccato fused jazz and funk overtones onto the eclectic sound of the dave matthews band died tuesday of complications from injuries he suffered in an all terrain vehicle accident the band said he was 46
6157636 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6157637 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6157638 like every albemarle county public school the community public charter school opens its doors today unlike the other schools however the new middle school has no detentions no suspensions and a curriculum infused with the arts
6157639 the primary impulse came to be able to provide an opportunity for young people to attend a school that was a public school that offered the enriched potential that private schools offer
6157640 its a place for kids who struggle in some way and dont fit into the larger school
6157641 infusing arts really makes learning more enjoyable but also more thorough
6157642 arts is a vehicle that gives relevance to their learning
6157643 the kids will learn the material but theyll learn it in a different way
6157644 our school is about thinking outside the box and finding different ways to approach learning and teaching
6157645 choice theory is the idea that students can learn and take responsibility for themselves
6157646 what choices can you make to keep your learning growing
6157647 its four things that we believe encompass what we need our students to do to be successful here
6157648 you try to get the student to come closer in you made a bad choice were going to help you make a better choice
6157649 we are going to have to turn away people next year
6157650 last month doctors who perform abortions in south dakota had to start reading a state mandated script to their patients
6157651 the abortion will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
6157652 our position is that so long as we provide the information thats mandated by the statute were free to say anything else we want to say so long as we dont dispute objective scientific facts
6157653 i have no idea its very difficult to answer your question without first determining whether they are complying with the statute
6157654 im not sure i want to share that information with you
6157655 if i was a lawyer representing one of these doctors id offer the following sound legal advice read the statute to your patient its like the police issuing a miranda warning
6157656 the relative risk of mental health problems associated with abortion compared to its alternatives
6157657 the majority of studies suffered from methodological problems often severe in nature
6157658 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy
6157659 the rallying cry wait till next year doesnt apply to the olympics
6157660 i wish i couldve invited all of you but i have some pictures and video i can show you when season 6 starts on september 8 i cant wait to see them too it was all a blur

6157669 elanco remains committed to using science to address the growing need for safe affordable food and to choices for consumers retailers and producers
6157670 in april it was reported that the fbi had been focusing on as many as four suspects
6157671 confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
6157672 i was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this is not spin this is not true
6157673 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
6157674 suppressed important evidence and whistleblower testimony that challenged the official story on many fronts
6157675 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
6157676 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
6157677 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators
6157678 researchers are finding clues to the basis of brilliance in the brain
6157679 and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years
6157680 i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me
6157681 but as the days of noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh
6157682 who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing
6157683 stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still selah
6157684 let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him
6157685 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun
6157686 i said what are you doing in my house he just kept saying he didnt do it
6157687 i just hope i broke up the burglary ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here
6157688 this is a weapon its used for self defense you certainly dont use it on a child
6157689 the kids had access to this stun gun because it was left on top of the refrigerator by the mother
6157690 and after further investigation we learned that it was used as a disciplinary tool
6157691 the first time the young girl said it tickled a little bit
6157692 but the second time it had a little more pain and she cried
6157693 when it was all said and done she hopkins was remorseful about even using it to threaten the children
6157694 i dont think she meant any harm toward them but it was the effect of it
6157695 it is a cause for regret that at a time when we are already in a difficult situation the american side further exacerbates the situation in relations between the united states and russia
6157696 the team has worked extremely hard and we are very appreciative of the support we receive from area businesses this is a small way of personally thanking them for all they do for our program
6157697 i dont think that they are right i dont think that its about a womans right to choose the choice that you have is whether or not to have sex and what protection you use and if you do choose to do that then you need to accept whatever consequences that might happen such as getting pregnant now thats my rant for the day

6157700 the pain of rejection is real it registers in the same place in the brain as physical pain
6157701 i helped with the baby then i went to the christening and the first birthday party
6157702 she wasnt interested in the fact that i was looking for a job
6157703 money for me was tight and she said well have to have you over for dinner it never happened the only communication was if i reached out to her
6157704 i have a new philosophy i dont believe in these one way friendships
6157705 you dont get anything out of them you wind up getting really hurt if somebody is giving me signals that i outgrew our friendship or i dont have time for you i pick up on that and cut them out of my circle
6157706 shes content with the pattern she knows youll phone first
6157707 some people at certain times in their lives have less energy to put into a friendship
6157708 it is important to try to sort out if the other person is generally less available or if its specific to this friendship if its more general then you have to decide if you can live with the more limited time and energy that this friend brings
6157709 at first we had a fast and furious friendship we were really tight
6157710 i thought thats how stacey is and i accepted it
6157711 she should have been checking in on me and i shouldnt have to be chasing her
6157712 this is who i am friends of mine have to accept it or they move on
6157713 it seems like the friendship is over because i havent talked to her in a year ive got to let it go it gets to me
6157714 who knows maybe ill pick up the phone and call her one day when im in the mood i miss her
6157715 i notice im the one whos always calling to get together i need to check out with you if i am looking for more time to get together than you would really like or if we have a style difference here
6157716 you can write out what you want to say and look at it in the morning it allows you to say what you want without being interrupted it also allows time for the other person to respond and think about what the email said very often the friendship comes out stronger than it was to begin with
6157717 if we are feeling more and more left out hurt disrespected it behooves us to begin to look elsewhere for the mutuality and connection that we all need to survive
6157718 i cant see you anymore because i need a more reciprocal relationship
6157719 court rules saudi arabia cant be held liable for 9 11

6157722 more than anything else i remember my sweat ive never sweated so much in my life dont ever let anyone tell you high humidity isnt a contributing cause of murder
6157723 its about people who take their frustration out on everyone around them i never raise my voice cutting myself or hurting myself is the way i deal with anger
6157724 im so effing deep because i cut myself to make me forget the pain of the world
6157725 in terms of the s word that does not enter my mind and it never has done in terms of an attempt because i am stronger than that i might be a weak person but i can take pain
6157726 ich stehe vor der t r und klopfe an wer meine stimme h rt und die t r ffnet bei dem werde ich eintreten und wir werden mahl halten ich mit ihm und er mit mir
6157727 vater im himmel mir ist klar geworden dass ich mein leben selbst bestimmt habe und von dir getrennt bin vergib mir meine schuld danke dass du meine s nden vergeben hast weil christus f r mich gestorben und mein erl ser geworden ist herr jesus bitte bernimm die herrschaft in meinem leben und ver ndere mich so wie du mich haben willst
6157728 bittet dann wird euch gegeben sucht dann werdet ihr finden klopft an dann wird euch ge ffnet
6157729 durch ihn haben wir die erl sung die vergebung der s nden
6157730 denn das reich gottes ist nicht essen und trinken es ist gerechtigkeit friede und freude im heiligen geist
6157731 petrus antwortete ihnen kehrt um und jeder von euch lasse sich auf den namen jesu christi taufen zur vergebung seiner s nden dann werdet ihr die gabe des heiligen geistes empfangen
6157732 der dieb kommt nur um zu stehlen zu schlachten und zu vernichten ich bin gekommen damit sie das leben haben und es in f lle haben ich bin der gute hirt der gute hirt gibt sein leben hin f r die schafe joh 10 10
6157733 und das zeugnis besteht darin dass gott uns das ewige leben gegeben hat und dieses leben ist in seinem sohn wer den sohn hat hat das leben wer den sohn gottes nicht hat hat das leben nicht dies schreibe ich euch damit ihr wi t dass ihr das ewige leben habt denn ihr glaubt an den namen des sohnes gottes
6157734 jeder der glaubt dass jesus der christus ist stammt von gott und jeder der den vater liebt liebt auch den der von ihm stammt wir erkennen dass wir die kinder gottes lieben wenn wir gott lieben und seine gebote erf llen denn die liebe zu gott besteht darin dass wir seine gebote halten
6157735 euer leben sei frei von habgier seid zufrieden mit dem was ihr habt denn gott hat versprochen ich lasse dich nicht fallen und verlasse dich nicht hebr 13 5
6157736 denn uns ist ein kind geboren ein sohn ist uns geschenkt die herrschaft liegt auf seiner schulter man nennt ihn wunderbarer ratgeber starker gott vater in ewigkeit f rst des friedens
6157737 aber du betlehem efrata so klein unter den gauen judas aus dir wird mir einer hervorgehen der ber israel herrschen soll sein ursprung liegt in ferner vorzeit in l ngst vergangenen tagen
6157738 die zeit ist erf llt das reich gottes ist nahe kehrt um und glaubt an das evangelium mk 1 15
6157739 er war gott gleich hielt aber nicht daran fest wie gott zu sein sondern er ent u erte sich und wurde wie ein sklave und den menschen gleich sein leben war das eines menschen er erniedrigte sich und war gehorsam bis zum tod bis zum tod am kreuz
6157740 wir haben ja nicht einen hohenpriester der nicht mitf hlen k nnte mit unserer schw che sondern einen der in allem wie wir in versuchung gef hrt worden ist aber nicht ges ndigt hat
6157741 ich bin der weg und die wahrheit und das leben niemand kommt zum vater au er durch mich
6157742 denn auch christus ist der s nden wegen ein einziges mal gestorben er der gerechte f r die ungerechten um euch zu gott hinzuf hren dem fleisch nach wurde er get tet dem geist nach lebendig gemacht
6157743 gott aber hat seine liebe zu uns darin erwiesen dass christus f r uns gestorben ist als wir noch s nder waren
6157744 diesen jesus hat gott auferweckt daf r sind wir alle zeugen
6157745 das evangelium von seinem sohn der dem fleisch nach geboren ist als nachkomme davids der dem geist der heiligkeit nach eingesetzt ist als sohn gottes in macht seit der auferstehung von den toten das evangelium von jesus christus unserem herrn
6157746 da er ihn aber von den toten auferweckt hat um ihn nicht mehr zur verwesung zur ckkehren zu lassen hat er so ausgedr ckt ich will euch die heilsgaben gew hren die ich david fest zugesagt habe
6157747 euer herz lasse sich nicht verwirren glaubt an gott und glaubt an mich
6157748 allen aber die ihn aufnahmen gab er macht kinder gottes zu werden allen die an seinen namen glauben
6157749 denn aus gnade seid ihr durch den glauben gerettet nicht aus eigener kraft gott hat es geschenkt nicht aufgrund eurer werke damit keiner sich r hmen kann
6157750 ich stehe vor der t r und klopfe an wer meine stimme h rt und die t r ffnet bei dem werde ich eintreten und wir werden mahl halten ich mit ihm und er mit mir

6157752 by entering new markets especially alt a and subprime and guaranteeing more of our customers products at market prices we met our goal of increasing market share from 22 to 25 percent
6157753 in 2006 and early 2007 the industry many analysts and market observers were generally not predicting a downturn in the housing and credit markets to the magnitude of what has since emerged and outlooks for particular market segments at that time varied significantly
6157754 was more conservative in its approach and the loans have continued to perform better
6157755 i hope you had a fantastic time at the holiday party i sure did and my feet still hurt thank you for making the party a blowout
6157756 a time when we began to put a difficult past behind us and also to build for the future
6157757 we engaged in the subprime market for the first time closing deals to guarantee and securitize subprime loans with help from the new facility that allows us to sell off the riskiest layers
6157758 approached its expansion of this business cognizant of the relatively weak credit performance of recent subprime originations which were affected by issues relating to underwriting quality home price de appreciation and risk layering
6157759 however management expects improvement in the quality and credit performance of subprime mortgages originated this year
6157760 by the most severe decline in home prices since the great depression

6157781 a different uniform other than the regular one may be recommended for these police officers
6157782 its true we live inside the atmosphere of the sun
6157783 if were going to live inside the suns atmosphere we need to learn more about it especially how to predict the storms
6157784 were going to launch a fleet of weather stations spacecraft that observe different aspects of suns atmosphere
6157785 solar activity is a bit like a puppet show if you want to understand the motion of the puppets you need to see the strings on the sun the invisible strings are magnetic fields they penetrate the suns atmosphere guiding the flow of heat and orchestrating mighty explosions sdo will be able to produce detailed maps of magnetism on the sun revealing the strings for all to see
6157786 right now sdo is in a thermal vacuum chamber getting tested for the rough ride to space
6157787 no spacecraft has ever been as close to the sun as solar probe plus will go only 7 million km from the surface thats unexplored territory and we expect to learn a great deal about the suns atmosphere by going there
6157788 imagine trying to figure out earths climate by watching only one side of the planet impossible yet thats what weve been doing with the sun
6157789 weve just finished the science and technology definition team report which lays out the whole strategy for solar sentinels
6157790 theres no point in studying the sun if you dont understand what it does to earth
6157791 right now we have our hands full with the others
6157792 yesterday i was informed that yet another inquiry has been initiated against my complaints of incidents of sexual harassment in the r amp aw but what purpose will another inquiry serve instead of the people against whom i have made complaints i am the one who is being harassed trailed and put under surveillance so i decided to go to the prime ministers office since i was not allowed inside and since i have been waiting to see the prime minister for weeks i decided enough was enough
6157793 i would rather die than live life like a living dead i would do it right in front of you sir
6157794 we have found her allegations unfounded and baseless she was angling for a foreign posting which was not given to her which is probably behind all this
6157795 inquiries on sexual harassment lead nowhere as it becomes a who said what battle at the end of which the male dominated system successfully fixes the victim
6157796 several inquiries with no legal status have been constituted within the department by shri ashok chaturvedi not to investigate my complaint but to invite me to prove my case i have failed to understand how i could possibly prove things that happened in one on one meetings
6157797 it became apparent that invitations for money and official favours were more a rule than exception it also became apparent that special funds and facilities were being used for this purpose
6157798 una persona mi ha detto che non mi aveva mai visto piangere che io ero una persona forte che non si fermava ad una storia cos che guardava sempre dritto a se be io ho guardato dritto di fronte a me ho trovato quella pistola non mi sono arresa dovevo sempre guardare avanti e lho fatto non mi sono fermata ad una storia ho solamente deciso di non iniziarne mai pi amore su questa panchina ci siamo dati il nostro primo bacio te lo ricordi sotto le stelle abbracciati ecco io volevo lasciarti un ricordo proprio su questa panchina ti amo
6157799 gott wollte ihnen zeigen wie reich und herrlich dieses geheimnis unter den v lkern ist christus ist unter euch er ist die hoffnung auf herrlichkeit ihn verk ndigen wir wir ermahnen jeden menschen und belehren jeden mit aller weisheit um dadurch alle in der gemeinschaft mit christus vollkommen zu machen
6157800 ich will dich vor dem volk und den heiden retten zu denen ich dich sende um ihnen die augen zu ffnen denn sie sollen sich von der finsternis zum licht und von der macht des satans zu gott bekehren und sollen durch den glauben an mich die vergebung der s nden empfangen und mit den geheiligten am erbe teilhaben
6157801 allen aber die ihn aufnahmen gab er macht kinder gottes zu werden allen die an seinen namen glauben
6157802 denn die liebe christi dr ngt uns da wir erkannt haben einer ist f r alle gestorben also sind alle gestorben er ist aber f r alle gestorben damit die lebenden nicht mehr f r sich leben sondern f r den der f r sie starb und auferweckt wurde also sch tzen wir von jetzt an niemand mehr nur nach menschlichen ma st ben ein auch wenn wir fr her christus nach menschlichen ma st ben eingesch tzt haben jetzt sch tzen wir ihn nicht mehr so ein wenn also jemand in christus ist dann ist er eine neue sch pfung das alte ist vergangen neues ist geworden
6157803 wenn ihr in mir bleibt und wenn meine worte in euch bleiben dann bittet um alles was ihr wollt ihr werdet es erhalten
6157804 diese waren freundlicher als die in thessalonich mit gro er bereitschaft nahmen sie das wort auf und forschten tag f r tag in den schriften nach ob sich dies wirklich so verhielte
6157805 da sagte jesus zu ihnen kommt her folgt mir nach
6157806 mein vater wird dadurch verherrlicht da ihr reiche frucht bringt und meine j nger werdet
6157807 wer meine gebote hat und sie h lt der ist es der mich liebt wer mich aber liebt wird von meinem vater geliebt werden und auch ich werde ihn lieben und mich ihm offenbaren
6157808 werft alle eure sorge auf ihn denn er k mmert sich um euch
6157809 darum sage ich lasst euch vom geist leiten dann werdet ihr das begehren des fleisches nicht erf llen denn das begehren des fleisches richtet sich gegen den geist das begehren des geistes aber gegen das fleisch beide stehen sich als feinde gegen ber so da ihr nicht imstande seid das zu tun was ihr wollt
6157810 aber ihr werdet die kraft des heiligen geistes empfangen der auf euch herabkommen wird und ihr werdet meine zeugen sein in jerusalem und in ganz jud a und samarien und bis an die grenzen der erde
6157811 la t uns aufeinander achten und uns zur liebe und zu guten taten anspornen lasst uns nicht unseren zusammenk nften fernbleiben wie es einigen zur gewohnheit geworden ist sondern ermuntert einander und das um so mehr als ihr seht da der tag naht
6157812 you spoke so beautifully you have to make this a reality otherwise it will remain a speech
6157813 i get to shift economies its extremely liberating i breathe differently
6157814 its never a full implementation it is easier to dream than to do
6157815 in america and australia it has to be outside the car
6157816 she pulls in then shes squeezing between two cars to drag out this big cable and walk it back to her car shell be wearing her nice work clothes and getting them dirty
6157817 weve just lost half the market you need to make life simple for people
6157818 but at the end what you want is a snowflake
6157819 what do we need to make this happen two servos two degrees of movement for the arm
6157820 this is the driver experience he goes into a spot and the spot connects itself in 2008 we put the cable in the unit in 2010 we use an arm in 2012 theres a smart arm that connects automatically for the home unit the users get a pull cable for free or they pay 500 and they get autoconnect itll cost 250 to build and well sell it for 500
6157821 by the time hes thought of something to him its been completed its been achieved
6157822 the other trait is that by the time youve understood what hes thinking hes already somewhere else youre in catch up mode 24 7
6157823 in order to bring about this dramatic change sometimes we need a boy like in the fairy tales to say look the emperor has no clothes we can all see that for ourselves so how come we havent said so and this boy comes along and puts things in motion to bring about change and the boy in this story and he really is a boy practically but he has achieved more than many adults have is of course shai agassi
6157824 when you want a fish you get a woman and when you want a woman you get a fish
6157825 he had the self image of being an equal to steve jobs or michael dell or bill gates
6157826 even if this ends up destroying for lack of a better word my refinery business that will be small money compared to what this will be when you play chess you give up something to get something else
6157827 we wouldnt have invested if we thought this was a onetime one place story
6157828 you dont have the normal car problem where you need first gear to get off the line we just took the original transmission and stuck it permanently in second
6157829 when you take your foot off the pedal the car has kinetic energy
6157830 the motor starts charging the battery turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy
6157831 if youre regening it means you used too much energy in the first place
6157832 ah you are not a computer its not like you can calculate how much energy you need to get to that red light
6157833 every time you do regen theres a not like you get it all back
6157834 the perfect driver would cruise around without ever using regen or the brakes when they came to their destination they would coast to a stop
6157835 zero percent tax on our cars dong as a partner
6157836 but there was already 0 percent tax on alternative energy cars in denmark
6157837 ill be offering 20 000 cars in a market where youre selling 60 000 cars how many have you planned to sell in 2011 in denmark because i recommend you take them off your plan
6157838 i have a strong feeling this is where the industry is going to go
6157839 we are not aware of any reason why automakers would not sign up for this
6157840 i have so many sins to pay on my climate bill right now that we hope this works really fast
6157841 we separated the ownership of the car and the ownership of the battery see car companies dont know how to assess the life of the battery so they go through these complicated programs of testing them for a long period of time and we told the car company you know what just like you dont sell a car with a card that says here is oil for the life of the car you dont sell cars with the batteries for the life of the car because the battery is crude oil
6157842 if we also buy clean generation we reduce the price of clean electrons so that at the end of 10 years clean electrons are cheaper than coal based electrons and nobody builds another coal plant at that point thats another 40 percent of co 2 emissions thats the treaty tony blair is now working to get for the world by 2050 im telling you we can get there a decade after we finish the car side we can get there in 2030 60 percent reduction in our co 2 emissions
6157843 i joke that 29 days a month shais my boss and one day a month
6157844 will transfer 2 trillion to 3 trillion out of the economy
6157845 we dont make batteries so arent we going to swap out foreign oil dependence for foreign battery reliance
6157846 all you need is a plug right why would you need an infrastructure
6157847 my proposal was about health care or something in san francisco
6157848 this is the irony the city is working harder to get their business than the business itself shouldnt he be sucking up to san francisco
6157849 our mission is to break the worlds oil addiction before it breaks us
6157850 were not its not us to them its them to us you see people want this to happen we just happen to be in the way of their getting what they want we cant give them the car fast enough thats something we need to capture were here to serve you not were here to sell to you were a facilitator not the creator this is going to be a community we just need to get out of their way theyre going to push for policy theyre going to sell the cars theyre going to be zealots
6157851 he tells you the story and it sounds so simple why dont we have it today why isnt it here already

6157853 so spricht der herr dein sch pfer der dich im mutterleib geformt hat der dir hilft f rchte dich nicht jakob mein knecht du jeschurun den ich erw hlte
6157854 denn gott hat die welt so sehr geliebt dass er seinen einzigen sohn hingab damit jeder der an ihn glaubt nicht zugrunde geht sondern das ewige leben hat
6157855 vater die stunde ist da verherrliche deinen sohn damit der sohn dich verherrlicht denn du hast ihm macht ber alle menschen gegeben damit er allen die du ihm gegeben hast ewiges leben schenkt das ist das ewige leben dich den einzigen wahren gott zu erkennen und jesus christus den du gesandt hast

6157858 were optimistic that the benefit of creating a foundation of 1 billion or more and the benefits that that can provide the underserved population in other words the good that that can do will be easily understood
6157859 the emphasis will go from patients and employers right to the shareholders
6157860 our job is to protect uk dental patients by making sure all dental professionals practising in the uk are trained appropriately and registered with us
6157861 thats why we want to encourage people considering travelling abroad for dental care to ask questions before making a decision about their treatment qualifications and standards are likely to differ from country to country so its important that you collect as much information as you can before committing to anything
6157862 the national dental survey 2008 found that 16 of people would be willing to travel abroad for dental treatment and the figure was even higher among the 18 to 30 age group suggesting the trend will continue
6157863 this document provides members of the public with a very useful starting point on the questions to ask before getting dental treatment abroad
6157864 styles and standards of dentistry can vary a great deal from one country to another and if things do go wrong patients could still be left facing some difficult and potentially expensive decisions
6157865 however by researching their chosen practitioner and asking the right questions they can reduce the chances of encountering potentially avoidable problems further down the line
6157866 for some reason cancer cells become addicted to certain genes when we blocked the gene that results in the enzyme pi3k c2alpha using a fairly new tool used extensively by our lab called rna interference we found this had an abrupt adverse effect on a variety of cancer cells
6157867 although we must further determine what happens in normal cells to confirm the therapeutic value we also found that decreasing levels of pi3k class 2 alpha to a certain point didnt kill the cancer cells but did sensitize them to chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol
6157868 this alone could contribute to a more effective anti cancer strategy in a subset of cancers

6157878 theyre basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill the illinois version of baipa
6157879 let me clarify this right now because they have not been telling the truth and i hate to say that people are lying but heres a situation where folks are lying
6157880 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe vs wade so for people to suggest that i was somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics that we have to get beyond
6157881 misrepresented my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong and thats whats been happening

6157914 our proposed research will address some of the deepest questions in computer science
6157915 most people dont realize that ecommerce rests upon cryptosystems which in turn rest upon problems that we assume are intractable and cannot be decrypted
6157916 but is this true every time you do an ecommerce transaction how do you know that that hasnt been exposed to everybody else in the world understanding intractability will help better guide computer security efforts
6157917 in quantum computing and in other areas our model of nature seems to suggest that nature is solving intractable problems
6157918 we dont know whether or not this is a problem with our model or whether nature is doing something which we do not understand
6157919 there is a big open question as to whether the problems that we believe are intractable actually are if we discover that actually all these problems that we think are hard are not hard that would be an earth shattering discovery its hard to think of any other scientific breakthrough that would have more impact today

6157934 the 100x100 project strives to create technology that will make it viable for all 100 million homes in the u s to have at least 100 megabits per second of connectivity we believe this will provide the needed catalyst for the next generation of technological innovation that will stimulate economic growth for the country and re establish the united states as a leader in the internet age
6157935 to accomplish this we have partnered with internet2 to deploy our own breakable nationwide network testbed that will play a critical role in testing and validating many of the architectural ideas we have begun to conceptualize since the start of the project
6157936 network research needs a proving ground for new methods and designs internet2s dedicated network facilities were built with testbed applications in mind meaning we are uniquely able to support this kind of leading edge research we are excited about our participation in the 100x100 project and the innovations that it will foster
6157937 to put it into perspective there are more microbes than there are cells in the human body in fact they often are the first line of defense against disease or environmental disasters
6157938 microbes are mostly our friends but sometimes they can be pretty nasty
6157939 this approach will advance human progress in environmental protection public health and safety sustainable energy and many other research areas
6157940 the computational tools will pave the way to less expensive and more reliable tests that can be used across the globe the sheer number of microbial communities presents great commercial potential
6157941 itanium based systems with their relatively large caches provide the effective memory bandwidth we need for fast processing of genomic information their high availability design has been serving us very well providing very dependable access for years
6157942 the efficiency and availability of the itanium systems have enabled us to make very rapid progress and broaden our research into a broad range of genomes

6157983 for companies with rapidly growing storage needs and it costs it is critical to keep the price per gigabyte down without compromising performance
6157984 ibrix fusion filemigrator continuously and automatically moves information to strike a balance between the cost of storage hardware and the value of the data it stores this feature enables the most effective use of storage and eliminates the need for system administrators to worry about managing data migration manually
6157985 large companies are putting together server farms of tens of thousands of computers even approaching 100 thousand and the big challenge is to interconnect all these computers so that they can talk to each other as quickly as possible without incurring significant costs
6157986 we are proposing a new topology for ethernet data center connectivity
6157987 our work addresses the problem of data center network connectivity in a world where consolidation is increasingly taking place in data centers
6157988 the history of computing and technology has an innumerable set of examples where commodity parts take over the functionality of more specialized pieces of equipment
6157989 but that commoditization hasnt taken place on the communications side so we do have these specialized components still living in the network infrastructure that incur significant costs and complexity
6157990 the other issue is that people are treating the data center as a mini internet
6157991 thats fine but they are then forced to use the same components they might use in the wide area network with a bunch of concerns that dont come up in the data center environment adversarial environments attacks parties that might not trust each other etc so you have a lot of functionalities in these specialized switching components that you really dont need in your data center and you wind up paying for it in dollars and in complexity
6157992 independent of whether our technique is successful or someone elses is five years from now switching and communication infrastructure in the datacenter will be based on these small commodity building blocks
6157993 one of the big benefits of our approach is that it scales trivially to 10 gige at the edge whereas competing techniques rely on aggregation to ever faster links to achieve higher speeds
6157994 if you were to go to 10 gige at the edge for servers today you would need to aggregate to 40 gige or 100 gigelinks moving up the tree topology unfortunately the 40gbps ethernet standard isnt even out yet and when it does become available it will be very expensive because were using identical network elements in our topology today 48 port 10 gige ethernet switches are becoming relatively inexpensive so we would scale trivially to that environment as well
6157995 from a cost perspective to build out a 25 000 node cluster today using current techniques with 100 percent bandwidth just the switching equipment would cost somewhere in the order of 28 million whereas with our technique using the identical network elements would deliver the same performance but incur costs of maybe 4 million thats a factor of seven difference

6158030 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6158031 we decided to do a cover on this disc and we didnt want to do what every other band is doing these days and take a pop or rock song from the 80s
6158032 we figured a song by a band with real metal cred would do best for us this song never got the attention it deserved its an amazingly well written song and even though its not the most complex song nevermore has done it is in my opinion one of their best we ran the idea by nevermore and they gave us their blessing so we were very happy to have the original artists behind it i couldnt be happier with the way it came out
6158033 to our fans it is with huge regret and disappointment that we have been forced to cancel our imminent european festival appearances at leeds reading 2 days a week area 4 as well as exclusive performances for mtv europe and virgin tv the other night joey jordison broke his ankle and doctors have advised joey to stay off his leg for 4 6 weeks to prevent further injury or permanent and more serious damage we know you will be hugely disappointed and so are we canceling shows is never an easy decision and we apologize to all our fans friends and family for not being there to throw down with you we will be back in europe this november and cant wait to see you all then
6158034 aaron didnt do anything wrong he did what i did he used the guard to go to ou
6158035 christian strong duty values heart country proud blah blah blah
6158036 and there are too many air national guardsmen that have served for him to do that he is not one of them
6158037 right after sept 11 things settled down and deployments were starting to come down
6158038 we had received a requirement to send a team to kuwait and all of a sudden aaron submits a conscientious objector packet i believe it was a subterfuge to keep from going to the desert cause he was on the list
6158039 i also did everything i was asked to do and went everywhere i was asked to go i sought the co status mainly because of my christian principles
6158040 and i had serious questions about whether or not i could take someones life
6158041 youre not deployed while the request is being acted on
6158042 so until its either approved or disapproved the co application he was saying he cant pick up a weapon to defend this country he sat in an administrative role at will rogers while other people filled in for him and went to the desert
6158043 honestly it never really entered my mind when i signed up for the service that i might have to take another persons life thats why it was such a tough decision i did it to protect the guys i was with
6158044 i did a brief investigation found out what he was doing and submitted the information to the judge advocate general jag
6158045 when youre in a certain status you have to pay for your meals
6158046 but he was going over and eating and not paying for his meals which constitutes fraud
6158047 it was over one meal and he placed me in cuffs and said he was charging me with fraud people were shocked they were completely surprised
6158048 he was involuntarily mobilized and deployed stateside under operation noble eagle which was only stateside i was deployed with him at this time while deployed he did everything he could think of to get home after he found that there was a chance we could be forward deployed overseas
6158049 he was required to pay for meals he ate at the base dining facility
6158050 he was investigated and it was found that even after being told this he still ate there without paying for those meals

6158055 does it seem to you as if the socially responsible investing scheme put the interests of the state workers and teachers ahead of those entrusted to invest the money
6158056 to be fair the funds have performed well in recent years despite their self imposed limits on what they can invest in theyve generally outperformed the benchmarks in past years but to be fair they could have done much better had they not been slowed by the socially responsible yoke
6158057 over the past five years californias population has grown by 7 percent and inflation has been 17 percent but general fund spending has increased by about 26 billion or 33 percent during that same period

6158061 highwaymen were a real danger in the late 19th century and this cunning design might just have saved your honour property and even life a dainty weapon was concealed in a secret compartment of this seemingly normal ladies purse the barrel could hold only one bullet so you had to make your shot count
6158062 the way that is going to prevent that is to take the children out of the home
6158063 wouldnt you like them to be there for each other if you couldnt be
6158064 she never got anything other than we want the children
6158065 she is going to do everything she can to see this thing through and be reunited with her daughter again
6158066 the cultures of two ends of that pipeline are very different
6158067 with this commitment we feel were in position to recognize the findings and merge them into our efforts
6158068 the timing seemed right because were in these times where people dont necessarily know if their jobs going to be there tomorrow and when a lot of people dont necessarily like their jobs they have now
6158069 why dont you go out there and revisit those kinds of jobs that actually made america great those great working class blue collar jobs thats what these are it was great to get these contestants out of that cubicle that conceptual life were in and get out there and get some real raw experience in a place with high stakes and high rewards
6158070 in the old days it was the action heroes movie stars who were our heroes then for a really weird little while politicians and bankers and people that made a lot of money were our heroes
6158071 since they took all of our money with them and left us broke were standing around going who are our heroes today i think whats happened is were starting to look within ourselves were trying to remind ourselves what made america great it was the fact that we did stuff with our hands we created stuff we worked we didnt just basically think it and outsource it i think thats changing
6158072 when chinese people speak chinese they dont sound like chinese people they sound like people
6158073 insert suppository round end first into the back passage wash hands
6158074 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6158075 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
6158076 a security object is so important at this age because it helps kids feel safe
6158077 it soothes them at bedtime and helps them keep up their routine when away from home
6158078 i know how much you loved teddy you must be very sad
6158079 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill up front
6158080 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect up front than to go after someone on the back end
6158081 its reasonable to go to an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
6158082 but hes always been a good player you have to get opportunities in the league and sometimes when you dont you get stereotyped i think thats what happened to j t
6158083 this isnt a guy out of control by any means j t just plays with a lot of competitive fire
6158084 she said the women in her day didnt think about breastfeeding
6158085 two or three generations ago they didnt even have the information in front of them to the benefits of breastfeeding
6158086 now they do and it seems more of a simple choice for them to say oh yes i am going to breastfeed
6158087 its status in many communities to bottle feed your baby
6158088 but we have to turn around and tell them what would you do in your home country
6158089 its something i truly believe and not having the support makes it challenging
6158090 when i speak to my family theyll ask me oh are you still breastfeeding her
6158091 they felt it was weird especially if its a boy
6158092 but its a natural kind of thing the baby is not going to look at you as a sexual object whether its a boy or a girl
6158093 within a decade you saw women going to the hospital having their babies a lot of medical personnel involved and science involved
6158094 consequently infant feeding practices went more in the realm of the doctor and not the woman and her community and her mother
6158095 there was a point where i wanted to give up but i knew i had decided i wanted to do it so i decided to start back
6158096 and we do have a bond shes a mommas girl
6158097 now we have strong female characters capable of standing on their own
6158098 people who are published will tell you its because of who they met here
6158099 its a close knit supportive chapter theyre my family and coming to the conference is a great way to get your work in front of acquiring publishers
6158100 agents and editors want to know who is your heroine
6158101 if you have to repeat your pitch five or six times to different people its going to get honed
6158102 the amount of promotion you can expect from a good house if youre lucky is four to six weeks after launch
6158103 youre going to be disappointed unless you are proactive and take your future into your own hands
6158104 when my editor told me you write like jane austen my daughters knew what it meant to me
6158105 i was tired of getting rejections because i didnt know my craft
6158106 the romance writers of america gave me what i consider the equivalent of a degree in fiction writing
6158107 i have been in love with christ since i was 4
6158108 theres no tlp token lost person who is evangelized and saved in the last act my characters are christians before the books start they stumble like we all do
6158109 a sex scene must be emotionally true to character and it has to make the conflict worse
6158110 do you practice your love scenes before you write them
6158111 she told the times her cabin costs about 7 000 a month which compares favorably to the cost of a retirement home in florida
6158112 i looked up and saw i had time to get off a shot
6158113 when i caught it it was about three seconds i thought i could make it to the basket a big man came up and i thought i could go by him and get to the basket but he kept backing up and i rose up for the 3
6158114 usually a jump shot is better than a runner thats the way you practice it
6158115 especially when the game is close theyve been playing as hard as they can and then theyre down 12 it really puts them at a disadvantage and hurts their confidence it really was a turning point
6158116 we all knew what was going on we didnt need to talk about it much at halftime
6158117 we were taking bad shots and it just wasnt working for us we got to playing for ourselves instead of the team
6158118 exactly exactly and that doesnt really work too much unless somebodys hot
6158119 you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6158120 theres a sense of pride that comes with beating a champion
6158121 its go time and were all ready to go the moneys on the table
6158122 you need to be mindful all the time when working your tileset
6158123 hopefully something else can come in or the union will give up its rights
6158124 that was 700 jobs now they are not coming here
6158125 the governor and i worked hard to make this happen
6158126 delta is considering making platinum medallion upgrade certificates more flexible by making some less expensive fare classes available for upgrades and increasing upgrade availability
6158127 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6158128 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6158129 weve gotten reports of water inside homes but i couldnt tell you how many and i dont know how extensive that is
6158130 but i can tell you that from what ive seen some people wont be able to get out of their houses until the water recedes
6158131 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
6158132 my husband is from kansas and he gets all bug eyed when he hears tornadoes
6158133 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
6158134 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
6158135 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
6158136 i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6158137 i am glad to know he is from jamaica and that he is supernatural
6158138 it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100 meters and then his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6158139 the conventional wisdom is that this election is going to be a referendum on barack obama
6158140 his people are smart enough to realize this doesnt necessarily work to their benefit
6158141 kerry did an effective job of showing that bush didnt deserve to be president
6158142 but none of the above isnt on the ballot and in the end kerry did not give voters enough of a reason to choose him
6158143 its revealing that barack obama attempts to run a campaign under the thin veil of a positive message when he has consistently shown that hes running a negative campaign
6158144 what sen obama is doing is laying out a very clear choice
6158145 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
6158146 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
6158147 a central strategic imperative for the obama campaign is to make sure that when people go into the voting booth in november they are thinking about john mccain and george bush
6158148 kill kidnap and cause bodily harm upon a major candidate for president of the united states that is senator barack obama
6158149 a person discovered to have ammunition a handgun and other weapons
6158150 that he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
6158151 if he wanted to kill senator obama he would simply shoot him with a sniper rifle
6158152 this storm is going to be with us for a while

6158157 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
6158158 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day
6158159 ive been saying all season that 200 means more to me than 100 meters
6158160 it means a lot because ive been dreaming about it since i was yea high
6158161 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6158162 we are deeply saddened that leroi moore saxophonist and founding member of dave matthews band died unexpectedly tuesday afternoon august 19 2008 at hollywood presbyterian medical center in los angeles from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia leroi had recently returned to his los angeles home to begin an intensive physical rehabilitation program
6158163 years ago we had theses shelves in our living room
6158164 they where filled with trophies and plaques my older daughter beyonc had won in different talent shows i came home from work one day and every last one of those trophies was broken and scattered across the room
6158165 solange broke them every single one and didnt deny it

6158167 a girl of 12 brought up by her parents on a strict vegan diet has been admitted to hospital with a degenerative bone condition said to have left her with the spine of an 80 year old
6158168 the youngster fed on a strict meat and dairy free diet from birth is being treated at the citys royal hospital for sick children she is said to have a severe form of rickets and to have suffered a number of fractured bones the condition is caused by a lack of vitamin d which is needed to absorb calcium and is found in liver oily fish and dairy produce
6158169 dont expect that the same approaches that worked well with a boomer workforce will work equally well with xers
6158170 this is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all
6158171 her condition is believed to be serious and rumors are flying that she had died
6158172 theres a real dilemma facing operators of coal powered plants
6158173 the price of coal has exploded recently and it continues to rise rapidly long term coal contracts are coming in at 4 times the price of the last iteration of the contract
6158174 30 a ton is 03 a kilowatt hour for electricity generated from coal
6158175 for some of the older coal power plants you are looking at a 30 40 or 50 increase in the electricity price all at once and an ongoing uncertain future
6158176 s ometimes the louder you are the less people hear you its kind of like when people mute the tv as soon as the obnoxiously loud commercials come on similarly most people tune out angry rhetoric and extreme tactics they might provide a momentary distraction or a media spectacle but the extra attention is quickly lost
6158177 frankly animal advocates also need to soften their tone and limit their expectations
6158178 i get the feeling that advocates who buy into this reasoning mean well but have allowed themselves to be fooled
6158179 i agree with the quote that we do need moderates we need people who can help gently persuade consumers to eat less meat and be nicer to animals however we need extremists too abolitionists are the core of our movement not the superfluous
6158180 since ive taken pencils from work home i may as well commit grand larceny
6158181 i may have gone vegan or at least started my path to veganism much earlier
6158182 you know i would have stopped raping women ten years earlier if people hadnt been so rude when they told me rape was wrong
6158183 finally he looks at me and i notice his eyes are teary youre right he says i of course always like to be told that i am right but in this instance
6158184 i am touched and humbled this man whom i had judged to be without human feeling is weeping in front of me a stranger this man whom i had seen as callous and even heartless is actually someone who cares and deeply how wrong how profoundly and terribly wrong i had been
6158185 when i first met him i would not have thought it possible that i would ever say the things i am saying here
6158186 i consider myself privileged to have spent that day with him and grateful that i was allowed to be a catalyst for the unfolding of his spirit i know my presence served him in some way but i also know and know full well that
6158187 one can be polite considerate and respectful and listen empathically yet be firm principled and effective
6158188 you know since those black people were so nice and rational now im going to stop hate mongering
6158189 on the one hand you seem to be saying that as activists we should act a certain general way implying that its better at least in many cases to cast politeness aside and go with a more
6158190 i have noticed very consistently that when i or others talk to someone in a very accusatory and or angry tone about their meat eating they tend to retaliate with defensive or retaliatory remarks dig in their heels and or become more resistant to our message
6158191 this guy yelled in my face and that was the turning point
6158192 animal advocates also need to soften their tone and limit their expectations
6158193 i believe theres too much emphasis on the consumer in the animal rights movement all too often were asking consumers to change their behavior and were not getting at the root causes of the problem the producers
6158194 we ought to encourage more vegan entrepreneurs to merge their vegan passion activism and lifestyle with their work
6158195 with every release fedora has expanded technological borders and brought cutting edge technologies into the hands of the general public
6158196 while ubuntu is an excellent distribution there is something to be said for fedoras fostering a community of contributors rather than consumers
6158197 i was inspired and felt compelled that i could help them
6158198 in the most detailed study of its kind a new report shows 89 percent of these women remain disease free 10 years after diagnosis and 81 percent are cancer free after 15 years
6158199 we have to move away from the traditional gun control debate which is going nowhere
6158200 we have to shift to talking about the perpetrators and developing the intervention model
6158201 the same faith you put in the police department you have to put in us youve got good cops and youve got bad cops it can go either way
6158202 is a refrain brown said he hears from young men
6158203 and success for young hispanics and african americans in chicago is staying alive they have a successful day if they stay alive
6158204 l o v e thats what theyre looking for people who are going to be real to them not be judgmental
6158205 this man is a jewel we need more of him
6158206 i need more of beto i need a beto on the north side

6158211 and i think a path like what chairman greenspan suggested is probably the best path
6158212 how neurotic would investors need to be to buy into something like that
6158213 the government wipes you out completely and then asks for more of your money later on in a smaller company what so they can wipe you out again next time around
6158214 these entities have been absolutely essential to the long term 50 year growth of home ownership in the u s
6158215 the debt markets are where the gses live and on that front its not as bad as the financial press is making things seem
6158216 the offering was oversubscribed for one thing and the cost of any new capital for anyone in this market is elevated whether via debt or equity
6158217 jp morgan saw similar elevation on a recent debt issue as well and nobody began talking about the companys future
6158218 the debt was priced as if freddie were a private company operating in a tough credit environment
6158219 continues to have strong access to the debt markets at attractive spreads
6158220 treasury is monitoring market developments vigilantly we are focused on encouraging market stability mortgage availability and protecting the taxpayers interests

6158225 e m has a certain je ne sais quoi that evokes an admiration for her brilliance wonder at her beauty and laughter for her way of breaking it to you
6158226 i believe if e m were a superheroine her main power would be sarcasm
6158227 if pope benedict is conservative catholicisms posterchild e m is the pin up centerfold
6158228 considering all of the other right wing nutters out there the american princess is only mildly ridiculous
6158229 a well written very conservative blog with an author who offers no apologies for her beliefs
6158230 like the catholic eva longoria assuming eva longoria isnt catholic
6158231 e m proves that you can survive living in ann arbor
6158232 odi et amo but not in the way catullus meant it
6158233 that woman on americas most wanted only bore an amazing resemblence to e m some say it wasnt actually her
6158234 e m you are your own subculture i would like to be part of that subculture but i dont think its acceptable for me to wear that much pink

6158239 all of us who work here are passionate about politics and specific political issues but if we all start to decorate the exterior of our windows

6158243 i see the way the propaganda and information war is waged against americas sons and daughters and how patients are treated who claim to be injured from a vaccine
6158244 im surprised he still wants to stay in the marines
6158245 are they experimenting on soldiers im convinced they are but probably only in small lots and probably not mixed in with the general vaccinations theres a lot of similar stories about marines and soldiers getting single shots in desert storm and lots of indications it may be a partial cause of gulf war syndrome
6158246 empirical surveys on the international egrc market are rare so this report is welcome and timely the market knows the quality of gartners work across different technology sectors and the magic quadrant has become a de facto guide as to where individual vendors stand naturally therefore we are delighted that we have come out as the only european headquartered challenger to the current international status quo we are confident with the recent rapid growth of sword achievers representation across the globe that our position will improve further by the time the next review of the market is conducted

6158274 last month we estimated her net worth at 375 million dollars when the stunning heiress is not poring over financial reports or gracing the pages of thai magazines shes planning her upcoming fashion line

6158276 the manufacture distribution and use of it equipment is responsible for around 2 of total global carbon emissions thats on a par with the airline industry
6158277 as an it company cobweb believes it has a responsibility to lead the way by reducing our own environmental impact and by working with our customers we can achieve even more that is what our new green community is about collective action that makes a difference
6158278 with over one third of it departments likely to have one or more environmental criteria in their top six buying criteria in 2010 it makes good business sense too
6158279 as a hosted it services provider cobweb works hard to keep our environmental impact to a minimum we also help our customers to reduce their own environmental footprint by reducing the need to maintain energy hungry servers on their premises
6158280 we were extremely pleased to receive our iso 14001 accreditation but we do not intend to rest on our laurels we will continue to look at reducing our own carbon footprint and encouraging our customers to join us in a variety of green community initiatives

6158282 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6158283 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6158284 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6158285 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6158286 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6158287 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations
6158288 there is a great wealth of uk automotive engineering ingenuity and innovation that can lead the world in the newly emerging zero emission vehicle space

6158301 cusack grew up in a massive house on sheridan road
6158302 its slightly disingenuous to say he had to scrape together 2 50 im thinking that wasnt an issue
6158303 weve seen ehealthforum triple its traffic in a year 15 percent in the last two months actually more noticeably a dramatic increase of visitors to our ask a doctor section on average over 100 people are seeking our doctors advice per day it has become apparent that more and more people are checking out medical advice online before visiting their regular doctor or they want a second opinion
6158304 more and more people find the unconditional support from others in our forums play a significant role in the healing process indeed many of our visitors go on to become volunteers posting responses help and support on other peoples posts caring and sharing is a great healer in itself many of our visitors discover that others have had similar experiences which they find enormously helpful a problem shared is a problem halved and thats half the battle
6158305 as technology develops i think we might see more and more people turn to online consultations and i hope to be on the edge of that movement
6158306 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6158307 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6158308 so it means a lot more to me actually than the 100 means
6158309 hes just blessed with an uncanny frame an uncanny quickness a huge competitive heart and he is having a good time which i think our sport sorely needs to see
6158310 he got an incredible start guys of 6 5 should not be able to start like that its that long massive stride hes eating up so much more track than others he came in focused knowing he would likely win the gold and hes got the record
6158311 youre back there giving it everything youve got its brutal
6158312 hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6158313 as he gets older physically more mature he can only get faster

6158315 you can be sure that if i was going to be able to do that id be doing that with congressman wamp and wed be having a special press conference to announce it
6158316 thats a very serious problem i dont have a solution to it yet were continuing to work hard on it my staff has been meeting with the retired oak ridgers and we stay in close touch with zach the rumors are i hope that im working on it i dont have a solution to it
6158317 ill add that this is a transformative time chairman bart gordon and i had a conversation this morning with a labor leader about that very thing because making everyone aware of this is very important im not sure we can expect much cooperation in the next four months from this administration i think you know what im talking about the congressman previously said he didnt think thered be any movement by energy secretary samuel bodman so weve got to prepare as quick as we can to get to the right people based on the outcome of this falls election and there are a lot of other issues from the museum to ifdp integrated facilities disposition program that were trying to get resolved but right now with this administration its not easy and so as a result weve got to prepare for the new paradigm come january and hit the ground running thats what leadership is all about
6158318 closed on mondays which is onis production arm have been shopping julius pretty much since it was published and the first i knew about this sort of deal was actually at the san diego comic con this year
6158319 i couldnt really talk about it had to kind of keep it under my hat so im pleased that its finally been made public
6158320 im not contracted to write the screenplay or anything like that contrary to what some of the blogs have been reporting which i find hilarious
6158321 the amount that some people read into the briefest press releases i find highly amusing but hopefully ive been told that theyll be eager for my input
6158322 the negotiator was one of my favorites from the 90s
6158323 it was very intelligent very well directed because there was a lot of twists and turns and it couldve quite easily been handled very badly and it wasnt it was done very very well f gary gray is an interesting choice hes done some good films hes done some interesting films id always much rather have somebody whos interesting rather than safe
6158324 the strength of the graphic novel comes from the source material from shakespeares play julius is a modern reworking but its a fairly faithful adaptation of julius caesar and really i hope that they kind of just stick to that however if theres one little touch that im proud of in the graphic novel i hope that they keep in the movie thats brett whos the brutus in the graphic novel becomes more and more like julius he starts sounding like julius the only character in the graphic novel who speaks in shakespearean dialogue with lines often lifted straight from the play and as brett spirals downward he discovers that hes actually becoming more like julius than he wanted to he starts adopting the same patterns of speech which was kind of subtle but i was quite pleased with that and im glad a few people at the time a few reviewers picked up on it so that would be a nice touch
6158325 i am just one of the guys and it is a novelty but also a downside as i would like to have another woman colleague and friend with me
6158326 its a shame there are not more women in this line of work
6158327 while we were on a lake my father put me in a sailboat and just pushed it away and there i went

6158350 weve worked hard to make guidepoint for motorcycles different from anything on the market
6158351 other companies that sell gps tracking systems deliver their service through the web but guidepoint customers receive help from the guidepoint owned and operated response center whose employees are specifically trained to handle theft and roadside emergencies the systems features are unmatched its easy to install and we have an impressive recovery rate so it provides peace of mind for riders whose love of the open road may take them a little off the map

6158463 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question

6158465 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing

6158472 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6158473 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother

6158481 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6158482 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

6158505 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
6158506 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6158507 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6158508 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6158509 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

6158513 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6158514 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6158515 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6158516 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6158517 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

6158519 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6158520 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6158521 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

6158523 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6158524 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6158525 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
6158526 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
6158527 since 1992 including 12 drops for the 2004 athens games and 2000 sydney games

6158534 according to some shamanic traditions of the northern peoples the upper middle and lower worlds comprised nine realms of existence and these could be indicated on the tree of yggdrasil at the top of the vertical column was a heavenly realm sometimes called asgard where celestial beings existed below it was the place of enlightenment the realm of the mind the abode of thought and the fertile birthplace of ideas in the middle was the realm of material manifestation which was conditioned by time the home of the personality self and of ego consciousness with conditioning galore and little ease of escape to find the essence of other more inclusive realities below was a subterranean realm related to subconscious activity where shapes were formed from thought patterns n b creativity and hallucination are closely connected right thought or integrating the purpose of the creator with the created is part of the dynamic in the matter of using the primary forces with their north south east and west locations and wind fire water earth expressions we must remember our perceptual starting point may limit these forces ability to allow their conscious reality to meld with our intent nothing is more important than intent to a practitioner of what has been known as black arts to those who priests sought to keep ignorant of their own use thereof at the base of the column was a realm of inertia the place of potential it was sometimes referred to as hel a germanic word meaning covering because it covered the deepest areas of the unconscious it had none of the associations attributed to the fiery hell of the myths of later religions plagiarizers and ridiculing epithet hurlers on the horizontal plane were other aspects of being and of experience which similarly formed part of the hidden knowledge of the shamans the runic shamans of the ancient northern peoples acquired hidden trans occult knowledge by the use of angular symbols runes which could easily be carved on wood or chiselled into stone contrary to modern belief based on the conjecture of some anthropologists runes were not simply a secret code whose characters were used as substitutes for letters of the common alphabet it is likely that the majority of runic shamans could not read or write their own language or latin which became the language of the scholar after the roman influence runes actually represented patterns of manifestation and the laws responsible for shaping forms n b again into which energies could find expression they were and are symbols of a cosmic language and are valid on all levels of existence in the runic alphabet known as the elder futhark because it is considered the oldest of known runic systems divinatory systems have been around since man first thought the sticks of the i ching and the black and white painted sides of coconut shells used by orisha worshippers such as voudou and santeria are probably far older than any european hominid and certainly any white man and because the word f u th a r k is made up of its first six characters there are twenty four runes there are also just twenty four possible paths between the nine realms indicated on the tree of yggdrasil so the runes can serve also as travel permits enabling the runic shaman to explore inner space and as passports to these other realms of existence within the cosmic web shamans of britain and northern europe were thus aware that the cosmos functions at different levels of existence and that these broadly correspond to various aspects of the mind such a concept was fairly widespread among indigenous peoples and can be seen represented on certain tribal artefacts such as the totem poles of the red skinned indians of western north america actually not red skinned but the use of ochre as a spiritual protection among the beothuk of labrador led europeans to ridicule all indians in this manner the same can be said for how the kelts were portrayed as tattooed savages by caesar and the brown skinned maoris of new zealand who with british help in the 19th century wiped out the last kelts on the chatham islands or the specially carved crystal wands used by some american indian shamans the sceptres of european royalty and popery these artefacts often depicted three principal spirits on top of one another supported by an animal like figure at the bottom on a totem pole the top figure usually had wings to suggest an ability to travel far and wide these figures could be used to symbolize aspects of the human being of principal levels of awareness and of conscious subconscious superconscious and even unconscious aspects of the mind although these various states of the mind were not recognized by modern psychology until the end of the nineteenth century shamans had personified them as spirits or aspects for hundreds of years kahuna shamans of hawaii once part of a mighty prehistoric continent called mu which disappeared under the pacific ocean during an ecological disaster when the earth was pulled into a new and slightly longer orbit of the sun likened the subconscious to a hidden spirit within the human entity which although it was not able to talk experienced emotion and secretly and silently served the consciousness of the individual to whom it was attached
6158535 the inspirational and creative level of the mind which operated at a higher state of consciousness was recognized as the province of a higher spirit a high self which was immortal and which motivated the individual towards spiritual aspirations and noble deeds it was considered to guide and inspire the human self for it had divine like qualities among shamans of northern traditions however was an oral teaching the bardic tradition of the bairds by which my genes do instruct that recognized a fourth intelligence an instinctive and automative one which controlled and maintained the physical body and which was responsible for its protection and survival this intelligence operated at deep levels of unconscious activity partially perhaps the history book of our genes according to dr collins the head of the human genome project and was likened to an animal spirit because its action seemed largely instinctive since it normally disappeared when the human being suffered death it was not regarded in the same way as the other spirits each technique has been effective within its own culture but has derived from an earlier universal system of prehistory by recognizing the parallels and integrating the principles into a single harmonic system in the spirit of the travelling shamans i hope not only to get closer to the original system but also to provide modern people with a clear path to the cosmos of the shaman thus securing a firm foundation from which inner space may be explored and the benefits shared travelling shamans who went beyond the limitations of their own tribal customs recognized that no single group possessed all truth thus the kelts were into brotherhood rather than racial purity or ethnic ascendancy and so journeyed from tribe to tribe and place to place seeking knowledge gaining new insights weaving what they learned into what they already knew and imparting wisdom
6158536 the pre ragnarok viking gods this section was inspired by erik linklater and the legends of the orkney islands guided by thor and tested in meditation it contains no material of german origin written 1989 the sagas were written by shamans and other leaders to define the social spiritual and psychic objectives of the race where an image produced inspires man and is acceptable to spirit guides then those spirit guides will use the image as an interface and bring it to life thus creating an archetypal god the fossilised gods of monotheism on the other hand are just political mental or psychic control mechanisms stuck in time until dismantled spirit guides do not have a brain and need you to do their thinking and meditation for them if one serves the gods then they will serve you there are no free lunches note written february 2000 when man can generate enough energy and responsibility for his actions he will no longer need god or gods until such time he needs a first rate energy source the viking gods provide a first class source of energy suitable for propelling man through enlightenment as in zen they will help conquer the zodiac and the akashic elements fire air water and earth and other frost giants of emotion
6158537 super dense cosmic frictionless medium that carries light and all the universal forces of nature
6158538 1 this latter observation may explain the similar view held by such different areas of thought as those of edgar cayce and quantum physics namely that our thoughts do indeed create our reality and that it is our perceptions that drive what is real for each of us as thought becomes impressed upon this sea of information
6158539 that magic may be wrought on a man just as easily as through his name as through his hair his nails or any other material part of his person
6158540 yes we have before us the records of the entity now known or called
6158541 the record of god of thee thy soul within and the knowledge of same
6158542 the akashic records or the book of life can be equated to the universes super computer system
6158543 all recent computer simulations of the early universe have one prediction in common the first large scale structures to form in the young universe are long filaments connected at their ends in nodes the models typically look like a three dimensional spiders web and resemble the neural structure of a brain
6158544 the seven major chakras are formed at points where standing lines of light or meridians cross each other 21 times the 21 minor chakras are located at points where the energy strands cross 14 times
6158545 they were electrical activations of the sequential record of consciousness a record that had been laid down during the patients earlier experience the patient re lived all that he had been aware of in that earlier period of time as in a moving picture flashback
6158546 each time i re stimulated she heard the melody again it began at the same place and went on from chorus to verse
6158547 since the electrode may activate a random sample of this strip from the distant past
6158548 and since the most unimportant and completely forgotten periods of time may appear in this sampling it seems reasonable to suppose that the record is complete and that it does include all periods of each individuals waking conscious life
6158549 by what power or powers were these early pyramids and temples constructed
6158550 by the lifting forces of those gases that are being used gradually in the present civilization and by the fine work or activities of those versed in that pertaining to the source from which all power comes
6158551 the more you praise and celebrate your life the more there is in life to celebrate
6158552 the skulls under consideration are not pre columbian they must surely be regarded as of relatively modern manufacture
6158553 each skull was probably worked not more than a decade before it was first offered for sale
6158554 i think of you every second every minute every waking hour of the day i worship you i pray to you i am with you
6158555 my throat hurts will you please find me some water
6158556 masonic symbolism of the arithmetical number five and its plane geometric construct the pentagram and solid geometric construct the dodecahedron
6158557 five churches or sacred sites are all built on hilltops on the site of older structures and form a perfect pentagon with its center near the megalithic sites known locally as balancing rock and the devils chair two of these five sites are the churches in rennes le chateau and bezu between them is the ruin at serre de lauzet with the chapel of blanchefort and the megalith at la soulane as the other two points
6158558 the five pointed star or the star polygon of the number five is made by marking five equidistant points on a circle and joining each to the next but one the lines and angles are equal the angles being 36 degrees 72 degrees and 108 degrees the sections of the lines exhibit the golden ratio by which a line is divided into extreme and mean ratio that ratio being 618 or 1 618 which plays so important and interesting a part in geometry in symbolism this figure is often taken as synonymous with the number five the pentad the pythagoreans called it the pentalpha because it was like five alphas a it combines the two and the three the first even and the first odd numbers after unity representing therefore among many other things on the universal plane the union of cosmic substance with cosmic intellect if the three is combined with the four another symbol of matter we get the seven as a union of five elements it stands for the heavenly or macrocosmic man and its five points correspond to the head and limbs of a mans body the same idea lies behind the five wounds of christ when the star has its point down it signifies the polar opposite of the preceding that is the nether or material pole of cosmic life and so can be used as a black magical symbol the horns of evil are said to be up the combination of these two produces the decad in a similar way to that by which the two triangles are combined in solomons seal and thus we get another symbol of mans dual nature and of the dual aspect of cosmic forces in connection with this astrologers will remember that each of five planets has two houses a day house and a night house while sun and moon have each one house so that we have here the five the ten and the twelve harmonized together five is specially important in our times because we are in the fifth root race and five elements have so far been manifested the fifth ether only partially as yet we have five digits on each limb five is the most frequent number for the petals of a flower we use the denary scale twice five and the number five plays a leading part in the geometry of the dodecahedron and icosahedron in the secret doctrine we find the pentagon used for the number five in the formula 31415 the other figures likewise being denoted by geometrical signs

6158562 no i dont even have a desk you cant sit down its fun
6158563 its always on the go because they have so much energy so ready to learn and excited to be here some their first time to even be in school so they are all geared up and pumped up and cant sit very long because they are five
6158564 it was a little scary at first we had some parents that came in with concern and i completely understood their concern

6158570 absolutely nowadays i dont think crytek could have set up
6158571 it wouldnt exist the situation has changed drastically the competition is more serious companies have consolidated costs have increased the platforms are getting more difficult to enter
6158572 for example to make a next gen pc title entering the market now wed need about eur 10 12 million even for a newcomer to make an fps as good as far cry was back then to get the trust and commitment from a publisher for a newby studio i think its quite impossible
6158573 from the concept perspective dont rely on anything thats about realism or technology focus on something that involves creativity and gameplay
6158574 the second thing on the business perspective i would suggest looking at digital distribution whether its you or a publisher distributing it it doesnt matter but prepare for that market then youve already narrowed down your choice of platforms which is either pc mobile iphone modding potentially xbla and psn
6158575 i think the number one thing we learned was to be agile and iterative we knew that already but that thought was confirmed
6158576 always stay independent agile and iterative but when i say that it doesnt mean necessarily being independent of a publisher but being having the ability to make decisions
6158577 if you want to make iterations it means you need to be able to cycle through changes quickly and again you cant need to ask somebody before you make changes so it doesnt necessarily mean financial or business independence thats one idea to aim for but also within the structure of the company
6158578 coaches havent really talked to me about it its more of a personal thing its my senior year i feel i need to be more productive i wasnt real happy with how i played last year i worked hard this summer and through camp and i feel like ive taken big strides

6158603 i think we can provide a level of resources that will move the tool forward in a big way the first thing we are doing is continuing to offer the software to the community for free downloading the second thing is giving our product management and usability teams the task of going out into the community to get suggestions on how we can make this amazing tool even better we accept the fact that there will be scepticism but we can point to a good track record of support for the community people were wary a couple of years ago when we purchased the sql server central community site but over time we have won over many of our critics by investing heavily in the site and boosting its readership while allowing it to maintain editorial independence im hoping i will be able to sit here in a few years time and claim the same level of success with reflector

6158758 with a solar oven in the yard villagers do not need to spend time collecting sticks or wood in order to boil water or cook potatoes
6158759 farmers still have to buy coal for heat and cooking but a solar oven reduces the quantity of burning sticks grass and wood that are very precious in the drought stricken mountain areas
6158760 geared toward reducing reliance on firewood and preserving the pristine headwaters of many of asias largest rivers they also offer a clean alternative to fire pits and traditional stoves
6158761 the local participants and students became highly encouraged and showed their interest for generating awareness about solar cooking among the local people after the completion of this program organizations are frequently requesting to dr mukhopadhyay for conduction such program so that they can adopt the technique for cooking their daily foods from discussions with local people it is obvious that the program will go a long way towards creation of awareness of the villagers
6158762 develop a strategy for the optimal use of carbon credits to make solar equipment affordable for the users
6158763 build an effective incentive structure for the correct and constant use of solar applications

6158783 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
6158784 hes got to be very concerned by the neck in neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
6158785 over the last week weve seen sen obamas lead in the poll of polls cut in half
6158786 this change was likely driven by a renewed focus on foreign policy after russias invasion of georgia as well as by sen mccains willingness to launch more aggressive attacks against obama on issues such as off shore drilling
6158787 since obama returned from his overseas trip it seems like mccain has thrown all the punches clearly the blows have landed in recent days obama is fighting back going after mccain on the economy the issue voters care about most mccain has changed the dynamic of the race heading into the two conventions that puts more pressure on obama to go to denver and effectively define himself and mccain

6158798 we have not received any such letter from the delhi government as yet but security has already been beefed up at temples across the capital
6158799 security has been increased in consultation with temple authorities security personnel have been deployed door frame metal detectors and cctvs have been installed at various temples
6158800 we received a letter last week from the lieutenant governor appealing to us to take steps to increase security around religious places during the festival season especially on occasions when there are large crowds

6158807 i think its wonderful that theyre going to reach out and offer assistance to families that may need it but i really never expected anything from the army so getting this letter was a surprise

6158880 theres body parts of other animals in there bones eyes tongues cheeks its just incredible
6158881 this had better turn pink grow nipples and give me a lapdance soon
6158882 i dont really know how to explain it to be honest with you
6158883 i think its my fifth time in china ive been popular here since 99 but this summer i didnt know i was this big
6158884 theres not much of a chance only a very very small one
6158885 you look at our team and up and down the lineup we had guys who could fight
6158886 without really thinking about it a lot id say our team was the best but when you hear the names of the guys who fought on that 84 team whew ill tell you its hard to pick im not really sure honestly
6158887 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent
6158888 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6158889 your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6158890 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6158891 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries
6158892 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6158893 obviously what we had wasnt working might as well try something else
6158894 you might not be able to print what i think about them
6158895 they thought he was going to be the savior the miracle man
6158896 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent

6158899 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6158900 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries

6158903 you might not be able to print what i think about them
6158904 they thought he was going to be the savior the miracle man
6158905 we appreciate all that fernando has done for this team over the last four years and wish him and his family the best
6158906 he has worked tirelessly on behalf of our organization and brought us some of our greatest successes
6158907 i dont really know how to explain it to be honest with you
6158908 i think its my fifth time in china ive been popular here since 99 but this summer i didnt know i was this big
6158909 what eventually happens to our fish and wildlife is what can happen to us
6158910 he always manages to capture incredibly hot performances from his cast from the beginning i loved his script and ideas for this film and was happy to work it into the barely legal lineup
6158911 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year

6158918 you suck at cards you are a loser how could you not have folded that hand you donkey stick to your day job you have no hope
6158919 im sorry i can tell you how to get enrolled in our mental health services and then you would have a case worker who could help you with payee but if payee is all youre looking for we are not the right place
6158920 und es wird definitiv ein gro er part unseres spiels werden ja
6158921 does evil exist and if so how should we deal with it
6158922 evil does exist i mean i think we see evil all the time we see evil in darfur we see evil sadly on the streets of our cities we see evil in parents who viciously abuse their children i think it has to be confronted it has to be confronted squarely and one of the things that i strongly believe is that now we are not going to as individuals be able to erase evil from the world that is gods task but we can be soldiers in that process and we can confront it when we see it now the one thing that i think is very important is for to us have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil because a lot of evils been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
6158923 defeat it a couple of points one if im president of the united states my friends if i have to follow him to the gates of hell i will get bin laden and bring him to justice i will do that and i know how to do that i will get that done applause no one no one should be allowed to take thousands of american innocent american lives of course evil must be defeated my friends we are facing the transcended challenge of the 21st century radical islamic extremism not long ago in baghdad al qaida took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is and were going to defeat this evil and the central battleground according to david petraeus and osama bin laden is the battle is baghdad mosul basra and iraq and we are winning and succeeding and our troops will come home with honor and with victory and not in defeat and thats whats happening
6158924 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6158925 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6158926 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6158927 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6158928 we have given ours the other side has given theirs
6158929 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
6158930 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
6158931 we paid them the money the night before the press conference they didnt figure id have a turbo heater on that thing to thaw it out before they left california
6158932 it was the most macabre thing youve ever seen in your life
6158933 theres body parts of other animals in there bones eyes tongues cheeks its just incredible
6158934 warrants need to be issued immediately before biscardi leaves the country
6158935 santa clara county california where the press conference was held clearly has jurisdiction to issue the warrants and all the elements of fraud are present
6158936 at this time i am breaking any association or cooperation with tom biscardi and his company
6158937 people ask me if biscardi was complicit in this hoax i honestly believe he was not
6158938 confidence in the war on terror and on the situation in iraq is at the highest level of the last four years
6158939 who would have thought a year ago iraq would not have been an absolute lay down issue for barack obama
6158940 now accept drilling as a necessary evil for the lack of a better phrase
6158941 the biggest thing that changed the race was john mccains call for offshore oil drilling
6158942 it is not about offshore drilling per se but people are looking at the price of gas as the driving force in all conversations about the economy and the fact that john mccain was looking for a new policy that was aggressively trying to find new energy was a positive economic policy
6158943 their main duty was to fight against terrorism and gun running drug trafficking that was there main duty when it was set up you know this is a very large area and we dont have a quite big number of battle ships
6158944 we are trying to avoid communication with the ship at the moment until the course is clear until we find out who are they who are holding them and why are they holding them and where exactly they are because we dont want to put the lives of the seamen in danger
6158945 we need to set up our military especially the coast guard we need swift boats we have the manpower but we dont have financial capability to catch all these things
6158946 extraordinary sessions can only be called by the president ould cheikh abdallahi who remains captive since the august 6 coup
6158947 this country has been led by the army for 30 years before the presidential elections of march 2007 that everybody said were transparent
6158948 i only managed to leave gaza in april when i trained in amman for one month and then one month in china as part of the olympic solidarity programme
6158949 im not happy with my result but thats all due to a lack of competition
6158950 when youre away and out of competition like this you cant compete against the champions
6158951 i kept pace for the first 2000m but after that i needed to show more endurance which i didnt have because of my lack of competition
6158952 i am proud to represent palestine but its not enough
6158953 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6158954 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6158955 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6158956 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6158957 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6158958 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6158959 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6158960 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6158961 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6158962 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6158963 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6158964 i dont think ive ever heard a liberal saying that people dont support barack because of racism unless its blatant thats some weird thing you right wingers have manufactured yourselves
6158965 some people wont vote for me because i dont look like the rest of the guys on the currency
6158966 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
6158967 whoever wins this nomination i am going to campaign my heart out for
6158968 3 hillary supporters are generally not the nutty left wing bats that make obamas base and dream of a socialist paradise they would probably just settle for a half decent president
6158969 with a sitting republican president the democratic frontrunner is always ahead in the polls at this time of the year this should be especially true with bushs low approval rating
6158970 see youre the perfect example of why mccain should be worried you actually think obama is an anti american bigot and im sure there are plenty more that share your views and even with all that blind ignorance mccain cant build and hold a real lead against a guy whose first name is out of mortal kombat middle name is the same as our former thorn in the side and last name is one letter off the most hated man
6158971 who would you rather have in charge of the defense of the united states of america a group of people who never served a day overseas in their life or a guy who served his country honorably and has three purple hearts and a silver star on the battlefields of vietnam
6158972 republicans can keep economy going by cutting taxes dems want to take that away
6158973 not that much different than bush in terms of voting
6158974 oh let me get your names and you can be on the guestlist since you guys are 21 next time and you dont have to pay

6158976 american hoaxers used a rubber gorilla suit frozen in a block of ice to pretend they had found the remains of bigfoot it was revealed today two men claimed last week that they had found the body of bigfoot in the woods of georgia the 2 3m 7ft 7in corpse encased in ice was sold to tom biscardi a bigfoot tracker for an undisclosed sum after he was shown a dna sample purported to have been taken from the remains
6158977 el avi n se ha desintegrado y hemos evitado que algunos ardieran entre los restos
6158978 ha sido un accidente en una zona de dif cil acceso en un arroyo arbolado y hemos rescatado a las v ctimas que hemos podido
6158979 la verdad es que es duro normalmente atendemos incidencias sin mucha importancia y cosas de esta envergadura te dejan muy marcado
6158980 el avi n se ha desintegrado pr cticamente pero al partirse hemos podido sacar a gente del r o y hemos evitado que ardieran alrededor de veinte personas hemos podido rescatar del accidente
6158981 yo habl con pedja mijatovic y con ram n calder n y me han dicho que robinho se tiene que quedar que no se puede marchar entonces no podemos hacer nada porque tiene dos a os de contrato con el real madrid
6158982 robinho nunca dijo que no disfruta en el madrid pero el hecho es que tiene una oferta econ mica m s interesante es solamente eso
6158983 s tengo que decir que hasta el 31 de agosto todo es posible hasta que no se cierre el plazo de fichajes no damos el asunto por cerrado el presidente ram n calder n le prometi a robinho que si presentaba en el club una oferta de 40 millones de euros lo dejar a salir

6158985 true love is when you have to watch a friend leave with the knowledge that you might never see him her again but you know he shell be in your mind and heart forever
6158986 please tell your brother how inspired i was by his book i loved how positive and uplifting his message was
6158987 too bad obama didnt use the same tone when he talked about parenting he might not have rubbed so many folks the wrong way
6158988 its just that youve never felt any sort of judgment coming with run
6158989 youre so used to him promoting love and acceptance through runs house that you were open to everything you read in the book
6158990 high commissioner john dauth has apologised to miss clark who has accepted the apology
6158991 miss clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and that she had had a bit of a laugh
6158992 she is renowned for her managerial skills the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes
6158993 she was the most delicate pretty innocent naive person you could ever meet
6158994 the first person i spoke to positively identified kerry they described what she was wearing and said she was carrying a cat carry cage
6158995 then it was just a matter of getting police there
6158996 i dont think im brave i was just convinced that what had happened wasnt right
6158997 you couldnt meet a more kind and compassionate person than kerry

6159000 the new file system flash driver combination when working with any of the memory chips and the os provides faster booting downloading and searching
6159001 she brought a salacious lawsuit against me and my firm solely to deflect attention from her criminal misdeeds and to attempt to embarrass me into paying her off
6159002 proven entirely false that guilty plea and her felony record are the ultimate repudiation of her disgusting lies
6159003 the whiskey will make you forget you were hungry to begin with
6159004 we couldnt possibly make a deliberate decision about every one of our actions so its not surprising that occasionally we do something hypocritical
6159005 hypocrisy is surprising when it involves a fundamental value or something thats publicly important
6159006 its become a way of supporting your argument in a strange sort of way
6159007 people think that whatever your principles are you should believe in them
6159008 there have been hypocritical people who were great leaders and there have been sincere people who were terrible leaders
6159009 president bush was not hypocritical in leading us into war in iraq but thats turned out to be a disaster
6159010 someone who is vocally critical of others is concealing something about himself
6159011 you cant simply resolve to stop judging others or to stop being a hypocrite
6159012 finding fault with yourself is also the key to overcoming the hypocrisy and judgmentalism that damage so many valuable relationships
6159013 stfu im mary jane yooooooooko and my boyfriend looks just like brad pitt
6159014 gives shiraishi the death glare i really liked this ep and imo i think it rivaled last episode in terms of emotions it was mainly saejimas story this episode and she pulled it off wonderfully 3 i just hate how she speaks treats shiraishi though
6159015 hanno dei fucili e cacciano e molto noioso allevano anche delle galline e il loro solo interesse tu cerchi delle galline
6159016 tu fino ad ora per me non sei che un ragazzino uguale a centomila ragazzini e non ho bisogno di te e neppure tu hai bisogno di me io non sono per te che una volpe uguale a centomila volpi ma se tu mi addomestichi noi avremo bisogno luno dellaltro tu sarai per me unico al mondo e io saro per te unica al mondo
6159017 ma non ho molto tempo pero ho da scoprire degli amici e da conoscere molte cose
6159018 gli uomini non hanno piu tempo per conoscere nulla comprano dai mercanti le cose gia fatte ma siccome non esistono mercanti di amici gli uomini non hanno piu amici se tu vuoi un amico addomesticami
6159019 in principio tu ti sederai un po lontano da me cosi nellerba
6159020 se tu vieni per esempio tutti i pomeriggi alle quattro dalle tre io comincero ad essere felice col passare dellora aumentera la mia felicita quando saranno le quattro incomincero ad agitarmi e ad inquietarmi scopriro il prezzo della felicita ma se tu vieni non si sa quando io non sapro mai a che ora prepararmi il cuore ci vogliono i riti
6159021 e quello che fa un giorno diverso dagli altri giorni unora dalle altre ore ce un rito per esempio presso i miei cacciatori il giovedi ballano con le ragazze del villaggio allora il giovedi e un giorno meraviglioso io mi spingo sino alla vigna se i cacciatori ballassero in un giorno qualsiasi i giorni si assomiglierebbero tutti e non avrei mai vacanza
6159022 io non ti volevo far del male ma tu hai voluto che ti addomesticassi
6159023 va a rivedere le rose capirai che la tua rosa e unica al mondo quando ritornerai a dirmi addio ti regalero un segreto
6159024 voi non siete per niente simili alla mia rosa voi non siete ancora niente
6159025 nessuno vi ha addomesticato e voi non avete addomesticato nessuno voi siete come era la mia volpe non era che una volpe uguale a centomila altre ma ne ho fatto un mio amico e ora e per me unica al mondo
6159026 non si puo morire per voi certamente un qualsiasi passante crederebbe che la mia rosa vi assomigli ma lei lei sola e piu importante di tutte voi perch e lei che ho innaffiata perch e lei che ho messa sotto la campana di vetro perch e lei che ho riparata col paravento perch su di lei ho ucciso i bruchi salvo i due o tre perle farfalle perch e lei che ho ascoltato lamentarsi o vantarsi o anche qualche volta tacere perch e la mia rosa
6159027 ecco il mio segreto e molto semplice non si vede bene che col cuore lessenziale e invisibile agli occhi
6159028 e il tempo che tu hai perduto per la tua rosa che ha fatto la tua rosa cosi importante

6159030 it is the spectacle of people who might be different thats all it is
6159031 the tourists appear to have little regard for the neighborhood and its residents and view the stop as akin to visiting a zoo or other attraction where they are entertained by exhibits or animals
6159032 the tour guide told me to stop there for about 20 minutes so they can get out
6159033 many of them seem uncomfortable or shocked by their surroundings
6159034 youve got these throngs of people walking up and down market and 18th holding hands to make it clear that they are heterosexual
6159035 they come in here 15 or 20 at a time
6159036 they look around take a picture and then they walk out in the last three months ive sold one bottle of water it is not worth having so much traffic were not a photo album
6159037 the guy from muni says it is already illegal to park there
6159038 but now he says we have to make it officially illegal its absurd
6159039 they were unhappy with the situation and they wanted it stopped
6159040 well just get the sisters of perpetual indulgence on this
6159041 a few blessings from them and those tour buses would disappear
6159042 i really believe thats relevant to what we do as basketball players what are you prepared to do everybody wants to be an nba player but what are you prepared to do to make yourself become one of those guys
6159043 i went through jerrys notes of his conversation with robyn curry mother of recruit vinny zollo question by question

6159058 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal
6159059 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
6159060 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that
6159061 you come to do a burglary on a bus you do the burglary you take your guns and get back on the bus and go home
6159062 some of them may have said you know what i dont need to be a part of the army any more because they dont want me or they dont know how to treat me
6159063 well weve learned a lot and i think weve improved a lot and this is a way to reconnect with them
6159064 i think its wonderful that theyre going to reach out and offer assistance to families that may need it but i really never expected anything from the army so getting this letter was a surprise

6159072 they are not giving the milf any other option but to go back to their original option so whats the implication of this imagine if the war escalates not just north cotabato not just lanao norte but all of mindanao
6159073 i think its a political statement by the milf kolambugan used to be one of their first lines of defense in the 1974 75 war there used to be a big force of ilagas if you remember the war then the ilagas had managed to defend kolambugan so well and demilitarized after that
6159074 and what the milf has done is to show that it can still attack kolambugan and prove it can operate everywhere
6159075 my sense is that he is against it peace talks and the only problem is to be able to show that he is still a force to reckon with inside the organization somebody who has to be attended to
6159076 we filed the intervention because we wanted to impress upon the public that there is a constituency that supports the peace process as of now the public has only been reading and hearing the views of the anti moas we also filed it to set the historical antecedents of the moa of the grp milf peace process and of the mindanao conflict itself
6159077 the grp milf peace process has already taken twelve years this was marked by two all out military offensives in years 2000 and 2003 and countless major outbreaks of fighting which produced almost one million and 430 000 refugees respectively and thousands of homes ruined human casualties combatants and non combatants are indeterminate
6159078 the four decade long mindanao conflict is one of the most serious yet under reported conflicts in the world
6159079 ironic because this is a conflict of darfur and timorese proportions it has already cost more than 100 000 lives and millions of internally displaced persons
6159080 agreements and consensus points that would have led to an early successful conclusion of the talks have also been set aside due to pressure from conservatives and hawks
6159081 the grp milf talks are only the latest of numerous attempts to peacefully resolve by way of negotiations what is now the longest running armed conflict in asia but precisely because past efforts have failed this latest one may turn out to be the last one should it fail
6159082 time will come when even the peace groups even civil society will lose hope believe me i spend a lot of time there
6159083 it was a political statement if they really wanted to destroy the town they could have done more damage when they had full control from 10 am to 3 pm
6159084 this can of worms has also regurgitated another unsavory reality that has been with us ever since our forefathers fought the spaniards and their indio factotums servants the anti moro attitude of the filipinos we are aghast at the way filipino politicians whether in and out of government and with the help of the media have whipped up an anti moro anti muslim hysteria that has swept the whole country it is simply nauseating to see and hear on radio and tv these politicians blatantly and publicly distort the moa ad and turn it into propaganda to demonize the milf the bangsamoro people and islam
6159085 the moros will fight milf base commander ustadz amirul ombra cato will not be alone a war in mindanao will drag down this pathetic artificial country and its government to perdition perhaps this time we will no longer settle for a sub state or a federative arrangement with the filipinos its useless anyway because they would never grant it they would always insist this is secession even if we do not have the intention to secede so lets give them a dose of their own medicine lets aim for independence this time
6159086 they grp should do the final signing of the moa ad one word is enough for a wise man wheres justice it is they who did not keep their word

6159096 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
6159097 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6159098 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
6159099 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good
6159100 part of my reason for going into medicine was to work overseas i was a bit of an adventurer as a student i did an elective on the afghan pakistan border
6159101 it may not immediately be apparent that working in war zones or developing countries is somewhere you can push back medical frontiers or be very innovative but i feel its even more important in these situations
6159102 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6159103 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6159104 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6159105 the effect on grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets
6159106 pharmacists will usually draw this matter to patients attention when dispensing their medicines this new research showing that apple and orange juice may enhance or reduce the effects of some medicines is interesting but it is only one study
6159107 usually further research is needed to establish that these interactions are significant
6159108 the observation is very interesting it will need more work to establish how important such interactions are in clinical practice and for what drugs and juices
6159109 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive
6159110 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6159111 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6159112 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6159113 the key with treating any type of cancer is being able to decide on the best treatment for an individual patient we welcome the findings of this study which could take us a step closer towards an era of more personalised medicine
6159114 collagen basically gives strength and support to the skin it makes the skin supple and elastic with age you produce less collagen and the collagen that you have becomes destroyed and of course this is accelerated with chronic exposure to the sun
6159115 the impact on the energy market has been significant as demonstrated by the momentous jump in gas and electricity prices the amount of gas available to export from norway to countries including the uk will be cut significantly and without adequate storage the uk will be left to negotiate with russia and the far east for supplies or risk running low on energy

6159122 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6159123 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today never before in our history as a province have we been prepared to take these important steps toward self reliance
6159124 there will be no more giveaways in this province we are not going to do a bad deal
6159125 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as i approve this message
6159126 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6159127 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6159128 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6159129 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6159130 they have to do it a little more craftily than in the past but it wouldnt be too hard for them the conservatives to set a trap for the liberals
6159131 prime minister stephen harper can engineer the defeat of his government in 30 seconds
6159132 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6159133 we did establish a fixed date for the next election that said in this minority parliament two of the parties the bloc qu b cois and the ndp have indicated for some months now that they want an election immediately mr dion has indicated that the government has to be defeated but hes not sure when hell do that because he hasnt got good enough polls i dont think thats a particularly responsible position
6159134 a lot of patience and because i struck at the right time
6159135 a bit of reform party hocus pocus so now harper is caught in that but not really caught
6159136 he wants to get the opposition especially the liberals to put up or shut up
6159137 and so this is a lot of posturing and chest beating on behalf of both harper and dion
6159138 i dont think the liberals can continue to play the same game
6159139 now that stage is over and mr dion is the one who has to make a tough decision

6159152 and we know that a bike trip can change a persons life
6159153 it slows down the pace of life and allows one to observe to become connected to the communities
6159154 we decided to combine the things we do best lead bike trips and provide great experiences with the critical issues of climate change access to renewable energy bicycle advocacy and how americans are going to address their energy future
6159155 the result is a bicycle philanthropy ride with the added element of an expert speaker series not only will our climate riders pedal they will have the opportunity to learn and engage in the issues

6159215 your ministry has been a wealth of information during my sermon series preparation on the death of discernment there is so much to cover i liken it to our recent trip to new york we saw 50 major landmarks and we only scratched the surface

6159217 how have we reached this crisis point in the church
6159218 today this viewpoint dominates the seminaries in america the bible is studied not to be believed and obeyed but to be analyzed dissected and criticized the result is that the scriptures have lost their authority
6159219 infiltration and deception have been tools of conspirators through the ages and the church has been a primary target after all god warns us that the whole world is under the sway of the evil one i john 5 19 one of his most effective schemes is to redefine gods word and divert christians from his unchanging truth to mans shifting ideals
6159220 dont spend too much time focusing on the deception but rather on the truth

6159222 here a guy is running and its all about pacing you want to keep him in the zone you want to keep his attention but at the same time theres much more room to spread out than on a record i might produce for a club
6159223 ive been mostly working on up tempo electro tracks as of late but my background is hip hop and i think you can hear it in my choice of sounds
6159224 i wanted this record to showcase my current style but i also didnt want to stray away from hip hop completely thats why you find guest rap verses plenty of chopped and screwed vocals and a hefty dose of drum breaks that are surely more block party than ibiza
6159225 ive never been threatening to people who understand where im coming from that being said nobody is rapping like me nobody what im saying is 10 times more powerful than what theyre saying
6159226 laugh now cry later and has just released what he is touting as his political manifesto
6159227 i think that when i released my last record i had more to prove than expecting to step back into the role that i was in you have to have people listening before you can start speaking
6159228 i felt like since 93 political hip hop has been pushed into the background for escapism hip hop now i think the climate is that people are looking for answers or even just where the problem is coming from thats what im trying to spit
6159229 i know the blames definitely to be expected because we are an easy target we are a group of entertainers who go by our own minds we dont go by societys minds and standards
6159230 we talk about the good we talk about the bad we talk about the ugly he says
6159231 thats the part people dont like the ugly so people are always gonna attack us for that we use profanity oh my god thats just taboo in american society i know the blames to be expected but its just silly to attack the mirror when youre the one thats ugly
6159232 a major label isnt gonna do anything for you except put you in a nice video
6159233 raw footage on his own independent label lench mob records and encourages new artists to do the same
6159234 if you got the money you should figure it out for yourself he says
6159235 people buying music direct from the artist its like buying it out of the trunk again the major music chains have done a great job of trying to stomp out this music by coming in buying all the mom and pops and then the major labels closed down so artists are gonna have to have their own form of delivery
6159236 raw footage which thankfully do not bear the stigma of overproduction and ghost writers found in much of modern hip hop whats left is unfiltered cube that to some music industry execs could seem very very threatening
6159237 when all youve got is mtv and bet you cant get our message out there he says
6159238 to be on those networks you gotta go through their censors so now they control the industry but now with the new way of information that is free flowing you can put out your release how you really want it
6159239 if you see one of my new videos they just seem rawer than anything else but theyre not its just that everything else has been censored

6159270 the universitys athletic department was under investigation for some pretty serious allegations i think the public is entitled to fully know what happened in that investigation
6159271 fsu is a public university and therefore any record generated relating to the official business of the university is subject to the states open records act
6159272 florida state university is cooperating with the ncaa in its ongoing investigation which includes a notice of allegations fsu is preparing a response as requested by the ncaa we intend to transmit the universitys response to the ncaa on or before sept 12 at that time the university will provide a copy of its report to the public as permitted under applicable privacy laws

6159277 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6159278 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6159279 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6159298 fox would rather see watchmen killed instead of collecting a percentage at the box office
6159299 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
6159300 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6159301 did not opine at all on the merits other than to conclude that fox satisfied the pleading requirements
6159302 it is particularly noteworthy that nothing on the face of the complaint or the documents supplied to the court establishes that watchmen producer larry gordon the claimed source of warner brothers interest in watchmen ever acquired any rights in watchmen

6159379 im thinking particularly of the worship sharing at canadian yearly meeting which broke out tuesday night after the ecology panel presentation friends spoke movingly of our world as the titanic the iceberg already struck the poor folk on the lower decks already drowning friends spoke of letting go of attachment to unjustly acquired and maintained comforts and security that underlie this crisis for the last three years well before joining quakers ive been under great concern about environmental catastrophe and the future of human civilization frankly i wondered whether i was going mad the world as we know it is appears to be coming to an end but in all the media in conversations with family friends and colleagues i encountered at most a dim superficial awareness of the issues if not vehement or mocking denial that left me feeling acutely isolated and powerless i was afraid to raise the issue afraid of sounding like a lunatic street corner jeremiah nevertheless with support from friends ive been finding my voice but to be in a room with over a hundred friends who get it who have the courage to put aside glib denial to wade into that scary swamp in pursuit of the truth that ministered to me deeply knowing that i am now part of this courageous and loving family
6159380 the convictions of the first friends were what ordered their theo political imagination as cavanugh calls it this imagination guided their practice their missionary inspired anti constantinian message that christ had retunred and is the head of the church the head of the church is not the state its not learned clergy but christ alone the quaker narrative is not complete without this realization their convictions drew on something else looked back to something other which sought to reinstate the reality of gods kingdom here and now when we seek to simply reinstate or draw on the origins of quakerism or our other traditions we forego even silence the actual well spring the experience that these first generation friends drew on if we miss this we run the risk of silencing an essential feature of their message early quakerism saw itself as restoring early christianity as a result if this is ignored well continue to struggle to find a quakerism with the force and motivation of early friends well flounder as we try to have a quakerism worth believing in

6159424 for now the problem at hand remains the housing crisis and the banking credit crisis but in our view as time passes the odds will continue to grow that all of these problems morph into an even more serious currency crisis in this vein we view the current strength in the us dollar as ultra transitory and opening the door for the federal reserve to begin its next wave of interest rate cuts aimed at supporting the banking system and wall street as more defaults are seen in coming months the fed in our view will have little choice but to begin monetizing these problems and creating fresh doses of digital dollars all out of thin air for helicopter ben the new super duper helo is about ready to lift off with one mission and one mission only paper over all of the bad debts and keep the system from bursting at the seams for the us dollar the path of least resistance will once again be a relentless slide to new lows this time likely accompanied by rising long term interest rates as foreign capital abandons the long ensconced patterns of mercantilism and vendor finance the torpedo explosions now resonating throughout the bulkheads of the sinking gses cannot be ignored as the unwinding of derivative positions at these institutions could well be the trigger event to place foreign capital into full retreat with balance sheet impairment and collapse will follow debt downgrades and the beginning of a potential exodus a run from us gse agency paper fingers have been plugging up the damn thus far but the pressure behind the walls appears ready to burst for those who think the markets have been volatile in the last few weeks get ready cause we believe you havent seen anything yet

6159489 and what about the so called pests the green yellow and black striped larvae of the black swallowtail that you may see in your vegetable garden feeding on parsley petroselinum crispum dill anethum graveolens and carrot tops daucus carota are often considered a nuisance these caterpillars originally fed only on native plants such as angelica angelica but they have also adapted to eat nonnative herbs in the parsley family apiaceae so all a gardener needs to do is scatter a few extra patches of parsley and dill throughout the garden to disperse the caterpillars and allow for their huge appetites

6159510 despite the strong headline number for retail sales if you look at it in real terms stripping out the price effects retail sales were actually down
6159511 is consistent with an economy thats just struggling to turn out growth of any variety
6159512 it now looks like gdp gross domestic product managed to eke out a tiny advance in the second quarter
6159513 the underlying story in this retail sales report is consistent with that
6159514 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6159515 what we saw through the second quarter is that exports and manufacturing really pulled up the slack in the economy
6159516 were expecting that to be really the driver of any growth that we see going forward
6159517 the leading indicators for the second month in a row were flat
6159518 signalling modest growth at best in the second half of the year
6159519 well probably see the economy over the next couple of months treading water

6159532 i had a great script from this writer named michael sullivan that needed a little work but when the strike happened we couldnt sit down and work on it so we pitched it out to a couple of comic book companies
6159533 what were doing is guiding the overall story what mark powers is doing is taking the source material which is the story by michael sullivan and cutting loose creating this huge world with its individual struggle and the weight of the world on this one guys shoulders
6159534 i can see it in a number of different ways i mean it could be a movie it could be a digital series it could be a tv show or it could just be a great comic thats the thing that i think myself and my partner are very much wanting to do just make a good book he knows how passionate i am about comics and graphic novels thats all we want to do just make a really good book
6159535 its funny its like you have one entrance in and now you get a couple of opportunities
6159536 i was a huge comic book fan when i was a kid i went to a place called fidonia funnies in orange county once a week with my dad its nice to be able to give back i feel like im contributing to a bit of the world that raised me in a sense
6159537 its bizarre i was a fan first and now im working with these guys in a sense or playing their subject matter but its absolutely exciting
6159538 if they called me and said do you want to play spider man of course i would
6159539 i was actually having a conversation last night with marvel studios chairman david maisel and he was talking about iron man he was basically saying that its a character piece where the guy just happens to be a superhero
6159540 i think as long as we here on heroes or anybody who is making movies about comics and superheroes stay with the struggle of the character then all the extraordinary events that surround them are just going to add to the reason why people are drawn into these stories so they can watch these characters go through things
6159541 being invited into the world of comic books i often feel like the hollywood industry is looked at sometimes with squinted eyes when were trying to walk into a place that we havent been before
6159542 so i have no fear of jumping into it going from heroes to playing a superhero in anything else that i do you know its kind of cool you want to be a superhero when you grow up
6159543 as long as we are persistent in our pursuit of our deepest destiny we will continue to grow we cannot choose the day or time when we will fully bloom it happens in its own time

6159674 we havent done the sinatra stuff out there its great to have all this classy new material
6159675 ah trabajar n compa eros de base y encargados de las oficinas para seguir manteniendo el trabajo normal de la presidencia nacional del partido
6159676 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
6159677 estoy bien loca porque en el foro de la p gina oficial ya les dije que hagamos una marcha mundial y me rega aron que por qu ando haciendo cosas as
6159678 les dije que el 23 de agosto hagamos una marcha en todos los pa ses para que esto no se acabe mi vida se llama rbd no s qu va a pasar son cosas del destino que no est n a nuestro alcance
6159679 aqu s lo hay hermanos nosotros no tenemos conflictos no pienso en una carrera como solista no tengo cabeza para eso me duele estoy pasando por un duro momento
6159680 yo digo que los que vamos para el concierto debemos hacer pancartas y eso que demuestren nuestro desacuerdo por la separaci n y nuestro apoyo a ellos
6159681 la verdad me parece prematura la separaci n as que hagamos algo y si van a hacer marcha s lo digan d nde y ah estar
6159682 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
6159683 ross played for me at notre dame in his first two seasons 2005 06 and he was a hard nosed disciplined ball player
6159684 hes a very intelligent young man and he will be a tremendous asset to our program in many areas
6159685 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
6159686 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
6159687 you have not been a good boy you wont get any dessert
6159688 you do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother
6159689 how can i give sean hannety more talking points for his evening barrage
6159690 if you treat your body well the body will treat you well
6159691 ive never been threatening to people who understand where im coming from that being said nobody is rapping like me nobody what im saying is 10 times more powerful than what theyre saying
6159692 laugh now cry later and has just released what he is touting as his political manifesto
6159693 i think that when i released my last record i had more to prove than expecting to step back into the role that i was in you have to have people listening before you can start speaking
6159694 i felt like since 93 political hip hop has been pushed into the background for escapism hip hop now i think the climate is that people are looking for answers or even just where the problem is coming from thats what im trying to spit
6159695 i know the blames definitely to be expected because we are an easy target we are a group of entertainers who go by our own minds we dont go by societys minds and standards
6159696 we talk about the good we talk about the bad we talk about the ugly he says
6159697 thats the part people dont like the ugly so people are always gonna attack us for that we use profanity oh my god thats just taboo in american society i know the blames to be expected but its just silly to attack the mirror when youre the one thats ugly
6159698 a major label isnt gonna do anything for you except put you in a nice video
6159699 raw footage on his own independent label lench mob records and encourages new artists to do the same
6159700 if you got the money you should figure it out for yourself he says
6159701 people buying music direct from the artist its like buying it out of the trunk again the major music chains have done a great job of trying to stomp out this music by coming in buying all the mom and pops and then the major labels closed down so artists are gonna have to have their own form of delivery
6159702 raw footage which thankfully do not bear the stigma of overproduction and ghost writers found in much of modern hip hop whats left is unfiltered cube that to some music industry execs could seem very very threatening
6159703 when all youve got is mtv and bet you cant get our message out there he says
6159704 to be on those networks you gotta go through their censors so now they control the industry but now with the new way of information that is free flowing you can put out your release how you really want it
6159705 if you see one of my new videos they just seem rawer than anything else but theyre not its just that everything else has been censored
6159706 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being
6159707 i feel now at 53 i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
6159708 i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time
6159709 the practice of using infants like guinea pigs for drug testing must end
6159710 if you are rich in this country you go to a private doctor and you certainly dont put your child up to be experimented on
6159711 el riesgo de que no tengamos la amplitud ni la fortaleza humana t cnica y material que establece la ley para cumplir a satisfacci n nuestras obligaciones
6159712 nuestra labor ha significado el construir una relaci n con los concesionarios de radio y televisi n en un escenario ba ado por la pol mica y el descontento por la reforma en s misma
6159713 por el contrario en un acto que en lo personal lo considero ilegal porque est incumpliendo el presupuesto de egresos la secretar a argument una disminuci n en m s de 40 por ciento de lo programado para la implementaci n de la reforma
6159714 oh sorry i didnt take the time to figure out
6159715 no scientifically i do not believe its a human being until x
6159716 yes i believe it is a human being at x point
6159717 the empire for many people was the major sense of their existence now its no more
6159718 it was regarded as poor retarded you know just underdeveloped and so on
6159719 now under mr putin russia has finally emerged as a more or less well to do nation but it wanted to have the feeling that now it will be regarded by the other nations differently with more respect
6159720 washington has been neglecting the relationship with russia profoundly over the last eight years
6159721 weve had a situation time and time again when president bush has gone to a summit meeting you know declared his cooperation with his good friend president putin and then hes gone back to washington and nothing has happened
6159722 why for 15 years after the end of cold war west did do very little to make russia an ally and friend
6159723 every russian leader came to power saying reasonable things about the west and sooner or later something happens which will turn them anti american
6159724 i talk to my friends they basically say america is extremely selfish country and doesnt understand that other people may have different ideas different agendas different approaches
6159725 they do not trust that this effort undertaken by the u s in europe is against iran or against terrorist launches
6159726 they still think that this is against russia why what is the reason that instead of inviting both nations to cooperate closely they fight each other on that
6159727 all of them are in a stupor because they dont know what to say they dont want to speak out and support russia but on the other hand they dont want to come out and oppose russia
6159728 im a work in progress id never been to church until i met heidi
6159729 she got me to go it was a big step the walls shook a little bit as i first cruised in but jesus and i are making the connection
6159730 im trying to live a more positive holy life but it takes work
6159731 and im like jesus gave me these great comebacks and shes like no thats the devil apologize
6159732 you know i didnt need to go to the throat on her thats just part of this industry
6159733 the one time in your life when you can gain 50 pounds and people congratulate you
6159734 you should splurge on a really high end piece then one medium piece and a bunch of things to fill in
6159735 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
6159736 the demand for district residents who can fill green collar jobs is only expected to grow now dc workers and career and technical education students will be able to gain a valuable skill set that will benefit their careers and our citys green future
6159737 now when people ask me what a green collar job is i can point to specifics this training will lead to important results a greener more sustainable city and the jobs that go with it
6159738 the district is looking ahead to the future and were fortunate to have partners who want to bring hope to our young people
6159739 i cant even be showing you this youre totally out of the demo area but the world is there

6159744 i dont mind hard work youve got to work hard to generate something i dont think theres any secret to success if you show up in the right place at the right time and you put in a lot of time and effort and energy youre going to get something out of it its not brain surgery
6159745 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6159746 by turning troubled loans into performing loans they enhance their overall value

6159759 ellen gedalius is a talented writer and communicator her work ethic experience and knowledge of the tampa bay area will serve the community well as we advocate for a change in the direction of the country high quality affordable health care and access to education

6159761 the damage affects a computer system used by a government entity for national security purposes

6159763 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
6159764 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
6159765 the collaboration between microsoft and novell has been built on our desire to meet our customers real life it requirements
6159766 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to novells suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments
6159767 rachel is unbelievably talented and brilliant her breadth and depth of knowledge of politics and news is astonishing and im so excited to give her a place to really showcase what she can do
6159768 weve established msnbc as the place for politics and the destination for viewers who want the smartest take on the days developments adding rachel into our primetime lineup makes perfect sense
6159769 ive loved working with msnbc and being asked to host my own show is an amazing opportunity
6159770 when dan served as general manager he really laid the groundwork for msnbcs success today with ratings growing 62 percent under his watch
6159771 dan is the best legal analyst in the business our primetime focus is now politics so this move will enable dan to focus on what he does best
6159772 putting my g m hat back on i think this is absolutely the right call i look forward to my future success at nbc news
6159773 bob may be the most well known television anchor in colorado history but he always told me that he was most proud of the fact that he was a reporter
6159774 he was always asking questions and working to get to the truth
6159775 this confirms what a lot of recent studies have found no benefit of taking vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of heart disease and it raises a few red flags
6159776 we could not detect any preventive effect of intervention with folic acid plus vitamin b12 or with vitamin b6 on mortality or major cardiovascular events
6159777 there is no evidence that individuals should take b vitamins to decrease the risk of heart disease and there may be some evidence that they shouldnt
6159778 the observational data was great but the interventional studies were negative
6159779 we have been optimistic about the role of antioxidants such as vitamin b in preventing heart disease yet many of these large trials have shown that there is no benefit
6159780 but at this point it is certainly hard to recommend extra supplements when we dont have proof of benefit
6159781 what we can recommend is a diet with fruits and vegetables that have antioxidant vitamins in them

6159788 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes
6159789 to be one of the first participants in intels program is testimony to our commitment to the intel platform and the sme market
6159790 intel is simplifying the software decision making and buying process for smes which is in line with our goals our team has worked hard to deliver a product to achieve this certification

6159799 we are the first to show that you can do this to a single electron in a self assembled quantum dot
6159800 if youre going to do quantum computing you have to be able to work with one electron at a time
6159801 this dark state is a place where information can be stored without any error
6159802 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security
6159803 that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer
6159804 coherent population trapping of an electron spin in a single negatively charged quantum dot
6159805 with more than a quarter of the u s gross national product over 2 trillion sensitive to weather and climate events these events substantially impact our national health safety economy environment transportation systems and military readiness
6159806 all 50 states are impacted by these events and many of these events will be exacerbated by climate change
6159807 our concern is that our nation is not prepared for severe weather or climate change because of declining budgets and lack of attention to these threats over the past few years
6159808 we should improve our ability to respond to severe weather events and prepare for the impacts of climate change that will undoubtedly occur over the next several decades decision makers need information on how climate change will affect their local areas but we are hampered by a lack of funding observations and computing power to provide information at this local level
6159809 making our nation resilient to severe weather and climate change
6159810 given the costs of weather and climate disasters we believe these are wise and critical investments
6159811 we hope this study will increase awareness among researchers and help raise the bar on how we use wild animals in research
6159812 while wildlife researchers have made some great strides in addressing animal welfare concerns by using minimally obtrusive capture and handling techniques we found that some commonly used procedures still have potential to cause injury change normal behavior or more generally affect health in a negative manner
6159813 this finding warrants more detailed investigation of specific and cumulative effects of other stressors that bears may be exposed to during and after capture for example sample collection marking and carrying radiotransmitters
6159814 this finding is particularly important because as body condition fades so too does an animals potential for growth reproduction and survival
6159815 not only do researchers have a role to play but so do government wildlife agencies and funding agencies in supporting research to improve capture procedures and validate alternative techniques to capture

6159821 in dangers in doubts in difficulties think of mary call upon mary let not her name depart from your lips never suffer it to leave your heart and that you may more surely obtain the assistance of her prayer neglect not to walk in her footsteps with her for guide you shall never go astray while invoking her you shall never lose heart so long as she is in your mind you are safe from deception while she holds your hand you cannot fall under her protection you have nothing to fear if she walks before you you shall not grow weary if she shows you favor you shall reach the goal
6159822 if the hurricanes of temptation rise against you or you are running upon the rocks of trouble look to the star call on mary
6159823 love is sufficient of itself it gives pleasure by itself and because of itself it is its own merit its own reward love looks for no cause outside itself no effect beyond itself its profit lies in the practice of all the movements sensations and feelings of the soul love is the only one in which the creature can respond to the creator and make some sort of similar return however unequal though it be for when god loves all he desires is to be loved in return the sole purpose of his love is to be loved in the knowledge that those who love him are made happy by their love of him

6159844 al manar ini adalah media perjuangan melawan penindasan israel dan hizbullah yang dikategorikan sebagai teroris oleh pemerintah as adalah para pejuang kemerdekaan sama dengan para pejuang kita dahulu yang dikategorikan ekstremis oleh penjajah belanda
6159845 saya juga mohon as tidak bias menilai bahwa islam sama dengan teroris
6159846 kita diharapkan berdemokrasi dan itu kita jalankan termasuk juga dalam hal keterbukaan informasi karenanya saya juga inginkan masyarakat kita mendapat informasi bukan secara sepihak dan bukan dari sumber terbatas
6159847 saya juga yakin masyarakat kita cukup dewasa menilai informasi karenanya berikan saja kebebasan kepada mereka untuk memperoleh informasi dan biarkan transparan

6159849 marketers are frequently convinced that search engines and pay per click programs are genuine and reliable sources of visitors alternative ways of advertising are often being scouted thats so unnecessary after testing several different strategies of web promotion the results were unexpectedly surprising free adboards can provide you with 5 to 50 unique and very interesting visitors every day
6159850 hansabank has made great strides by offering highly customised content and product selections
6159851 we only launched the new net bank in april this year we have received a lot of positive feedback from our clients so far and the satisfaction of our clients with the net bank is also evident in the figures showing that more than 98 of our clients started using the new internet bank in the first month and a half the fact that we are already gaining recognition on the international level makes us even happier
6159852 even though we have done a great amount of work there is still a lot of work left to do we are a developing internet environment that wants to keep up with the needs of its clients new features will certainly be added to our internet bank and this will happen soon
6159853 christ arrives right on time to make this happen he didnt and doesnt wait for us to get ready he presented himself for this sacrificial death when we were far too weak and rebellious to do anything to get ourselves ready and even if we hadnt been so weak we wouldnt have known what to do anyway we can understand someone dying for a person worth dying for and we can understand how someone good and noble could inspire us to selfless sacrifice but god put his love on the line for us by offering his son in sacrificial death while we were of no use whatever to him
6159854 most american leaders since world war ii have felt a need to demonstrate their willingness to shed blood to protect or advance what they construe as the national interest
6159855 has shown him as a man capable of bold action
6159856 strength but instead by proving that they too want to prosecute wars just perhaps in different places or with different tactics as chairman of the foreign relations committee in 2002 biden also voted to authorize the attack on iraq
6159857 there are times it seems when joe biden can be damned near as dangerous as dick cheney
6159858 a civilized society is in large part defined by the justice and humanity of its law enforcement
6159859 our immigration law enforcement has ceased to be either just or humane
6159860 then ice has gone over the line of all decency we cannot allow it to simply circle the wagons and dismiss its actions with a sentence or two of regret responsibility must be taken and policies changed
6159861 the welfare of immigration detainees is often ignored because unlike other prisoners they do not have the right to free counsel

6159871 it seems like it would be even more antagonistic of us
6159872 i dont want to make a statement that just because you request public records were going to pull your funding
6159873 the image out there is that were trying to retaliate because they tried to pull a record

6159876 we havent established a firm schedule for the rest of the period because we want to match it up with the needs but we wanted to get the first flight out with a good flag in the ground

6159882 ive been approached by about 20 to 30 people this week since ive been here
6159883 people from wudinna cleve port lincoln streaky bay and ive got crew at wirrulla that will be using it
6159884 having this service is going to make it so much more easy for them to get here and back again so they can keep their farms
6159885 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6159886 they dont know me from adam they took my word for it
6159887 given that we already verified her previous name with her name in the system prior to this she was permitted to renew her license because it already had been renewed in 2001 with the married name
6159888 those agencies confirmed that a significant proportion of the site is below sea level with only the presence of an unstable dune barrier which is quite narrow in places protecting the land from ocean flooding
6159889 it would appear to me not to be prudent nor in the interests of proper and orderly planning to implement a policy that actively countenances the placement of dwellings on land susceptible to such a risk of flooding
6159890 were not overly happy with the fact we havent been able to have any input in this at all and we believe the information theyre using is flawed

6159967 but the group is viewed increasingly as outsiders coming in to attack algeria theres no evidence they have more support among the population this is still a localized thing
6159968 the increase in violence more or less coincides with the decision of the gspc to take on an international affiliation and become al qaeda in the islamic maghreb
