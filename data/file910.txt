9100108 it seems that the government is now waging a dirty fight since it is decapitating the workers movement and huanuni which has been the vanguard of trade union struggles for this reason we must not play the governments game
9100109 i empathise with the comrades who are shocked by the deaths in caihausi this was the governments fault but we cannot turn in on ourselves and our leaders since this is exactly what the government wants to divide the workers movement and to rule over it
9100110 these positions in huanuni will be filled so that this great union is not undermined and so that there is no crisis in the unions and the people in the leadership of the sindicato de los mineros de huanuni will be able to lead the workers struggle in the interests of the workers movement

9100136 the militants might ask anyone on the street about his identity
9100137 they take him to their stronghold for questioning when they find he is their sect they release him if not they kill him
9100138 militants attacked me in the market they forced me into the boot of a car after reaching their place they got me out of the boot tied my hands and covered my eyes they poisoned me with something that made me sick along with several other people in a room
9100139 they were shouting and insulting us they whipped me with a cable and a nylon tube on my back and legs after a few hours they took me to another room there i met the leader they called him the prince he asked me about my sect tribe job relatives etc the prince decided to release me after three days

9100203 pensemos que en un mail o en un mensaje de texto uno puede pensar cada palabra que va a escribir y hasta usar un corrector para que parezca que no cometemos faltas de ortograf a el encuentro real no permite tantas chances de fantasear si detr s de la pantalla uno crea una imagen ilusoria propia y del otro es natural que apenas se cruza al mundo real aparezca la desilusi n

9100243 the ambitious soul sits down before each refractory fact one after another reduces all strange constitutions all new powers to their class and their law and goes on for ever to animate the last fibre of organization the outskirts of nature by insight
9100244 and what is that root is not that the soul of his soul a thought too bold a dream too wild he shall see that nature is the opposite of the soul answering to it part for part one is seal and one is print its beauty is the beauty of his own mind its laws are the laws of his own mind nature then becomes to him the measure of his attainments

9100783 officials at the department of health said the figures showed the nhs was in a strong position and key targets on cutting waiting times hospital infections and improving access to gps were all on course but the figures come at a time of controversy over a series of decisions by the governments drugs watchdog the national institute for health and clinical excellence to deny a range of treatments available in many other european countries from patients on cost grounds patients protested outside the nice headquarters for access to kidney cancer drugs which although they extend life by a matter of months have not been judged a cost effective use of nhs money
9100784 hell with what they say i write these words for me not you
9100785 i know for certain p and p cabinets influential planning and priorities committee was told last week
9100786 they had a political discussion and during that political discussion they concluded that all things being equal they would like to go before the eighth
9100787 obviously at that point there were some outstanding issues how to respond to the opposition leaders but it was agreed that they would go before the eighth if at all possible and this fall for sure
9100788 all those factors outweighed the grief they were going to take for breaking their own legislation
9100789 if you let the by elections take place and you do super well in the by elections then it looks like you are an opportunist if you dont do so well as people expect in the by elections you look like the momentum has gone
9100790 and if youre determined to go it looks like this is what you do
9100791 its trademark harper in that hes making an unexpected decision and once he makes it hes going to pursue it full steam ahead and take the gamble
9100792 this is what he lives for this sort of high stakes politics this is what galvanizes him really gets him excited this is when hes at his best
9100793 youd rather have control of events yourself rather than waiting for other people to act
9100794 this allows harper to control the timing rather than sit passively and wait for dion to make up his mind
9100795 harper cares about senate reform and senate reform is the one issue where this parliament hasnt made any progress on the governments agenda
9100796 he always told me that he wanted to keep governing and he thought he gained by governing demonstrating being able to govern and i think he was sincere in that for a couple of years
9100797 but parliament has become such a circus that just being part of it isnt really helping him much any more its so degrading all the stuff that is happening i dont think it bolsters him any longer i think the situation has changed
9100798 that created the consensus certainly within the pmo where it suddenly dawned on us okay were going to go in the fall
9100799 when it was clear that we were not going to survive until october 2009 if the opposition had their way then it was just a matter of who should control the timing should it be us or should it be them

9100804 its good to see that they are actually taking the zero tolerance stance very seriously
9100805 we want to see those enhanced but for those to be effective we have to stop the flow of drugs into the institution
9100806 were going to have a drug problem in prisons for as long as we persist in pursuing an unworkable drug control strategy outside prisons
9100807 its a fallacy to think that we can successfully make prisons drug free when 100 years of drug prohibition has not made canadian society drug free

9100829 when i named eternal sunshine everybody said nobody would ever remember it
9100830 but whats cool is that the title is really easy to remember now everybody who knows that movie knows the title and if this movie gets the proper amount of response then people will be able to pronounce it and everyone will be able to know the word synecdoche which is a good word to know
9100831 one of the things i think is really exciting and joyful about the experience of being an audience member is figuring things out
9100832 when you make a connection its yours and theres a thrill to that
9100833 it has a lot of serious emotional stuff in it but its funny in a weird way you dont have to worry what does the burning house mean who cares its a burning house that someone lives funny you can get more than that if you want to hopefully the movie will work on a lot of levels and people can read different things from it depending on who they are
9100834 im interested in dreams and how we tell stories to ourselves in dreams
9100835 let me make it very clear that this film is not a dream but it does have a dreamlike logic you can start to fly in a dream and in the dream its just oh yeah i can fly its not like what your reaction would be in the real world so everything that happens in this movie is to be taken at face value its whats happening its okay that it doesnt happen in real a movie
9100836 charlie has these absurd and hilarious ideas but they are always serving something emotional
9100837 hes always using his intellect to serve something that hes feeling or that means something to him
9100838 towards the beginning i was talking to charlie about some anxiety dreams i was having
9100839 and charlie said that it would be amazing to be able to make a movie that captured those kinds of feelings
9100840 my process is to start by thinking about something and see what comes
9100841 im not very interested in things like writing towards an end
9100842 charlie would call and say i want to put this idea in the film and that idea in the film
9100843 and suddenly there were dozens and dozens of ideas charlie has a real desire to put everything hes thinking and feeling into the thing hes working on at the time
9100844 it seemed not only natural but inevitable that charlie was going to direct at some point
9100845 he thinks his life will end and he has all this heartbreak and death and separation around him and he wants to leave something true and honest and heartbreaking and just like life is
9100846 he has a difficult time being present in any situation
9100847 he misses opportunities he misses moments and he misses connections and i think thats a very common human condition
9100848 if claire is playing herself in the warehouse living in this fake claire apartment
9100849 then where she would go from there is to a rehearsal in the warehouse within the warehouse in which shed be playing herself with another sammy playing caden even though shes already at rehearsal then she would be playing herself at another rehearsal and that goes on in smaller and smaller warehouses
9100850 there are scene numbers that take place in the real warehouse
9100851 and then theres an exterior warehouse set that they built inside the warehouse and then the scenes that take place on the street set thats inside the warehouse set but outside the warehouse set number two it goes on like that
9100852 there was always an underlying structure that was not arbitrary
9100853 as confusing as it could be there was security for all of us in knowing that we could always turn to charlie or mary to clarify
9100854 all of those things were discussed with and co created by the actors
9100855 you just kind of step into the reality and before you know it you really kind of understand and you dont even know what you understand but if charlies not questioning it and its working for him then it works for you
9100856 everything you see happen to the character is something phil was going through when we shot it because thats the way he works
9100857 he had to understand what it was that was happening at every point or he couldnt do it he was very serious because this character is really struggling and phil was really struggling through the performance
9100858 it was a very hard part for phil some movies it might be intense emotionally a week or two but this film it was intense emotionally for him every day
9100859 i take big risks in my writing and i choose to do that because thats what i think makes stuff interesting the worst thing that can happen is that ill be embarrassed and they wont hire me to direct movies again if thats the worst thing that can happen thats not so bad
9100860 to me charlie might as well have been directing all of his life there was never any time where i felt he didnt understand what it meant to converse with the actor or the director of photographer or anyone in a way that clarified a situation or helped or aided in some way he always fought for what he thought was the thing that needed to happen that he always had empathy for the struggles that everyone was going through
9100861 one scene i was surprised by in dailies was something i hadnt read the scene of the pastors sermon at the end its a page long monologue about life and death an amazing piece of writing and charlie wrote it the night before
9100862 charlie faxed him this huge piece of text and the guy learned it that night and came in and did an amazing job
9100863 i want the film to be different the next time you see it and not a repeat
9100864 every time you see a play its alive the interactions between the actors is going to be different and the energy of the audience changes the actors performances
9100865 it could read as an epic story of a man who builds everything and finds himself alone
9100866 but it could also be read as a man turned in on himself in his subconscious
9100867 i want the things i do to be things that id want to see and if i went into this movie it would be cool for me
9100868 some people might tag this as an art house movie but i think more mainstream filmgoers will respond to this film i think its accessible in a way thats incredibly innovative i cant imagine its not going to speak to everybody
9100869 she called me up and said she was halfway through it and she felt she didnt know what was going on and i said that she should just finish it about an hour and a half later she called me back and said well i finished the script im still confused but when i closed it i wept for forty minutes
9100870 it requires a lot and i got in a trancelike state just reading it
9100871 there was so much thats complicated and bizarre and yet at the same time very personal and towards the end of the script i felt like it was talking about events in my own life
9100872 the counterfeiters is the true story of the largest counterfeiting operation in history set up by the nazis in 1936

9100936 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and by the way john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9100937 it seems to me to be measurable progress from the experience we had in 2004

9100943 we need to have americas help to win this fight your enemy is our enemy
9100944 in the 18 months since president bush announced the surge
9100945 our troops have performed heroically in bringing down the level of violence new tactics have protected the iraqi population and the sunni tribes have rejected al qaeda greatly weakening its effectiveness
9100946 we face opponents who have become masters at gaming this broken system
9100947 the man i saw yesterday was not the man i knew for 20 years
9100948 i say it is a lesson learned about what the american peoples priorities are and their priority is to secure the borders
9100949 we cannot allow this greatest transfer of wealth in history and our national security to continue to be threatened
9100950 i was wrong i was wrong we all make mistakes we all make mistakes
9100951 i take the train home to wilmington delaware sometimes very late as i sit there in my seat and i look out that window i see those flickering lights of the homes that pass by i can almost hear the conversation theyre having at their kitchen tables after they put their kids to bed
9100952 chose to go to chicago the south side of chicago
9100953 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama has been proven right
9100954 cry out for american ideas and american innovation and when barack obama unleashes them america will save lives win new allies open new markets and create wonderful new jobs for our own people
9100955 ill tell you i think that the possibility of this ever happening is so far out there that its tough to get my arms around and even contemplate
9100956 i would like to see a governor on that ticket i do think a governor understands being on the front lines there serving the constituents how to administer i think thats very important for a team that would be serving in the white house
9100957 i think he needs a running mate who sees the light regarding resource development and how domestic resource development can help secure the united states im very encouraged by mccains candidacy though because he so understands our national security issues much more so obviously than the democrats who are running so theres encouragement there and theres hope there i dont think theres any hope for hillary or barack to ever want to explore this idea of allowing federal lands that happen to be in the 49th state to be opened up for development
9100958 alaskans want to open up the lands for that development for the contributions that are potential here for the rest of the us
9100959 and i have to ask lawmakers in washington dc who have prohibited this drilling in anwr if theyre doing all they can to secure the united states when you consider too the geology that were talking about here and the physical space thats even needed to drill now about a 2 000 acre plot because of directional drilling and new technology allowing such a small footprint to even be placed upon the tundra up north its about 2 000 acres which is smaller than the size of lax and other big city airports that we would need to drill and allow these resources to finally be tapped and to flow into hungry markets and make us more secure i think its so short sighted
9100960 in a prime position to contribute more to the united states and to quit relying on the federal government to pay our bills for us
9100961 its going to take a change of character and a change of personality even in terms of the representation that we have in washington d c coming from alaska sean parnell is i think a perfect person to manifest that change that is coming that is needed on behalf of alaska he wants to serve for the right reasons hes very selfless and hes very much a person taking public service literally
9100962 im going to withhold judgment there i dont see a candidate whos jumped into his race yet who i would feel wholeheartedly in support of at this point so theres still weeks a couple months even to go before we make the decision on sen stevens
9100963 obama felt no need to use his vp pick to rally the base and unite his party biden was picked precisely because obama felt he was the best pick for the ticket not because he needed to mollify one group or another
9100964 a s for that v p talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the v p does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that v p slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9100965 suggests that mccain has such a low opinion of women voters that they would overlook education abortion foreign policy civil rights health care family leave and more simply to vote for a candidate with two x chromosomes
9100966 if you want to hide something from me stick it in a party platform i havent the foggiest idea whats in that thing
9100967 i think obamas perception of the military and what he would do to change it is a disaster
9100968 weve had experiences with jimmy carter and bill clinton in slashing defense
9100969 remember clintons peace dividend were paying a big price for that peace dividend i think obama shows an incredible naivety about what national security and defense is about or an intent to weaken this country im not sure which
9100970 where is the real threat from al qaeda that could attack us and our allies around the world
9100971 obviously it is in afghanistan and the pakistan border you are not going to be able to get afghanistan under control unless you put more american troops in there and you cant put more american troops in there while you are still heavily involved in iraq
9100972 democrats have a good record on defense but they have not been able to articulate it they get blamed for a lot of things that are not their fault
9100973 a strong military is more than anything necessary to sustain peace
9100974 we believe we must also be willing to consider using military force in circumstances beyond self defense
9100975 by dropping the ban on gays you would not have to lower you standards as much and get more qualified people
9100976 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay
9100977 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington but when you get to know her youre gonna be as impressed as i am

9100998 per larmonia tra le religioni e la pace in india
9100999 le violenze di questi giorni contro le comunit cristiane non possono essere passate sotto silenzio
9101000 e in gioco in questo grande paese e in tutto il mondo la libert di vivere e manifestare la propria fede religiosa contro ogni fondamentalismo gli omicidi le distruzioni di chiese e le razzie in conventi e abitazioni che hanno spinto decine di migliaia di persone ad abbandonare i propri villaggi ci mettono di fronte ad una violenza cieca che pu essere arrestata solo da un intervento forte del governo indiano fino ad oggi assente che deve essere richiesto con forza da tutta la comunit internazionale infine la comunit cristiana ovunque sia presente deve sentirsi chiamata a condividere le sofferenze dei propri fratelli perseguitati
9101001 chiedono quindi ai propri associati e a tutti i cittadini che condividono i valori della pace e della libert di unirsi al digiuno promosso dalla conferenza episcopale indiana per la giornata di domenica 7 settembre un gesto di forte valenza sociale perch attraverso la propria personale testimonianza si chiede un cambiamento della realt un atto di giustizia ed al contempo si esprime la vicinanza e condivisione con le vittime della violenza come cittadini e come cristiani non possiamo rimanere spettatori del male il digiuno e la preghiera sono per noi atti concreti politici e spirituali per dare testimonianza anche in questo momento buio per la chiesa indiana della nostra speranza
9101002 voi siete una delle dimostrazioni possibili che si pu essere moderni e cristiani insieme da irriducibili protagonisti un dato di fatto che esige il riconoscimento di tutti perch il meeting qualcosa che lascia ogni volta il segno nel cuore di chi vi partecipa e ogni anno un segno diverso
9101003 my role is a little bit different now but im excited to be here and to be able to help out
9101004 the biggest goal is just to try to stay sharp
9101005 obviously you want to play every day but if it means us winning then its something i can deal with
9101006 this year we have a few guys that are used to starting every day
9101007 somebody is not going to start on a particular day its just something theyre going to have to deal with
9101008 well move it around based on what we feel is the best lineup on the particular day do the matchups with lefty righty or whatever we can move some guys around and thats just the way its going to be we have 29 games left and were going to try to run the best lineup out there each and every day we can
9101009 one day was good the next day it felt like i needed surgery again
9101010 whatever i can do to help the dodgers win this is where they put me its not like i cant start again
9101011 i listened in on the conference calls i think its going to be a good thing and a bad thing i think its going to be a good thing because its going to get some calls right that are going to change games but at the same time it gives the umpires something to gripe about and it kind of puts a chip on their shoulders as far as we dont think theyre doing as good a job as they can
9101012 ive seen umpires run out and i know that they sincerely believe what theyre seeing and theyve been wrong so i dont see anything wrong with the replay for that
9101013 with all the nuances in these new parks its extremely difficult to discern between a home run or a ball that hits the top of the fence or that fans interfere with
9101014 fans are much more on top of the field than theyve ever been its an extremely difficult thing to ask umpires 150 feet away to be able to discern that
9101015 we just thought that if we had a chance to move it forward wed take advantage of it
9101016 they both epitomize the professionalism that we pride ourselves on and also are very talented guys their presence on the club speaks for itself
9101017 he came into the club this season basically as the last man on the roster
9101018 on the last day of spring training in the clubhouse we were talking about trying to get an advanced consent to go to the minors if the time came during the season and here we are five months later announcing an extension on his contract
9101019 what he does remains to be seen thats up to him to continue to put his best foot forward theres no promises other than he gets paid on the first and fifteenth next year
9101020 we knew going in the character the work ethic and professionalism that hes shown throughout his entire career
9101021 with some of the struggles weve had with some of the other outfielders with michael bourn struggling in the early stages of his career and carlos lee going down i dont know where we would be without darin from the standpoint of his playing ablility from the standpoint of his clubhouse presence he fits perfectly with the blueprint that we tried to put together for quality guys in the club

9101041 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9101042 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9101043 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9101044 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9101045 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9101046 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9101047 we are pleased mr schultz sees that it is neither in his nor seattles best interest to continue this litigation
9101048 the team has left for its new home in oklahoma city and its time to move on
9101049 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9101050 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9101051 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9101052 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9101053 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9101054 our past history shows that we can do it but winning here last year just kind of cemented those confident thoughts in place and we rolled it from here into richmond and won again on a track thats been very challenging to us over the years that really just put us in the right mind set that hey you can do this
9101055 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9101056 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9101057 its been kind of my goal the last moth or so to get off to better starts in tournaments
9101058 it seems like ive been having to come from behind ive just put it in my to try to get off to a better start obviously this was way exceeding my expectations

9101123 the future of a community a people a church and a nation depends on the children who will inherit it if we prevent our children from being born we remove ourselves from the future its really that simple no children no future
9101124 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state but their idea of separation often seems to work one way in fact some officials also seem comfortable in the role of theologian and that warrants some interest not as a political issue but as a matter of accuracy and justice
9101125 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation
9101126 or to put it in the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life
9101127 others that it was tantamount to homicide none diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide
9101128 from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong of course we now know with biological certainly exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to chose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
9101129 abortion kills an unborn developing human life it is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches
9101130 continued tax dollars to planned parenthood and support of gay marriage are diametrically opposed to everything african americans truly believe and an anathema to the dream of dr martin luther king jr
9101131 i urge you dont put your race before your principles before the truth before your family and before your own country previous about this blog lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams and presumption is as iniquity and idolatry because you have rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected you
9101132 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
9101133 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
9101134 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
9101135 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
9101136 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
9101137 out of unity comes security i dont think you can impose security from on top just look at yugoslavia for years it seemed as if everything was quiescent so i think we want to put unity first out of real unity which can only be based on understanding and mutual respect will come the kind of security that we really want and the people really want

9101142 under the timeline that we have right now i believe iraq is going to be 2005 afghanistan i think youre going to have 3 years of moderate success and then all the sudden something happens in iran something happens across the way and now youre going to see how fragile this piece is

9101144 theres no curfew people walk in the streets on strolls
9101145 when we would go out on patrol we would get sniped at a lot there were a lot of ieds improvised explosive device there were a lot of car bombs
9101146 when i was there today not a shot was fired at us
9101147 they were talking about i want water and i want power for my business and i want my sidewalk fixed because it got blown up by an ied
9101148 i think the biggest improvement that were seeing is were no longer talking about what targets we have to blow up about what insurgents we need to catch were talking about how do we create power for a local neighborhood that wants to start up a neighborhood market
9101149 when i was there we had something called icdc iraqi civil defense corps i went on patrol with those men you know what they did they blew their ak 47 rounds straight up in the air till they were out of their clip and then they ran away
9101150 these young guys now the first sergeants and the caoptains who are taking these guys out on patrol say that that no longer happens
9101151 i would ask people on patrol when i was there as a soldier what are you what tribe
9101152 the sunni is not the enemy in iraq today the kurd is no longer the enemy of iraq
9101153 the enemy in iraq is the foreign jihadist and america is a tribe were the biggest tribe were the strongest tribe that is the metaphor that we need to start talking in

9101157 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
9101158 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position in fact they are passive but real allies of the haves the most unethical of all means is the non use of any means the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived the world as it is not our wished for fantasy of the world as it should be
9101159 radicals are most adept at breaking the necks of conservatives
9101160 in a fight almost anything goes it almost reaches the point where you stop to apologize if a chance blow lands above the belt
9101161 the most unethical of all means is the non use of any means
9101162 lest we forget at least an over the shoulder acknowledgment to the very first radical from all our legends mythology and history and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins or which is which the first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom lucifer

9101165 today senator barack obama with the most liberal voting record in the u s senate is delivering his political acceptance speech in an apparent attempt to assume for himself the mantle of dr martin luther king dr king did not embrace the type of secularist agenda promoted by obama and the democratic party of today which includes fostering dependency on welfare that breaks up families supporting same sex marriage and partial birth abortion and banning god from the public square
9101166 we shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of earth
9101167 out of unity comes security i dont think you can impose security from on top just look at yugoslavia for years it seemed as if everything was quiescent so i think we want to put unity first out of real unity which can only be based on understanding and mutual respect will come the kind of security that we really want and the people really want

9101324 heading into qualifying we hadnt driven in the dry at all because it rained during both of the practice sessions today last year i didnt have much track time here so i was a bit of a newbie going into qualifying in dry conditions even though it was so wet this morning and we didnt run even one lap on slick non rain tires somehow the crew found a good setup for the dry and we were pretty much where we wanted to be in the beginning of the session it took a while to get the tire pressures up the crew called me into the pits but i knew that i hadnt pushed as hard as i could and that i could go quicker i was able to go out one last time there were four minutes left and i pushed hard after one lap i thought i had it but then the no 71 and then the no 62 both beat that time then on the final lap i pushed again and was able to take the pole
9101325 qualifying was exciting i think we had enough to get pole but with the changing conditions from the practice sessions we had a little bit too much at the rear the rear tires came in before the fronts and hence we had a little too much understeer that is fixable for tomorrow
9101326 we never could make a qualifying setup for the dry every time we went out we were fastest in the rain when it was dry other teams could go back to their setups from last year but the ferrari for us is a new car so we didnt know really what we had for the dry we gambled and i think we had a pretty good setup third place is very good the race is long tomorrow and it is important to stay out of trouble as we have seen at long beach and st petersburg is very important to stay out of trouble if you brake late you are in the wall and if you dont look in your mirrors you have contact with the prototypes for sure this is the hardest one to stay out of trouble we have to stick to our position and we cant get a gap between and the flying lizards
9101327 we got everything right on the second practice we had been quickest in both the sessions in qualifying there was one corner still wet where you are under braking there is some time that could be gained there if you risked a lot but it was our first try on the slick and not worth the risk position three is ok i think the combination is able to do pole but it was difficult for everybody congratulations to wolf henzler he obviously got a good lap it was close traffic is going to be the issue in the race we have saw it last year lots of incidents lots of contact hopefully last weekends work will pay off this weekend
9101328 it was a pretty messed up first day with the weather especially with the program jim and i had it just didnt work out like we had planned it now at the end of the day i think i have eight laps at detroit thats the only way it was going to work out the weather bit us a little bit jim did a great job not having any laps in the dry he got much faster every lap ill just have to go out there and find my way around for the start of my stint no big deal it is a long race
9101329 my confidence is really good i couldnt get the car to turn and it started to push that was where i left all my time alex and i will go and try and run a solid race and look for a good finish with the 73 ferrari
9101330 for me personally its the first time in a long time that ive had a package like this with the sort of people we are working with that inspires you to dig deeper and go around quicker scott is doing a fantastic job every time he gets in the car the whole chemistry is working well together
9101331 our dyson racing crew led by stefan dwornik and peter weston set the car up perfectly despite the limited amount of track time earlier in the day because of the rain and the car felt well balanced during the qualifying session i thought we even had the potential for a better lap but traffic prevented a really clean try
9101332 the bernhard dumas car had the right set up but electrical problems prevent timo from using full power during qualifying so he only turned a handful of laps with limited revs and shifting ability
9101333 because of the limited amount of dry track time earlier in the day we decided to use the qualifying to test our race set up and the long briscoe car had the wrong set up for patricks qualifying effort while the other car had the right set up it was hampered by the electrical problems in all we have all the information we need for our race set up but it was not soon enough for good qualifying
9101334 with no run off area you must drive perfectly on a street course to keep the car off the wall and i am at my best under those conditions
9101335 we were really at a disadvantage after rain this morning as we didnt have time to secure a good set up but the lizard crew guessed right and i was pretty fast from the beginning of qualifying i knew i could go faster and the crew brought me in for a tire pressure adjustment and that made the different with joerg and me trying to expand our lead in the gt2 drivers championship it is a big advantage to start on the pole

9101343 grande a expectativa quanto ao pronunciamento do supremo tribunal federal sobre a demarca o de terras da reserva raposa serra do sol em roraima entre os pr prios ministros a expectativa igual porque n o se imagina como vir o voto do relator o ministro carlos ayres brito diante disso a aposta feita nos corredores a de que um deles pe a vista para que se possa analisar o assunto a partir do voto do relator
9101344 achei que o ministro foi desrespeitoso e deselegante com os produtores ele alterou a hist ria de roraima a favor de sua id ia

9101359 the worlds getting smaller boundaries are blurring and cultural values beliefs and practices are following suit
9101360 this practice of making certain units off limits to tenants because of their national origin clearly violates californias fair employment and housing act
9101361 the department found compelling evidence that the landlord rented only less desirable apartments to tenants of indian national origin
9101362 the remington grove apartments always maintain fair and non discriminatory housing practices and treat everyone the same
9101363 anything to the contrary has never been proven in court and we admit no wrongdoing
9101364 because of the convention this week they asked me if i would be willing to be a political whip and i said id be happy to
9101365 it s certainly not the best way to do your first dry laps on a new city street circuit in qualifying but our car was also not so good we have a lot to do before the race the track is just very bumpy
9101366 this was a day to forget with very difficult conditions we had no time to work out a reasonable setup it will be a tough race for us but we will try to find something in the warm up then let s see what happens in the race
9101367 if you have to pick the worst conditions for our r10 tdi you can t chose a better day than this one we like straights smooth tracks and a lot of grip here we have tight corners lots of bumps and no grip at all because it s been raining a lot on this kind of tracks we need to quite a lot of set up work to optimize the car this was not the case because of the rain we did what we could in qualifying tomorrow is another day we showed many times that race day is really a different day for the audis we can only benefit from the track getting more rubber
9101368 it was a very difficult day there was no time to make a proper set up and no time to get the drivers accustomed i think there is still a lot more in the car

9101407 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
9101408 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
9101409 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
9101410 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
9101411 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
9101412 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
9101413 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
9101414 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
9101415 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
9101416 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
9101417 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
9101418 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

9101440 there are growing numbers of asian indian elderly individuals who current need and will increasingly need as they age a variety of social and healthcare services and supports in order to remain independent they often do not receive these services for a variety of reasons including limited english language skills stigma in receiving services lack of awareness of available services lack of transportation lack of culturally and linguistically competent staffing at existing service providers

9101442 there continues to be high rates of domestic violence within the asian indian community which is often denied minimized or rationalized by community leaders
9101443 asian indians experience several significant medical problems diabetes heart related illness at rates that are far higher than experienced by other groups this issue is impacting a growing number of families yet needed prevention education and screening is very much underutilized a growing body of medical research indicates that some of these health related problems have both a genetic as well as behavioral causative and contributory factors
9101444 leaders in the indian community must take the lead in promoting prevention and quality care and must put these issues as high for their community
9101445 healthcare and social service professionals need to do more research and develop some specialized and culturally appropriate approaches and interventions

9101472 this practice shows a complete lack of respect for some dedicated women who have been working in the schools for many years this is appalling
9101473 school district 2 in the moncton area just laid off 37 teacher assistants contrary to the schools in the northern part of the province where families are moving because of the economic situation this region has seen an increase in school enrolment there is no justification for such a large number of teacher assistants receiving their pink slip in school district 2 this represents 12 of the ta in that school district
9101474 across the district close to 115 teacher assistants will be affected simply because of the bumping process that will take place
9101475 this type of practice is not what inclusive education is all about it creates disruption in many classrooms and there is no stability and consistency for children that badly need it
9101476 it is also unacceptable that some women are losing their job because they have been unable to take the additional training required to work with autistic children called
9101477 the school district should rescind these layoffs and stop these ridiculous processes that disturb the livelihood of mostly low wage women
9101478 if the government is asking the government to have this certification in order to work with autistic kids then it should make sure that the training is available for them

9101535 the hourly rates of the countrys top lawyers are increasingly coming with something new a comma a few attorneys crossed into 1 000 per hour billing before this year but recent moves to the four figure mark in new york which sets trends for legal markets around the country are seen as a significant turning point on sept 1 new yorks simpson thacher amp bartlett llp will raise its top rate to more than 1 000 from 950 firm partner barry ostrager a litigator says he will be one of the firms thousand dollar billers along with private equity specialist richard beattie and antitrust lawyer kevin arquit the top biller at new yorks cadwalader wickersham amp taft llp hit 1 000 per hour earlier this year at fried frank harris shriver amp jacobson llp also of new york bankruptcy attorney brad scheler now at 995 per hour will likely soon charge 1 000
9101536 lawyers who bill by the hour typically spend their time thinking about hours rather than results few hourly billing attorneys tell their client what they will be delivering and the costs upfront once deliverables are defined a value billing attorney simply asks himself herself the same question each moment of each day how do i deliver the deliverables i have promised the client instead of cases just meandering forward each day the lawyers required to think strategically the lawyer has tremendous incentive to achieve that result sooner rather than later this is because hours of time now count against him her in contrast to the hourly billing approach where hours count against the client
9101537 many firms are actively thinning the ranks of equity partners
9101538 partners have given away almost all their rights running the firm is delegated to a committee which runs the firm like a business underperforming partners are given a warning and then shown the door
9101539 the eeoc has been watching this the agencys position often is that so called partners have ceded so many rights that they are really employees they are no longer partners the way they actually work on the ground
9101540 with overhead an associate costs a law firm double her salary thus an associate must bill 1 500 hours simply to pay for herself because not every hour can be billed that is about 1 800 hours of work six hours a day six days a week the rest of the day is the unpaid labor generating the surplus value value that the partners appropriate

9101543 the decline of tenured faculty and the tenure system may not be such a bad thing there will be more mobility if tenure somehow went away thered be a lot of openings 20 25 percent might be forced out this would drive up wages it might be good for both individual institutions and for competent faculty
9101544 bad for the industry the benefits of tenure include shared governance without tenure all power would be transferred to the administration which is primarily interested in the short term while the tenured faculty tend to take the long view higher education would wind up with the same problems that plague corporations which quest only for short term profits
9101545 the broadest trend i see is how philanthropy is administered its all about accountability administrators turn to the for profit playbook an institutions biggest cost is people lots of institutions are aggressively paring down their people costs by cutting tenured faculty to the bare minimum the problem for administrators is that theres no comparable private sector playbook for managing tenured faculty tenure protects dead wood thats the terrible side of it administrators have to turn to the soft side in order to try to make these folks more productive

9101548 as an arab american woman i am of course aware that the title of my book is an ethnic slur indeed i selected the title to highlight one of the novels major themes racism in the tradition of dick gregorys autobiography nigger the jewish magazine heeb or the feminist magazine bitch the title is rude and shocking but it is not gratuitous besides the fact that the main character must endure taunting about her ethnicity including being called a towelhead so much of the novels plot is fueled by the characters attitudes toward race
9101549 as a gay man i know how it feels to be called hateful names simply because of who i am therefore i felt it was important to retain the title of alicia erians novel in which she so effectively dramatizes the pain inflicted by such language something many people of non minority descent never have to face i believe one of the unintended consequences of forbidding such words to be spoken is imbuing those words with more power than they should ever have and helping create the illusion that the bigotry and racism expressed by such cruel epithets is less prevalent than it actually is which we all know is sadly not the case

9101595 the debts of governments federal state and local corporations farmers home mortgages and consumer commercial and financial debts
9101596 the consistency of the pattern suggests that some imperative is at work something that requires debt to increase
9101597 then i read g r taylors 1950 book hamilton and the national debt which described the debate over alexander hamiltons plan to fund the new economy with borrowed money
9101598 the most revealing account was a speech by the first congressman from georgia james jackson on february 9 1790 in which he predicted that adoption of hamiltons funding plan would lead to the explosive growth of debt
9101599 loans created only the principal interest had to be paid out of principal so payment of interest reduced the money supply and slowed economic activity recovery could come only when new loans were taken out at least equal to interest paid
9101600 as long as the money supply of a nation is created as debt costing interest debt must grow by compound interest
9101601 we are buying more and more in the same amount of time witness the efforts of people to get rid of their excess through yard sales storage units and big trash pickup days and the massive size of what are euphemistically called landfills while two billion people in the world lack basics such as clean water food and shelter americans throw away their microwave ovens televisions computers refrigerators furniture and cars meanwhile acceleration is applauded as increasing productivity its like arguing that cancer is good because it grows
9101602 stop using percentage rates to calculate charges for the use of money
9101603 congress must supply the economy with a money base that is debt free and interest free
9101604 this is a crucial time things are happening we have got some key media people talking and writing about our kind of reforms the inertia is starting to yield things are starting to roll the worsening conditions in 2009 will give us a once in a lifetime chance to be heard above the propaganda

9101608 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9101609 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9101610 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9101611 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9101612 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9101613 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9101614 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9101615 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9101616 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on

9101630 after 9 11 nobody wanted to hear anything bad about america
9101631 nobody loves a war better than the president and a few years ago it got to the point where if i said anything i truly believed about the iraq war or global warming during a concert people would get up and leave thats fine with me actually its a badge of honour
9101632 little by little it became clear that bush was bizarre and dangerous

9101638 i had this great fear of going commercial as a result of becoming well known at such a young age i was afraid of the wider world but i did also have deeply held beliefs that i clung on to tenaciously the big event was meeting martin luther king in 1956 at a quaker seminar that pretty much shaped the direction my life took
9101639 they laughed all the time and told racist jokes about themselves and i realised that nobody could see that side of them they had to be seen as serious and i related to that we got to a restaurant and i asked them dont you have a big march to organise they said we just have you get a public image that you have to live up to but your private reality is often very different

9101674 that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else

9101679 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9101680 i would like to ask the distinguished representative of the united states weapons of mass destruction have you found them yet in iraq or are you still looking for them
9101681 im not a psychologist and i dont know what brought on the free association we heard from ambassador churkin
9101682 those are well known we thought we had overcome them apparently there are still some lingering frustrations but there is no territorial ambition or desire to dismember iraq
9101683 im afraid this assertion ambassador churkin simply does not stand up to scrutiny
9101684 you mean if john mccain croaks she becomes our president
9101685 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was

9101725 for i am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord
9101726 will be able to separate us from the love of god in christ jesus our lord
9101727 but it is not as though the word of god has failed for not all who are descended from israel belong to israel and not all are children of abraham because they are his offspring but through isaac shall your offspring be named this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are children of god but the children of the promise who are counted as offspring
9101728 we are offspring of abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone
9101729 i know that you are offspring of abraham yet you seek to kill me because my word finds no place in you
9101730 i know that you are offspring of abraham if you were abrahams children
9101731 this is not what abraham did you are doing what your father obviously not abraham here did
9101732 but he was speaking about the temple of his body
9101733 for the promise to abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith
9101734 with this place as its point of origin the gospel of jesus christ could travel at the fastest possible speed to the ends of the earth this land crafted by the one who shaped the continents was designed from the beginning not as an end in itself but as a means to the end of reaching the world with the gospel
9101735 honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the lord your god is giving you
9101736 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor your father and mother this is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land
9101737 for no one is a jew who is merely one outwardly nor is circumcision outward and physical but a jew is one inwardly and circumcision is a matter of the heart by the spirit not by the letter his praise is not from man but from god
9101738 for as many of you as were baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus and if you are christs then you are abrahams offspring heirs according to promise
9101739 broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
9101740 alienated from the commonwealth of israel and strangers to the covenants of promise
9101741 been brought near by the blood of christ ephesians 2 12 13
9101742 we are the real circumcision who worship by the spirit of god and glory in christ jesus and put no confidence in the flesh
9101743 but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father is seeking such people to worship him god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
9101744 but far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ by which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world for neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation
9101745 for neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation and as for all who walk by this rule peace and mercy be upon them and upon the israel of god
9101746 for you are a people holy to the lord your god
9101747 for consider your calling brothers not many of you were wise according to worldly standards not many were powerful not many were of noble birth
9101748 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation
9101749 but you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a holy nation a people for his own possession that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light
9101750 but this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days declares the lord i will put my law within them and i will write it on their hearts
9101751 this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood
9101752 when israel was a child i loved him and out of egypt i called my son
9101753 and he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to egypt and remained there until the death of herod
9101754 and i will walk among you and will be your god and you shall be my people
9101755 since we have these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit bringing holiness to completion in the fear of god
9101756 and the lord said to moses make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole and everyone who is bitten when he sees it shall live so moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole and if a serpent bit anyone he would look at the bronze serpent and live
9101757 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may have eternal life
9101758 since the messiah was believed to arise in the wilderness and gather the people there the judean desert was repeatedly the scene where messianic movements were gathering although the various movements apparently had different political colours
9101759 the wilderness is invariably the place to which the pretenders lure their followers

9101842 a scientific case for the mariana trench marine national monument
9101843 the aim of group was to get a girl picked up from the street for their own sexual gratification
9101844 each of them knew that in all likelihood violence would be used against the women in order to subjugate them and make them compliant there was no question of any of these women consenting to what happened to them
9101845 once at this location two further males actually climbed over the rear seats they had been hiding in the back and immediately started to attack her
9101846 she was struck in the face and they began to try and rip her clothing from her with the exception of the driver who watched what unfolded the other three males raped her
9101847 the prosecutions case is once more that the driver was kora
9101848 the driver engaged her in conversation and agreed a price for each man
9101849 she said that she knew she was a working girl and that people would think that she deserved it but she went on to say no one deserves this
9101850 four of these males became aggressive in demeanour towards her she was punched they began to remove her jeans and rifle through her handbag whilst this was occurring the driver watched
9101851 the people carrier was then driven off to long lane while she was physically held down in the back of the vehicle
9101852 on arrival there the male she describes as being the most violent demanded sex again
9101853 nice beautiful and they could have done stupid things with her

9101876 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctrines of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose i dont think anybody can tell you when life begins human life begins
9101877 killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
9101878 abortion is evil its the destruction of a human life this teaching has not changed and remains unchanged
9101879 the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life

9101901 i dont think so i think its about getting in touch with reality about balancing aspirations and actuality
9101902 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
9101903 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
9101904 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
9101905 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
9101906 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
9101907 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
9101908 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
9101909 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
9101910 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
9101911 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
9101912 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
9101913 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
9101914 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
9101915 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
9101916 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
9101917 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face

9101939 in recent scholarship jesus has been imagined and presented as a type of first century shaman figure as a cynic sort of wandering wise man as a visionary radical and social reformer preaching egalitarian ethics to the destitute as a galilean regionalist alienated from the elitism of judean religious conventions like temple and torah as a champion of national liberation and on the contrary as its opponent and critic on and on

9102023 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder

9102032 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
9102033 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
9102034 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
9102035 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
9102036 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
9102037 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest

9102039 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
9102040 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life

9102053 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
9102054 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
9102055 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
9102056 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money

9102088 union spending in michigan a review of union financial disclosure reports
9102089 our review of union reports indicates that michigan unions tend to have rather bloated operations with high operating costs our research also suggests that unions in michigan are not focused on representing workers
9102090 on the whole these loopholes tend to work in the unions favor
9102091 but even with these very generous rules most unions spend less than half of their funds on worker representation
9102092 we give unions in this state tremendous power and access to financial resources
9102093 but the financial reports indicate that unions in michigan may be misusing what we have given them
9102094 our committee takes these reported allegations seriously and we plan to thoroughly review this matter

9102115 if passed the efca will represent the most dramatic change in labor relations since the passage of the wagner act in 1935 which established the national labor relations board
9102116 the act will make it extraordinarily easy for unions to organize in both the traditional sectors and many other segments of the service community
9102117 furthermore it is reasonable to assume that public peer pressure will prevail and that some employees may face subtle or even explicit intimidation since their vote will not be cast in secret
9102118 under the current system the typical union campaign lasts approximately six weeks during that time the employer has the opportunity to educate its workers on the realities of joining a union which can include dues and strikes
9102119 but under the system proposed by efca a card or petition signed in the emotion of the moment can result in a two year collective bargaining contract
9102120 the danger of a petition or card signing makes a thorough re evaluation of company policies procedures and practices worthwhile
9102121 employers can implement a number of prudent and cost effective measures that will increase worker satisfaction and prevent unionization
9102122 happy workers are far harder to organize than unhappy employees
9102123 the best approach employers can take is to make sure their workforce is genuinely satisfied the old adage that unions dont win elections companies lose them is still true
9102124 if adopted the efca will significantly undermine elections as a way to engage union representation
9102125 additionally the efca will reflect the governments clear support of the unions in first contract situations rather than providing a neutral bargaining framework for both parties

9102138 because what the court is holding is that the company was permeated with fraud and therefore everything is taken rather than a defined amount of what was fraud
9102139 steven warshak preyed on perceived sexual inadequacies of customers not only was steven warshak corrupt but he corrupted his family he was the mastermind of the debacle but for his arrogance he could have helped them all by taking responsibility but he was blinded by his arrogance and greed

9102141 under advertising law you are responsible not only for your direct message but you are also responsible for implied statements
9102142 so that advertising maybe a five year old wouldnt get it but when you and i see it it doesnt matter that theyre not talking about the girth from whats actually in the ads theres enough recognition in the public of what theyre implying so while theyre not using the exact words the message of that advertisement is very clear and that is a violation of federal trade commission law
9102143 normal process is if the agency catches wind of something that they are not happy with you will get a warning letter
9102144 most companies following the receipt of a warning letter will change their labeling sufficiently so that they are not running afoul of the fdas rules what makes this case particularly interesting is that there are lots of dietary supplement companies out on the market making claims that they shouldnt be and its very rare that something like this happens usually the worst thing that youll see is the ftc will go after you for false advertising and disgorge some of your profits
9102145 and if there was a taking of their profits sometimes if it was a small operation that takes in a couple of million depending on the facts of the case they might get that couple of million getting 500 million if thats what they made thats a really significant verdict
9102146 there have been some recent cases which require more than just that
9102147 you need to have stealth you need to have issues of camouflage for money laundering which my client didnt do you dont hide money in your own name i think there are issues on the principles of money laundering theres issues of bank fraud when no bank suffered any losses so there are major issues for appeal
9102148 proportionality is always an issue to be raised on appeal proportionality with other case and proportionality within the same case
9102149 the judge even stated on the record that no one lost their homes or life savings that was part of his remarks so the prison time and the forfeiture definitely seem out of proportion

9102208 i cant tell you how many times a friend has complained to me that their child wont eat anything healthy or their child wont eat anything but pb amp j so i started giving out suggestions and recipes things i found useful
9102209 most of the things i suggested just made sense sometimes someone would pass on a great idea to me too it is amazing how much moms will spread the word of a good idea
9102210 it isnt finding the perfect person but learning to see an imperfect person perfectly
9102211 i think in many instances there is a lack of awareness on how important it is to unions and the democratic agenda
9102212 unions have been able to fly under the radar with this but people who follow it know it would radically change the way unions can organize
9102213 i know what the law is but employers do try to scare and intimidate workers
9102214 the efca would let them get over the hump to where they want to be
9102215 other employers will get their peoples pay and benefits up just to keep us out so in that regard everyone wins
9102216 the national labor relations board does a good admirable job and their credibility is being besmirched the agency exists so employees can have a choice
9102217 i think its the most offensive part of the efca and a lot of lawyers think its unconstitutional
9102218 the so called free choice act is a completely one sided proposal it has no provision for allowing employees to rid themselves of unwanted unions through a card check
9102219 the arrest detention abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the state or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization support or acquiescence of the state followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person which place such a person outside the protection of the law
9102220 no exceptional circumstances whatsoever whether a state of war or a threat of war internal political instability or any other public emergency may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance
9102221 it is a natural trend in any market that when multinational companies withdraw for political reasons smaller companies which are less capable in economic terms but also less vulnerable in political terms get into the market more easily than before
9102222 we are cooperating fully we will not tolerate in any leader actions that threaten the best interests of our members
9102223 we take seriously any allegations of intimidation violence or retaliation intimidation of union members is unacceptable and is prohibited by law
9102224 this is the time for me to finally speak up

9102402 union bosses are working overtime and spending tens of millions of dollars to get card check passed were going to work equally hard to educate people about the threat to private ballots in union organizing elections
9102403 the ability for workers to cast their vote in private is at stake
9102404 coincidentally by the ghosts of old amusement parks whod passed away

9102433 i actually had to hold back some tears its still setting in its still surreal i feel a sense of accomplishment inside that we did something really important its not going to really set in until days later years later any time i look up there and see i have a banner for something i accomplished its going to bring chills to my body

9102436 i think that its just a principle of american democracy that you should be able to choose to be a member of a union or not be a member of a union and you should be able to make that choice without anything rigged either way
9102437 i would think that that position of senator barack obamas really comes about because of special interest pressure not because of any logical analysis of what is right in the democrat system
9102438 this idea that senator obama is somehow the new politics is really one of the bigger myths that exists he is very much the old politics he does the things unions want
9102439 dont care if they destroy the middle class and the middle class in this country was created by the right to form unions and collective bargain theres no other way
9102440 it should not be up to the boss to decide how a union is organized it should be up to the unions
9102441 nationwide the right to a secret ballot is important to everybody union members and non union members the union bosses would like to have the card check system which basically allows someone to walk in and intimidate a voter by giving them a card watching how they vote having them sign that card and give it back to the union officials
9102442 george mcgovern came out for preserving the secret ballot in union elections
9102443 recent attempt by congressional democrats to deny workers a private ballot in union referenda is an assault not only against a fundamental principle of labor law but even more against the dignity and honor of the american work force
9102444 its ironic republicans are pushing this because its bipartisan legislation so theyre writing a plank to their platform that members of their own party reject
9102445 i used to prefer fill in the name but changed to yahoo or google or live because it was better
9102446 i championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by congress in fact i told congress i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere if our state wanted a bridge i said wed build it ourselves
9102447 well he was tossing around liebermans name and tom ridge is pro choice weve seen the level of talent republicans have of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory before he could be ready to stick the thumb in the conservative eye yet again
9102448 so what changes do you intend on making to my wardrobe
9102449 i choose to do it because no one else can at least without sacrificing honor integrity and their soul
9102450 were here to prove that with enough strategy even geeks can dress well and still grab the girl in the end besides all that dorky stuff you like is cool now comic books video games anime you wear that shit on your t shirts right

9102504 investors should take heart that there are companies they can invest in at very low valuations in emerging markets and in the particular case of latin america many have u s listed adrs that have plenty of liquidity and are very accessible and cost effective to buy
9102505 in brazil one of the more interesting food companies that we like is a company called
9102506 people are just eating more meat than they have in the past pda essentially raises poultry and sells frozen goods but meat is an important component of that overall revenue mix exports last year grew close to 50 its had over 80 year to year sales growth and 40 year to year ebitda growth
9102507 we think that mexico is probably the best positioned latin american country from a risk perspective because obviously with 86 exports to the u s its very reliant on the u s but its still seeing very healthy internal growth irrespective of whats going on in the u s
9102508 theyre called oxxo convenience stores very strong sales and ebitda growth despite the presumed slowdown thats been occurring as it relates to the u s contagion effect and valued very attractively at 8 times ebitda
9102509 we fire the particles at a ridiculous speed and they smash into the atom

9102514 these paintings represent a bit of a departure for me as an artist
9102515 i am usually very controlled with my paintings and drawings doing mostly realism illustrative work and portraiture but these are more expressionistic in nature and all the paintings were completed in just one night id never done anything like them before or since i think that people will like this side of me the paintings express a lot of emotion using very few strokes of the brush

9102518 she was abducted in karachi in 2003 and had not been seen since everything we can understand about her detention in the last five and a half years leads us to believe that she was at bagram a us detention camp which is notorious for torture
9102519 as media pressure mounted here in pakistan my family received news of the alleged sudden discovery of aafia in afghanistan
9102520 after five years of detention aafia was suddenly discovered i am not that much of a believer in coincidence
9102521 we are hoping and praying that they are all safe
9102522 the real shame is that the children are innocent they havent committed any crime
9102523 the tragedies we have experienced throughout history were not the fault of religion but were caused by extremism which has been adopted by some of the followers of all religion and all political systems
9102524 our dialogue will be a success of faith against atheism of virtue against vice of justice against injustice of peace against conflicts and wars and of human brotherhood against racism
9102525 we have always been interested in strengthening peace dialogue and cooperation on the international stage
9102526 the aim of inter faith conference is for us to get to know each other and to look for ways to cooperate
9102527 i can dialogue with the jews but not with the zionists
9102528 intentional separation of jews from a land with which intrinsic bond is part of their religious self understanding
9102529 we have to understand how the other sees himself or herself
9102530 some clarifications are needed about judaism which is a religion and zionism which is a political system secondly we have to identify those who believe in peace from those who believe resort to violence from both sides muslim and jews i didnt say we wont have dialogue with zionists
9102531 you have no right to separate muslims from their land and no one has the right to separate jews from their land we need to see jerusalem through a mirror and it looks very ugly it is a shame we abrahamic faiths are not able to speak on palestinian issue and it is a shame we cannot resolve the issue of palestine
9102532 it is a great initiative by king abdullah there is a growing appetite to see peaceful co existence between people of different faiths
9102533 for us to work together so that the work would be more fraternal
9102534 the time has come for all of us as gods children to unite and to reason and dialogue together

9102536 welcoming attitude of the king of saudi arabia and the king of spain so very moved
9102537 religion gets blamed a lot more than it is responsible
9102538 i believe religion has the power to contribute to peace making it has the power to understand each other and appreciate each other respect each others dignity and worth and when that happens people talk to each other begin to know each other
9102539 it has the backing of one of the most powerful people on the planet king abdullah and i know that we owe a debt of gratitude to him i think we should all give whatever support we can because it is our responsibility to see it succeed

9102570 the identity of the zodiac killer is jack tarrance hes my stepfather
9102571 if i wrote a book and said i think my stepfather is the zodiac killer they wouldnt believe me
9102572 it could be a knife he barbecued with or a knife he murdered someone with
9102573 when i first opened it up that did affect me my heart skipped a couple of beats when i saw it
9102574 it was a black hood with a zodiac on it

9102643 vamos a seguir acumulando y acumulando marcos jur dicos que tienen toda la intenci n de prevenir atender sancionar y erradicar la violencia hacia las mujeres pero si las autoridades no tienen la voluntad pol tica para hacerlo esto va a ser muy dif cil
9102644 es un problema de derechos humanos equidad g nero y seguridad

9102646 they wont deal with the uncomfortable parts since we dont select people to be bosses based on their ability to do the work that bosses do and dont give them the tools to do it its no wonder they find things like confronting poor behavior or performance to be very uncomfortable and when things make us uncomfortable we tend to avoid them

9102655 is there an alternative to bpa based sealants that is effective and safe
9102656 any concern about potential bpa exposure from dental composites or sealants is unwarranted at this time when compared with all other sources of bpa these dental materials pose significantly lower exposure concerns
9102657 the ada is a professional association of dentists who remain committed to the publics oral health as such we strongly support additional research into human exposure to bpa and any health effects it may cause
9102658 mercury is a large component of dental fillings but it is not believed to pose immediate health risks in that form

9102660 nosotros apoyamos todo lo que tiene que ver con prevenci n no somos condonistas manejamos todo pero estos ltimos a os se fomenta la educaci n de otra forma sac ndole la vuelta a los temas importantes no creo que se est realizando correctamente por parte del estado
9102661 no se trata de casos similares a los de ciudad ju rez
9102662 no al entrar a la presidencia sino desde tres a os anterior cuando vicente ter n que es mi esposo era presidente municipal
9102663 hemos visto que agua prieta tiene el m s alto ndice de crecimiento demogr fico en el pa s eso nos indica que se quedan a radicar eso nos obliga a trabajar por infraestructura a trabajar por los servicios m s elementales y es por eso que hab a tanto rezago en pavimentaci n hospitales embellecimiento estoy contenta porque ya el se or gobernador nos dio el apoyo y pronto empezaremos a construir un hospital general aqu en agua prieta
9102664 por medio de nuestra polic a preventiva por medio del grupo beta por medio del c nsul mexicano en douglas por medio de nuestra polic a fronteriza al otro lado de la frontera que tambi n tenemos una comunicaci n y ellos nos est n pasando reportes mensuales qu es lo que ellos ven por all y nosotros cruzamos la informaci n con lo que nosotros tenemos por ac de hecho tambi n nos dan la informaci n mensual del n mero de expulsados que ellos regresan a m xico
9102665 yo te pudiera decir de una de las jovencitas supuestamente fue asesinada por su c nyuge entonces quiz por eso no haya esa relaci n por eso el procurador lo vea as muchas veces las causas son la desintegraci n familiar la drogadicci n muchas veces como viene gente buena viene gente mala no todas las personas que vienen vienen nada m s a trabajar otros cuando se ven en apuros toman otras determinaciones y por eso tenemos que reforzar esa seguridad p blica ahora si vemos a la otra muchachita que fue asesinada sta tambi n tra a otro tipo de problemas
9102666 yo siento igual que sea en este tipo de muchachas que hasta cierto punto est n un poco desprotegidas a veces por sus padres a veces por la sociedad o por la vida misma eso me da igual de pavor creo que tenemos que atacar de ra z
9102667 l me mantiene l me tiene esta casa l me est protegiendo
9102668 yo pienso que a todo ser humano nos da terror pensar a d nde vamos a llegar qu vamos a hacer yo pienso que se han perdido muchos valores yo pienso que la seguridad p blica tiene mucho qu ver pero tiene m s que ver los valores que uno traiga como persona para no exponerte ante situaciones m s peligrosas todos esos malvivientes son parte de desintegraciones familiares drogadictos que se les hace f cil cometer un asesinato s me da mucho miedo eso por eso primero nos estamos avocando a esos valores que se est n perdiendo esa comunicaci n entre padres e hijos hacerles entender que tu como persona puedes tener menos problemas si eres educado si no usas drogas tienes un porcentaje asegurado de que probablemente no te ocurra situaciones como stas te puede ocurrir porque te encuentres con un desquiciado pero no te est s poniendo en la boca del lobo
9102669 no porque hemos tenido qu reforzar nosotros como polic a preventiva s necesitamos m s polic as pero es m s importante trabajar de una manera conjunta tenemos alrededor de 110 polic as los judiciales no s exactamente cu ntos son pero los estamos reforzando con polic as preventivos cuando se trata de alg n operativo creo que hay buena coordinaci n tenemos reuniones constantes as que tenemos esa colaboraci n
9102670 todav a a principios de los a os sesentas agua prieta era una ciudad peque a aunque lleg bamos hasta la avenida 20 y nosotros estamos en la 17 hab a muchos terrenos bald os se desarroll econ micamente primero como pueblo ganadero aunque el motivo de su fundaci n fue que se empez a construir la v a del ferrocarril douglas agua prieta nacozari para transportar el mineral de nacozari y llevarlo a la fundici n de douglas es entonces cuando empieza a llegar gente de bavispe bacerac fronteras de todas partes a asentarse aqu para encontrar trabajo
9102671 la gente que se dedicaba a la ganader a hizo comercio hacia estados unidos y como es muy f cil la pasada por aqu de eso viv an hubo un tiempo en que a agua prieta se le conoci como una isla rodeada de tierra porque no hab a v as de comunicaci n la gente que se quer a trasladar r pido utilizaba las carreteras de estados unidos en 1967 se instala la primera maquiladora ese fue el principio para que se instalaran otras pero la mano de obra no era suficiente y entonces empiezan a venir de otras partes incluso del pa s ah es donde se dispara el n mero de habitantes llega un momento en que es m s la gente de otras partes que la gente de aqu empiezan a aumentar las casas comerciales restaurantes a pesar de que la mayor a compra en estados unidos se generaron empleos indirectos el boom de los inmigrantes al descubrir que esta pasada no es tan dif cil se empieza a notar aproximadamente en 1975 pero de una manera incipiente el problema grave se genera desde hace unos ocho a os aunque ahorita disminuy en un 70 por los eventos del 11 de septiembre pero esto trajo como consecuencia que agua prieta se empezara a extender de una manera desordenada porque ni las autoridades municipales ni estatales ni otra estaban preparadas para recibir esa cantidad de gente un gran porcentaje no cumple su objetivo y empiezan a quedarse a trabajar en hoteles restaurantes que empiezan a abrirse como si fueran mezquitera de repente nos llenamos de casas de hu spedes y de hoteles
9102672 definitivamente aunque pasaron unos a os para que nosotros nos di ramos cuenta sobre todo en seguridad p blica si hablamos de los a os sesentas si se comet a un crimen eso nos daba material para comentarlo un a o o dos porque no est bamos acostumbrados nos aterrorizaba y ahora es el pan nuestro de cada d a hay asaltos secuestros no es privativo de agua prieta pero quienes siempre hemos vivido aqu nos aterra esta situaci n empieza el problema de la escasez de los servicios p blicos de vigilancia esa es la principal diferencia que notamos quienes siempre hemos residido aqu la falta de comunicaci n entre la misma sociedad tal vez porque es m s la gente de fuera que la de agua prieta
9102673 el flotante viene con una mira diferente muy especial la mayor a de cruzar la frontera pero los que ya se quedan los que se asientan aqu vienen con otras costumbres con otra manera de ver las cosas con otra forma de vida y a ellos se les hace m s f cil sobre todo sorprender a mucha gente que todav a es confiada tranquila que todav a ve las cosas con m s bondad pero yo creo que la delincuencia no es de parte de la gente que va de paso de los que van de paso y se asientan aqu s a pesar de ser frontera se manten a relativamente tranquila era un lugar sin drogadicci n hoy d a es un grave problema genera muchos problemas
9102674 creo que es la descomposici n social que tenemos simplemente la televisi n nos hace ver un mundo que no es real y nos hace ver mucha violencia yo no me puedo explicar a qu se deba eso pero creo que es la falta de cultura hemos visto con mucha indiferencia el aspecto cultural y creo que junto con el deporte son aspectos que pueden atenuar un poco esa situaci n somos un pa s estancado en cuesti n cultural
9102675 era alta y delgada no era muy alegre su nica ilusi n que ten a era la televisi n pero la m sica nunca le gust ni los bailes vaga s con las amigas pero bailes no era muy buena persona yo verdaderamente nunca le ense a cuidarse porque ella vivi en la casa hogar la divina providencia ah creci ah se hizo se orita a mi me la entregaron de quince a os a esa edad ya no quiso estar ella conmigo ella se empez a salir de la casa yo no tuve la manera de platicar ni de llamarle la atenci n no le di consejo no alcanc a aconsejarla
9102676 no se trata de casos vinculados o enlazados a los cerca de trescientos asesinatos de mujeres que se han ejecutado en ciudad ju rez chihuahua son casos muy aislados durante mi estancia al frente de la pgj a partir de octubre de 1997 en realidad no se hab a presentado un caso de esa naturaleza en donde un sujeto cruel y abominable violara y diera muerte a dos mujeres es un tipo al que considero enfermo hemos analizado su antecedente familiar fue v ctima de violencia intrafamiliar indudablemente que viene arrastrando frustraciones incluso hereditarias muy profundas nuestra percepci n por los estudios y an lisis que hemos recogido de nuestras trabajadoras sociales y psic logas que trabajan en el centro de atenci n a v ctimas del delito pero ya est identificado son las nicas dos muertes de esta naturaleza que se han presentado durante estos cuatro a os y meses que han transcurrido durante mi administraci n al frente de la procuradur a obviamente no es posible prever estas situaciones acciones surgen en una forma s bita en donde un enfermo de esta naturaleza incurre en tales atrocidades
9102677 ju rez es muy distinto ah se han detectado seg n tengo informaci n verdaderas bandas organizaciones delictivas que tienden a apoderarse pr cticamente de las damas de las chicas de las ni as y posteriormente ejecutar las violaciones y posteriormente las privan de la vida lo marcado en este aspecto es la impunidad que es un factor que impulsa a la delincuencia si no se act a si no se aprehende a los criminales pues contin an incurriendo en sus acciones delictivas y por otra parte estimulan a los dem s a cometer este tipo de delitos a sabiendas de que no va a haber acci n eficaz hacia ellos por parte de la procuradur a de justicia de aquella entidad federativa chihuahua agua prieta es distinto no tenemos ese fen meno crimin geno que prevalece en ciudad ju rez una ciudad altamente poblada con carencias de todo tipo agua prieta no es una ciudad que tenga una sobrepoblaci n tan intensa tan grave no hay organizaciones criminales como existen en ciudad ju rez es otra contextura social es otra sociedad compleja obviamente pero distinta nosotros hemos implantado la presencia efectiva de la polic a judicial del estado el desplazamiento recorridos revisi n de personas revisi n constante de veh culos con el prop sito de detectar personas extra as de dudosa actividad y ha surtido efecto hemos tenido sobre todo el apoyo muy importante del ej rcito mexicano hemos creado en agua prieta hemos instituido una base operativa mixta est integrada por 22 elementos del ej rcito mexicano 15 elementos de la polic a judicial del estado tambi n la conforman 2 elementos de la polic a preventiva municipal 4 de la polic a federal preventiva 2 de la polic a judicial federal ahora agencia federal investigadora y encabezados por un agente del ministerio p blico federal y un agente del ministerio p blico del fuero com n esta base ha venido desestimulando la delincuencia la ha venido inhibiendo los resultados son eficaces pero es m s efectiva en la disuasi n
9102678 agua prieta no tiene ndices altos de delincuencia tiene delitos impactantes eso es lo que a veces se toma en consideraci n para sobredimensionar o magnificar la criminalidad en una sociedad trabajamos en colaboraci n con el fbi y con la border patrol de douglas y de ese condado su colaboraci n es la informaci n nosotros entramos ya a un periodo de modernizaci n en donde contamos con un sistema de inform tica muy avanzado tenemos bases de datos sobre la delincuencia y sobre el delito y un mapa geogr fico o tambi n se le llama la geograf a del delito en donde se analizan las zonas de riesgo y qu delitos prevalecen con mayor intensidad en cada uno de los barrios o colonias de esa ciudad estados unidos por su parte nos trasfiere informaci n de probables delincuentes que incurran en acciones transgresivas a la ley tanto en agua prieta como en el otro lado en estados unidos de norteam rica nos proporcionan a diario el n mero de veh culos robados y sus caracter sticas personas que probablemente cometieron latrocinio igualmente hacemos nosotros nos proporcionan los informes de la delincuencia que se realiza en esa zona igualmente nosotros se la proporcionamos con los datos de los probables delincuentes han coadyuvado en forma muy eficaz ltimamente nos han aprehendido algunos homicidas y nos los han puesto a disposici n homicidas que ya est n en prisi n hay muy buena cooperaci n estamos muy pendientes de la frontera de agua prieta como lo hacemos con nogales donde hay otra base mixta donde se ha aplacado la delincuencia en san luis colorado tenemos otra base operativa mixta
9102679 en agua prieta est trabajando tambi n el grupo beta que depende directamente de la secretar a de gobernaci n en la franja fronteriza para proteger a los migrantes ese es un problema serio el de los migrantes un problema en donde arriban diariamente cientos de personas que provienen del sur del pa s con el prop sito de pasar al otro lado y eso va creando cinturones de ciudadanos que carecen de trabajo de un medio de sustento se van quedando con el prop sito de aprovechar descuidos de la patrulla fronteriza de los estados unidos de norteam rica los detienen regresan y vuelven a hacer intentos y ese cintur n de ciudadanos mexicanos y extranjeros que se van instalando van creando una situaci n de riesgo delictivo porque entre ellos en un momento dado se roban se asaltan surgen contiendas hay lesiones y llegan incluso hasta el homicidio
9102680 hemos hecho an lisis por ejemplo de la ropa que tra an las mujeres d nde las adquirieron qui n se las suministr de las manchas de sangre los residuos de semen que se recolectaron la forma y circunstancia en que murieron de ah que hemos recogido infinidad de datos que involucran al posible responsable con estos asesinatos porque encontramos en el veh culo por ejemplo en el tapete las huellas de los tenis de una de las ni as sacrificadas adem s encontramos cabellos que coinciden con los de la difunta en un estudio criminal stico efectuado encontramos en un cateo efectuado en la casa donde vive el presunto responsable un pantal n tipo pants rasgado en donde le faltaban algunos pedazos de tela y efectivamente con esos pedazos de tela no solamente estaba amordazada sino que estaba amarrada entonces se hizo el an lisis comparativo y los pedazos de tela encuadraban perfectamente en el pantal n de donde fueron arrancados de la rodilla hacia abajo hay muchos elementos y son peritajes y dict menes criminal sticos en fin una serie de elementos que hemos ido recogiendo y que hemos ido acumulando y que la presunci n m s fuerte es que este joven ah viv a permanentemente en agua prieta y en cuanto se le busc se le llev a un consultorio qu mico para hacerle una prueba de esperma y compararlo con el que encontramos en las mujeres y desgraciadamente escap del ba o del qu mico rompi la ventana y huy no pudo localizarlo la polic a y tenemos datos de que posiblemente se encuentre en la ciudad de chihuahua lo hemos buscado mucho pero no lo hemos localizado si era inocente no ten a por qu huir bueno son situaciones que se presentan estamos integrando la averiguaci n para ver si alguien le facilit esa evasi n o no lo m s importante es que sabemos que no obedecen estas dos muertes a una delincuencia organizada son casos aislados definitivamente de un tipo enfermo desviado mentalmente
9102681 yo no dir a que en sonora hayan aumentado las muertes en contra de mujeres en algunos casos ha habido sa a ha habido exacerbaci n en la actuaci n delictiva otras han sido muertes de un balazo yo pienso que esto est muy relacionado con la personalidad del criminal verdaderamente son enfermos mentales son enfermos emocionales solamente a ello puede obedecer esa crueldad con que asesinan a las mujeres en determinados casos son individuos con profundas taras hereditarias creo yo o problemas emocionales intensos cargas emocionales muy profundas que no encuentran otro desahogo sino en la manifestaci n violenta en contra de una mujer y cuando esa enfermedad tiene un trasfondo er tico sexual pues se vuelca en contra de la mujer
9102682 poder ser til para acelerar a investiga o cl nica com c lulas estaminais humanas porque os porcos fazem parte dos animais mais pr ximos dos seres humanos
9102683 os porcos verdes n o podem ser cruzados com esp cies selvagens e dar origem a frankenporcos
9102684 now obama who has spent two years preventing a woman from being president will spend two months preventing one from becoming vice president and hopes to do so with women votes
9102685 es diferente seg n donde est s desde el que tiene el poder para fundarla como en m xico que obligan a que las frecuencias se otorguen bajo un estricto control en otros pa ses como argentina donde no hay una legislaci n tan estricta s hay muchas radios comunitarias le llaman radios truchas es el equivalente a piratas surgen del trabajo de un barrio desde un garage patio son constantemente alimentadas por el mismo barrio o grupo de trabajo las que yo he o do son las de mi barrio villa del parque y un canal la utop a que no daba su direcci n lo comunitario si lo da quien lo hace y lo pirata c mo lo hace desde el punto de vista legal
9102686 radio bemba se inscribe en lo que se puede decir radio trucha es notoriamente comunitaria se ve una tendencia a organizar la informaci n es notoria la formaci n estudiantil de la radio por su nimo hay una intenci n de hablar un lenguaje com n a la juventud y de un trabajo experimental no en t rminos radiof nicos sino de ellos hay una interesante programaci n musical cierta m sica alternativa que no tiene cabida en las estaciones comerciales
9102687 desde mi punto de vista no es escandalizante s transgreden las formas tradicionales pero en los contenidos son las mismas quejas de los otros programas pero en un lenguaje actualizado creo que tienen el derecho de crear su estilo y es una intenci n de encontrar una identidad y hablar un mismo lenguaje que su p blico original porque ah surgi y de un sector de la comunidad que no tiene espacios
9102688 los conflictos existen y o est n solapados o se evidencian
9102689 es un programa de radio elaborado por estudiantes de diferentes universidades
9102690 ni incitamos a la violencia ni a la toma del poder estamos por la generaci n de la informaci n hacia una nueva realidad somos un medio m s si nos identifican con cuestiones guerrillerescas pues ni modo
9102691 el proyecto lo hab amos trabajado desde hace dos a os la gente que est aqu es la gente que m s ha aportado a la radio estudiantil de comunicaci n
9102692 el colectivo radio bemba fm deseando conocer la opini n de la sociedad organizaciones civiles comunidad acad mica comunidad estudiantil y la comunidad internacional convoca a los mismos a solidarizarse a favor de la permanencia de la primera radio comunitaria en nuestra ciudad cuyo objetivo es ser un espacio libre para la sociedad civil este proyecto parte de la declaraci n de mil n sobre medios de comunicaci n elaborada por la asociaci n mundial de radios comunitarias amarc de la cual es parte este proyecto y la que fundamenta nuestro ejercicio como radio comunitaria
9102693 no lo hemos decidido totalmente el problema va a ser para
9102694 hay una carta de diciembre donde avisamos al rector y vicerrector de que est bamos transmitiendo y nuestros objetivos y nunca tuvimos respuesta en ella no le ped amos nada la intenci n es el di logo primero porque la frecuencia se la dieron a radio universidad pero por qu no nos saca del aire l siempre ha dicho que nuestra labor es pol tica y no acad mica incluso envi una carta a cisen diciendo de nuestras transmisiones
9102695 muy sencillo que le den otra frecuencia por ejemplo la 97 5 en donde no hay ninguna nosotros estamos en lo legal el art culo sexto constitucional y el art culo diez y nueve de la declaraci n de los derechos humanos nos respaldan la ley federal de radio y televisi n est por debajo de la constituci n es una ley reglamentaria de hecho podr amos promover un amparo
9102696 en principio lo veo de la jodida es obvio que al principio todos buscamos modelos pero tampoco yo soy algo original tengo algo de otros todo tiene que ver con la congruencia tu estilo debe concordar con lo que quieres decir de hecho la misma m sica que programas debe ser congruente por ejemplo el rock es contestatario
9102697 si en alg n momento entramos a un contexto reglamentario s
9102698 lo he visto desde adentro no tengo la intenci n de censurar a nadie cada quien que escuche lo que quiera pero por qu no decirlo yo he sido v ctima de esa radio es un negocio mercantil est n hechas para vender no le puedes pedir nada a alguien que se maneja en costos y ganancias el mismo espacio y el querer conservar ese espacio nos hace hacernos al formato s me parecen excesivamente light es como los maestros que te traen material para machetear y no te hacen reflexionar son modelos y si te sales de ah est s mal ahora las compa as disqueras son muy crueles hay una cuesti n financiera ah pero igual es respetable el chiste es que salgan m s estaciones ojal en cada barrio hubiera una estaci n de radio

9102714 puasa adalah perisai seorang hamba berperisai dengannya dari api neraka
9102715 barangsiapa yang berpuasa sehari di jalan allah maka di antara dia dan neraka ada parit yang luasnya seperti antara langit dengan bumi

9102717 meninggalkan makan minum dan syahwatnya karena puasa untuk ku dan aku yang akan membalasnya kebaikan dibalas dengan sepuluh kali lipat yang semisal dengannya
9102718 semua amalan bani adam akan dilipatgandakan kebaikan dibalas dengan sepuluh kali lipat yang semisal dengannya sampai tujuh ratus kali lipat
9102719 kecuali puasa karena puasa itu untuk ku dan aku yang akan membalasnya dia bani adam meninggalkan syahwatnya dan makanannya karena aku
9102720 puasa dan akan memberikan syafaat kepada hamba di hari kiamat puasa akan berkata
9102721 aku telah menghalanginya dari tidur di malam hari maka berilah dia syafaat karenaku
9102722 dan sempurnakanlah olehmu ibadah haji dan umrah karena allah maka jika kamu terkepung terhalang oleh musuh atau sakit maka wajib menyembelih kurban yang mudah didapat dan janganlah kamu mencukur rambut kepalamu hingga kurban itu sampai ke tempat penyembelihannya jika ada diantaramu yang sakit atau ada gangguan di kepalanya lalu ia bercu kur maka wajib atasnya berfidyah yaitu berpuasa atau bersedekah atau berkurban apabila kamu telah merasa aman maka bagi siapa yang ingin mengerjakan umrah sebelum haji di dalam bulan haji wajiblah ia menyembelih kurban yang mudah di dapat tetapi jika ia tidak menemukan binatang kurban atau tidak mampu maka wajib berpuasa tiga hari dalam masa haji dan tujuh hari lagi apabila kamu telah pulang kembali demikian itu kewajiban membayar fidyah bagi orang orang yang keluargannya tidak berada di sekitar masjidil haram orang orang yang bukan penduduk kota makkah dan bertakwalah kepada allah dan ketahuilah bahwa allah sangat keras siksa nya
9102723 dan jika ia si terbunuh dari kaum kafir yang ada perjanjian damai antara mereka dengan kamu maka hendaklah si pembunuh membayar diat denda yang diserahkan kepada keluarganya si terbunuh serta memerdekakan hamba sahaya yang mukmin barangsiapa yang tidak memperolehnya maka hendaklah si pembunuh berpuasa dua bulan berturut turut sebagai cara taubat kepada allah dan adalah allah maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
9102724 allah tidak menghukum kamu disebabkan sumpah sumpahmu yang tidak dimaksud untuk bersumpah tetapi dia menghukum kamu disebabkan sumpah sumpah kamu yang kamu sengaja maka kafarat melanggar sumpah itu ialah memberi makan sepuluh orang miskin yaitu dari makanan yang biasa kamu berikan kepada keluargamu atau memberi pakaian kepada mereka atau memerdekakan seorang budak
9102725 orang orang yang menzhihar isteri mereka kemudian mereka hendak menarik kembali apa yang mereka ucapkan maka wajib atasnya memerdekakan seorang budak sebelum kedua suami istri itu bercampur demikianlah yang diajarkan kepada kamu dan allah maha mengetahui apa yang kamu kerjakan barangsiapa yang tidak mendapatkan budak maka wajib atasnya berpuasa dua bulan berturut turut sebelum keduanya bercampur maka siapa yang tidak kuasa wajib atasnya memberi makan enam puluh orang miskin demikianlah supaya kamu beriman kepada allah dan rasul nya dan itulah hukum hukum allah dan bagi orang orang kafir ada siksaan yang sangat pedih
9102726 fitnah pria dalam keluarga isteri harta dan tetangganya bisa dihapuskan oleh shalat puasa dan shadaqah
9102727 sesungguhnya dalam surga ada satu pintu yang disebut dengan rayyan orang orang yang puasa akan masuk di hari kiamat nanti dari pintu tersebut tidak ada orang selain mereka yang memasukinya jika telah masuk orang terkahir yang puasa ditutuplah pintu tersebut barangsiapa yang masuk akan minum dan barangsiapa yang minum tidak akan merasa haus untuk selamanya
9102728 sesunguhnya allah memaafkan bagi umatku apa yang terbetik dalam hatinya selama belum diucapkan atau diamalkannya
9102729 yaitu mereka yang beriman kepada yang ghaib yang mendirikan shalat dan menafkahkan sebagian rezki yang kami anugrahkan kepada mereka
9102730 puasalah kalian karena melihat hilal bulan baru red dan berbukalah karena melihat hilal jika kalian terhalangi awan sempurnakanlah bulan syaban tiga puluh hari
9102731 janganlah kalian puasa hingga melihat hilal jika kalian terhalangi awan hitunglah bulan syaban
9102732 jika datang bulan ramadhan puasalah tiga puluh hari kecuali kalian melihat hilal sebelum hari ketiga puluh
9102733 jangan kalian mendahului ramadhan dengan melakukan puasa satu atau dua hari sebelumnya kecuali seseorang yang telah rutin berpuasa maka berpuasalah
9102734 barangsiapa yang berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan berarti telah durhaka kepada abul qasim
9102735 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal berbukalah kalian karena melihatnya berhajilah kalian karena melihat hilal jika kalian tertutup awan maka sempurnakanlah bilangan bulan syaban menjadi tiga puluh hari jika ada dua saksi berpuasalah kalian dan berbukalah
9102736 manusia mencari cari hilal maka aku kabarkan kepada nabi bahwa aku melihatnya maka rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wassalam pun menyuruh manusia berpuasa
9102737 dan banyak ulama ahli tahqiq peneliti telah memilih madzhab jumhur ini diantara mereka adalah ibnu taimiyyah rahimahullah sebagaimana dalam majmu fatawa juz 25 asy syaukani dalam nailul authar dan shiddiq hasan khan dalam ar raudhatun nadiyyah dan selain mereka
9102738 mereka mengurusi lima urusan kita shalat jumat shalat jamaah ied perbatasan dan hukum had
9102739 puasa adalah hari puasanya kalian berbuka adalah hari berbukanya kalian dan iedul adha adalah hari kalian menyembelih
9102740 at tirmidzi berkata setelah menyebutkan hadits itu sebagian ahlul ilmi menafsirkan hadits ini mengatakan bahwa maknanya adalah berpuasa dan berbuka dilakukan bersama jamaah dan kebanyakan manusia
9102741 di dalamnya terdapat dalil agar menganggap ketetapan ied itu bersamaan dengan manusia dan bahwa yang menyendiri dalam mengetahui hari ied dengan melihat hilal maka ia wajib menyesuaikan diri dengan manusia dan wajib baginya mengikuti hukum mereka dalam hal shalat berbuka dan menyembelih iedul adha
9102742 dikatakan bahwa di dalam hadits itu ada bantahan atas orang yang mengatakan sesungguhnya orang yang mengetahui terbitnya bulan dengan hisab boleh puasa sendirian di luar mereka yang belum tahu dikatakan pula sesungguhnya satu orang saksi jika melihat hilal dan hakim belum menerima persaksiannya maka hari tersebut tidak menjadi hari puasa baginya sebagaimana tidak menjadi hari puasa bagi manusia yang lain
9102743 nampaknya perkara perkara ini tidak ada celah bagi individu individu untuk masuk di dalamnya tidak bisa mereka menyendiri dalam masalah tersebut bahkan perkara itu diserahkan kepada pemerintah dan jamaah masyarakat dan wajib bagi setiap orang untuk mengikuti pemerintah dan jamaah masyarakat atas dasar ini jika seseorang melihat hilal lalu imam pemerintah menolak persaksiannya maka mestinya ia tidak menetapkan untuk dirinya sesuatu apapun dari perkara ini dan wajib baginya untuk mengikuti jamaah masyarakat
9102744 makna inilah yang langsung dipahami dalam hadits dan itu didukung oleh perbuatan aisyah radiyallahu anha yang berhujjah dengannya kepada masruq ketika ia tidak mau puasa arafah karena khawatir ternyata itu hari nahr 10 dzulhijjah yakni hari raya
9102745 hari nahr adalah ketika orang orang menyembelih dan iedul fithri adalah ketika orang orang berbuka
9102746 inilah yang cocok bagi syariat yang toleran yang diantara tujuannya adalah menyatukan manusia dan barisan mereka serta menjauhkan mereka dari dari pendapat pendapat pribadi yang menceraiberaikan kesatuan mereka syariat tidak menganggap pendapat pribadi walaupun itu benar dari sisi pandangnya dalam ibadah yang sifatnya berjamaah seperti puasa ied dan shalat berjamaah tidakkah engkau melihat bahwa para shahabat shalat di belakang yang lain padahal diantara mereka ada yang berpendapat bahwa menyentuh wanita kemaluan dan keluarnya darah membatalkan wudhu dan diantara mereka juga ada yang tidak berpendapat demikian diantara mereka ada yang melakukan shalat 4 rakaat dalam safar dan diantaranya juga ada yang 2 rakaat namun demikian perbedaan ini dan yang lain tidak menghalangi mereka untuk bersama sama dalam melakukan shalat di belakang satu imam dan menganggap shalat itu sah hal itu karena mereka mengetahui bahwa perpecahan dalam agama lebih jelek daripada perbedaan dalam sebagian pendapat maka hendaknya mereka memperhatikan hadits ini dan riwayat yang disebutkan yaitu mereka yang mengaku aku mengetahui ilmu falak yang memulai puasa sendiri dan berbuka sendiri mendahului atau membelakangi mayoritas muslimin dengan bersandar pada pendapat dan ilmunya tanpa peduli manakala keluar dari jamaah hendaknya mereka semua memperhatikan apa yang kami sebut dari ilmu ini barangkali mereka akan mendapatkan obat dari kebodohan dan kesombongan yang menimpa mereka sehingga mereka menjadi satu shaf bersama kaum muslimin karena sesungguhnya tangan allah taala bersama jamaah
9102747 seseorang melihat hilal sendirian dan benar benar melihatnya apakah dia boleh berbuka dan berpuasa sendirian atau bersama kebanyakan manusia
9102748 alhamdulillah jika dia melihat hilal maka berpuasa atau berbuka sendirian apakah ia berkewajiban untuk berpuasa dengan dan berbuka dengan ruyah sendiri atau tidak puasa serta berbuka kecuali bersama manusia maka dalam hal ini ada tiga pendapat dan tiga riwayat dari al imam ahmad
9102749 puasa kalian adalah pada hari kalian berpuasa berbukanya kalian adalah ketika kalian berbuka dan hari iedul adha kalian adalah tatkala kalian menyembelih
9102750 hadits ini dishahihkan oleh asy syaikh al albani rahimahullah dalam silsilah ash shahihah no 224
9102751 puasa adalah pada hari kalian berpuasa berbuka adalah hari ketika kalian berbuka dan iedul adha adalah hari ketika kalian menyembelih
9102752 sesungguhnya makna hadits ini adalah berpuasa dan berbuka dilakukan bersama jamaah manusia dan kebanyakan manusia
9102753 berbukanya kalian adalah hari tatkala kalian berbuka dan adha kalian adalah hari kalian menyembelih semua tanah arafah adalah tempat wuquf semua tanah mina adalah tempat menyembelih dan semua gang gang makkah adalah tempat menyembelih dan semua tanah jam muzdalifah adalah tempat wuquf
9102754 dan mereka bertanya kepadamu tentang hilal hilal katakanlah itu untuk manusia dan untuk ibadah haji
9102755 diwajibkan atas kalian berpuasa sebagaimana diwajibkan atas orang orang sebelum kalian agar kalian bertakwa yaitu dalam beberapa hari tertentu maka barangsiapa diantara kamu ada yang sakit atau dalam perjalanan lalu ia berbuka maka wajiblah baginya berpuasa sebanyak hari yang ditinggalkan itu pada hari hari yang lain dan wajib bagi orang orang yang berat menjalankannya jika mereka tidak berpuasa membayar fidyah yaitu memberi makan seorang miskin barangsiapa yang dengan kerelaan hati mengerjakan kebajikan maka itulah yang lebih baik baginya dan berpuasa lebih baik bagimu jika kamu mengetahui
9102756 puasa kalian adalah pada hari kalian berpuasa bukanya kalian adalah ketika kalian berbuka dan hari iedul adha kalian adalah hari tatkala kalian menyembelih
9102757 berpuasa bersama imam dan jamaah muslimin dalam keadaan udara cerah maupun mendung
9102758 jika kalian melihatnya maka puasalah padanya dan jika kalian melihatnya maka berbukalah padanya dan puasalah dari rembulan kepada rembulan
9102759 puasa kalian adalah pada hari kalian berpuasa bukanya kalian adalah ketika kalian berbuka dan hari iedul adha kalian adalah hari tatkala kalian menyembelih
9102760 berbuka adalah ketika manusia berbuka dan iedul adha adalah ketika manusia menyembelih
9102761 bulan sabit itu adalah tanda tanda waktu bagi manusia dan bagi ibadah haji dan bukanlah kebajikan memasuki rumah rumah dari belakangnya akan tetapi kebajikan itu ialah kebajikan orang yang bertakwa dan masuklah ke rumah rumah itu dari pintu pintunya dan bertakwalah kepada allah agar kalian beruntung
9102762 puasa kalian adalah pada hari kalian berpuasa bukanya kalian adalah ketika kalian berbuka dan hari iedul adha kalian adalah hari tatkala kalian menyembelih
9102763 kalau bukan karena temanmu maka aku akan menyakitimu dengan pukulan
9102764 adapun salah satunya adalah hari berbukanya kalian dari puasa yang lain adalah hari makannya kalian dari hasil sembelihan kalian
9102765 mereka itu shalat untuk kalian jika mereka benar maka pahala shalat itu untuk kalian dan untuk mereka namun jika mereka salah maka untuk kalian pahalanya dan kesalahannya ditanggung mereka

9102775 beauty is of soft whisperings she speaks in our spirit her voice yields to our silences like a faint light that quivers in fear of the shadow

9102796 on closer inspection the country we have inhabited for the last three decades seems more like a panorama of madness and delusion of sturdy patriots reciting the pledge while they resolutely strangle their own life chances of small farmers proudly voting themselves off the land of devoted family men carefully seeing to it that their children will never be able to afford college or proper health care of hardened blue collar workers in midwestern burgs cheering as they deliver up a landslide for a candidate whose policies will end their way of life

9102856 i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9102857 washington has been talking about oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9102858 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day senator mccain took office
9102859 since canada is our 1 supplier us election obama shares a vision and plan to fulfill americas promise
9102860 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9102861 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9102862 the announcement of governor palins selection on john mccains 72nd birthday highlights the fact t hat the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one sarah palin is a 2 year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of 9 000
9102863 to assume that women will simply support governor palin because of her gender is insulting in fact the governor is out of step with mainstream america on womens economic and social issues for example governor palin embraces john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade and protecting a womens right to make her own health care decisions
9102864 governor palin has also enthusiastically supported the bush mccain doctrine of standing up for big oil and failed economic policies that has led to a struggling economy
9102865 well this is obviously just a pick to try and win women voters
9102866 to any critics who say a woman cant think and work and carry a baby at the same time id just like to escort that neanderthal back to the cave
9102867 why not have a republican woman break the glass ceiling
9102868 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states
9102869 im not george bush im the guy you thought well of back in 2000

9102879 however the declarations came just days two days after the venezuelan national guard beat and detained alternative media workers and leaders of a humanitarian delegation en route to assist the yukpa in the occupied lands causing many to suspect regional and local authorities willingly contradict central government policies in the conflict ridden coal rich zone known as the sierra de perij
9102880 minister ortega asserted that the commissions will work permanently until solving the problem and submitting the results to popular vote

9102970 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9102971 i am absolutely delighted by this selection once again john mccain has shown that he is an independent thinker who paints in bold strokes sarah palin is a conservative reformer with executive experience who will bring a breath of fresh air to washington she will be an ideal running mate for john mccain and will make a major contribution to our countrys future
9102972 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9102973 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9102974 john mccains selection of sarah palin raises serious questions about his judgment why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did why with so many other qualified women and men in his party did john mccain choose sarah palin sarah palin is not the right choice
9102975 sarah palin is pleasant surprise for those of us who had hoped that senator mccain would pick a principled and authentic conservative pro life leader and sarah palin is
9102976 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign

9102985 i saw the back hindquarters they really struck me along with the striped markings on the animal
9102986 i have been travelling on country roads for a long time i know what i saw
9102987 it was crossing the road it had a long tail stripes and a puggy face it was too big to be a fox
9102988 at first i thought it was a kangaroo then i saw these bright blue eyes reflecting
9102989 i then thought it was a fox but when i got closer it was too big to be a fox it was shaped a bit like a greyhound and it had a very large chest

9103030 barangsiapa yang berperang di jalan allah lalu gugur terbunuh atau memperoleh kemenangan maka kelak akan kami berikan kepadanya pahala yang besar
9103031 dan belanjakanlah harta bendamu di jalan allah dan janganlah kamu menjatuhkan dirimu sendiri ke dalam kebinasaan dan berbuat baiklah karena sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat baik

9103042 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about
9103043 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think
9103044 she is a reform minded woman who will give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9103045 the majority of american women support commonsense restrictions on abortion adding palin to the gop ticket will resonate with independent women voters nationwide
9103046 governor palin is a committed and active christian who takes her faith seriously and lives her pro life and pro family convictions

9103053 kanak kanak dan golongan remaja cenderung untuk berhadapan dengan masalah ini berbanding golongan dewasa
9103054 osteosarcoma adalah barah tulang yang biasa menyerang golongan muda belasan tahun dengan golongan lelaki lebih terdedah kepadanya berbanding perempuan ia akan terjadi di hujung tulang kerana sebagai orang muda di situlah tisu tulang baru tumbuh
9103055 sebenarnya kanser yang terjadi di dalam tulang agak jarang berlaku ia tidak mudah merebak dari satu bahagian tulang ke bahagian tulang yang lain jika keadaan ini berlaku ia tidak dipanggil barah tulang kerana setiap jenis barah dinamakan mengikut organ atau tisu yang terjejas
9103056 kita panggil keadaan ini barah tulang secondary antara barah yang boleh menjejaskan tulang adalah barah payu dara paru paru prostat buah pinggang dan tyroid

9103061 sekurang kurangnya satu per tiga daripada semua kes af adalah kekal atau kronik ini bermakna gejala ini tidak mungkin dapat dikawal dengan ubat ubatan menjadikan pembedahan pilihan yang terbaik bagi sesetengah pesakit af kronik
9103062 af mungkin boleh berlaku kepada sesiapa sahaja di mana di antara 10 hingga 30 peratus kes af berlaku kepada individu sihat yang tidak mempunyai sebab untuk mendapat aritmia
9103063 sesetengah keadaan yang biasa mempunyai kaitan dengan af termasuklah tekanan darah tinggi penyakit jantung koronari dan penyakit injap jantung
9103064 af juga boleh berlaku akibat ketagihan alkohol penyakit kelenjar tiroid dan kegagalan jantung kongestif tekanan fizikal mahupun psikologi serta pengambilan ubat ubat perangsang
9103065 rawatan asas bagi af adalah dengan pengambilan ubat ubatan pada setiap hari seperti agen antiaritmia dan antikoagulan untuk mencairkan darah seperti warfarin
9103066 pilihan rawatan lain termasuklah kardioversi alat defibrilasi perentak jantung ablasi katerer pembedahan maze dan pembedahan ablasi

9103726 now mondale tried to shake things up by going with geraldine ferraro she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful
9103727 and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9103728 it is a real role of the dice and shows how john mccain karl rove et al realize what a strong position the obama biden team and democrats in general are in in this election
9103729 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling i particularly look forward to the biden palin debate in missouri
9103730 the big question now is whether ubs the supposed giant of swiss banking will have the guts to take a strong stand based on the swiss bank secrecy laws and fight for the principle of its clients financial privacy even if ubs is willing to abandon its american customers to the irs i suspect that official switzerland is going to stand and fight for their basic bank secrecy laws laws that have been revised and updated to accommodate reasonable law enforcement requirements
9103731 i reaffirmed the offer by the swiss government to cooperate constructively with the u
9103732 i underlined however that we expect them not to take unilateral steps against ubs to obtain information which is located in switzerland as long as the agreed bilateral legal cooperation is ongoing
9103733 ubs is seeking to address these requests with both swiss and u s government authorities within the legal framework for intergovernmental cooperation and assistance established between switzerland and the u s a ubs spokesman said in zurich
9103734 this is a direct and coordinated attack on the heart of the swiss financial system this is a long term threat that will not go away and there is not too much switzerland can do

9103814 youve never seen scenery like you will in santorini and being there was very cheap
9103815 it just happened to be culture week so everything was free when i was there
9103816 i went to the colosseum the vatican the vatican museum and much more all for free
9103817 my sister brianna and both of my parents came over to europe my sister stayed for a whole month and we went to spain and the netherlands together
9103818 my parents came over for two weeks and the four of us went to switzerland paris and spent new years in london
9103819 i made many friends during my stay in grenoble my friends are from all over the world just a few countries where they live include iceland columbia greece mexico sweden india china and thailand
9103820 now because of this experience i can go anywhere in the world and have a friend to stay with
9103821 austria has the most amazing architecture in my opinion of any other country
9103822 i got a chance to throw my two coins into this fountain one coin for a wish and one coin to some day return to rome
9103823 i believe what will help me the most in my career was not what i learned in a book in class or what the teachers taught us but what i learned by working with peers from all over the world we had a lot of teamwork and i had to work with many different individuals with different beliefs backgrounds and work ethic
9103824 it was very trying at times to work under these conditions but it is amazing to be given an assignment and be able to complete it with your teammates
9103825 it was during those weeks when time allowed that i took full advantage of the opportunity to travel
9103826 the language barrier was definitely an issue especially in the beginning i had never studied french before only spanish so this proved to be quite difficult
9103827 once school started i was required by the school to take a french class once a week to build on my french skills
9103828 at least theres someone out there whos really fanatical about your work

9103834 we take the bus back home to cook lunch in my apartment kitchen i never plan a menu instead i always hope people will find things at the market theyve never tasted or even seen and will be curious enough to want to try them
9103835 i have watched that chant become a staple of broncos home games and its one of the only things we do at invesco that originated at mile high
9103836 as someone who has been to other stadiums i know you can attest to the uniqueness of this tradition some stadiums have a first down chant such as arrowhead while places like lambeau have the go pack go
9103837 all of them are meant for one thing the enjoyment and involvement of the fans at the game and each of them are meant to be unique and that describes in com plete to a tee
9103838 in which they assume control of a players character and turn it into a high powered hero far faster than the original owner could manage themselves
9103839 she wouldnt have articulated one coherent policy and people would just be fawning all over her
9103840 tony and i looked at each other and it was like this isnt about policy or alaska issues this is about peoples most basic instincts i like you and you make me feel good
9103841 it speaks volumes about her personally and about how she walked her talk
9103842 i initially became aware of gold farming through my own games playing but assumed it was just a cottage industry
9103843 in a way that is still true its just that instead of a few dozen cottages there turn out to be tens of thousands
9103844 i was drawn to write about gold farming due to my perception that its a significant phenomenon that academics and development organisations are unaware of
9103845 the indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400 000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900 000
9103846 nonetheless the two are still comparable in employment size yet not at all in terms of profile
9103847 or at least the edges of a digital underworld populated by scammers and hackers and pornographers and which has spread to the
9103848 when you get people with more money than time and time than money the two will find a way to meet
9103849 i got word of it the actual choice this morning
9103850 i did talk to sen mccain by phone early this morning it was a wonderful conversation i congratulated him on the pick and told him im very excited about the pick
9103851 i think sarah palin is a bold choice and im going to work hard for the ticket but i have to be candid i have no doubt that the best choice would have been tim pawlenty
9103852 i just have to be frank and honest i would have loved to have seen him get the nod i think he would have been absolutely tremendous
9103853 selfishly im happy to have tim pawlenty in minnesota for as long as we can keep him im certain hell be on the short list for mccain administration positions
9103854 i know the governor must be very disappointed hes worked very hard in the last year to attain the vice presidency
9103855 as someone who also appointed a strong female as his running mate im sure he understands the choice that senator mccain made
9103856 i started with this effort because i believe strongly and firmly in senator mccain
9103857 a slap in the face to gov tim pawlenty who campaigned at mccains side even in mccains darkest hours a year ago when even mccains staff deserted him
9103858 if you go into the united arab emirates census youll find there is around 12 000 australians living in dubai mostly male mostly in the 25 to 34 year age group
9103859 here is an example of one country that has drawn out a specific age demographic out of australia which has contributed to the man drought
9103860 oh mickey youre so fine youre so fine you blow my mind
9103861 shes in talks to have a guest spot on one of their high profile shows the top choice is 30 rock but if that doesnt work out theyll try to find another show for her to make an appearance on
9103862 for years i tried to get producers to have vinny sell his hummer and buy a prius then i realized this show is entertainment i know that entourage is often demeaning and crude but theres also a lot of social commentary
9103863 our goal is to get the iphone client out as quickly as possible because it does represent a significant percentage of the devices touching our network
9103864 the apple guys are really smart and they have a beautiful phone
9103865 we should be thankful instead of whining about things even when we dont get what we want
9103866 the nyu administration needs to open its books to gain the trust of students and community members
9103867 this is an issue that affects everyone connected to nyu
9103868 the administration is changing our school without ever really talking to students we need real dialogue to make this university work
9103869 our tuition supports what they do i think they need to be held accountable to us
9103870 when i look at the board of trustees i dont see anyone who really represents me
9103871 its a bunch of lawyers and ceos they arent in debt they dont know what it means to be a student here
9103872 i want my school to be run ethically taking into account the interests of the students
9103873 right now the administration could be doing anything they wanted and wed never know about it
9103874 dont be so naive amp self confident forget about self confidence its useless
9103875 kemudian mereka ahlis sunnah wal jamaah selain merealisasikan prinsip prinsip ini saling memerintahkan dengan yang baik dan melarang dari yang mungkar sesuai yang diajarkan dalam syariat
9103876 permisalan peran seorang mukmin terhadap seorang mukmin lain bagaikan sebuah bangunan yang kokoh yang sebagiannya menopang menguatkan sebagian lainnya
9103877 orang mukmin yang paling sempurna keimanannya adalah orang yang paling baik akhlaqnya
9103878 seandainya allah memberi petunjuk denganmu seseorang saja itu lebih baik bagimu dibanding memiliki unta merah
9103879 pergilah kamu berdua kepada firaun sesungguhnya dia telah malampaui batas maka berbicaralah kamu berdua kepadanya dengan kata kata yang lemah lembut
9103880 maka bersabarlah kamu seperti orang orang yang mempunyai keteguhan hati dari rasul rasul ulul azmi telah bersabar dan janganlah kamu meminta disegerakan azab bagi mereka
9103881 bersikap mudarah terhadap orang lain adalah dengan beramah tamah kepada mereka berhubungan dengan cara yang baik dan bersabar menghadapi gangguan mereka agar mereka tidak menjauh darimu
9103882 mereka menginginkan agar engkau berpura pura dihadapan mereka sehingga mereka juga akan berpura pura pula dihadapanmu
9103883 syariat menghajer berbeda beda sejalan dengan perbedaan orang yang menerapkannya dipandang dari kuat tidaknya dan sedikit banyaknya jumlah mereka karena tujuan dari penerapan hajer boikot adalah menghardik orang yang dihajer diboikot memberi pelajaran kepadanya dan agar masyarakat umum meninggalkan kesalahan tersebut sehingga apabila manfaat dan kemaslahatan yang dipetik dari sikap hajer boikot lebih besar dibanding dengan kerugiannya sehingga dengan ia diboikot kejelekan menjadi melemah dan sirna maka pada saat itulah hajer boikot disyariatkan akan tetapi bila orang yang diboikot dan orang lainnya tidak menjadi jera bahkan kejelekannya semakin bertambah sedangkan pelaku hajer boikot kedudukannya lemah sehingga kerugian yang ditimbulkan lebih besar dibanding maslahatnya maka pada keadaan yang demikian ini tidak disyariatkan hajer boikot bahkan menarik simpati sebagian orang itu lebih berguna dibanding memboikotnya dan memboikot sebagian lainnya lebih berguna dibanding menarik simpatinya oleh karena itu dahulu nabi e menarik simpati sebagian orang dan memboikot sebagian lainnya yang demikian ini sebagaimana halnya menghadapi musuh kadang kala disyariatkan peperangan dan kadang kala perdamaian dan kadang kala dengan cara mengambil jizyah upeti semua itu disesuaikan dengan situasi dan kemaslahatan jawaban para imam seperti imam ahmad dan lainnya tentang permasalahan ini didasari oleh prinsip tersebut
9103884 sesungguhnya sebagian orang menjadikan hal tersebut hajer atau menarik simpati sebagai suatu keumuman sehingga mereka menghajer atau mengingkari orang yang tidak disyariatkan tidak diwajibkan dan juga tidak disunnahkan dan mungkin saja dikarenakan kesalahan ini menyebabkannya meninggalkan hal hal yang diwajibkan atau disunnahkan dan akibatnya ia melanggar hal hal yang diharamkan dan disisi lain ada sebagian orang yang berpaling dari itu semua sehingga ia enggan untuk membaoikot menjauhi sesuatu yang diperintahkan untuk diboikot dijauhi yaitu berupa hal hal buruk lagi bidah
9103885 oleh karena itu dahulu nabi e menarik perhatian sebagian orang dan memboikot sebagaian lainnya sebagaimana halnya tiga orang sahabat yang tidak ikut dalam perang tabuk ketiga tiganya lebih baik bila dibanding kebanyakan orang orang yang ditarik perhatiannya
9103886 hingga apabila bumi telah menjadi sempit bagi mereka padahal bumi itu luas dan jiwa merekapun telah sempit pula terasa oleh mereka serta mereka telah mengetahui bahwa tidak ada tempat lari dari siksa allah melainkan kepada nya saja qs at taubah 118
9103887 oleh karena itu hendaknya dibedakan antara tempat tempat yang banyak terjadi praktek praktek bidah sebagaimana halnya yang terjadi di kota bashrah banyak orang orang yang mengingkari taqdir qodariyah di kota khurasan banyak ahli nujum dan di kota kufah banyak orang orang syiah dengan tempat tempat yang tidak demikian halnya dan hendaknya dibedakan antara para pemimpin yang memiliki pengikut dengan lainnya dan apabila telah diketahui tujuan syariat maka hendaknya ditempuh jalan tercepat untuk mencapai tujuan tersebut
9103888 dalam kisah ini terdapat dalil bahwa pemboikotan seorang pemimpin atau ulama atau pemuka masyarakat terhadap orang yang melakukan suatu pelanggaran yang mengharuskan untuk dicela diboikot hendaknya pemboikotan tersebut merupakan obat yaitu dengan cara yang dapat merealisasikan perbaikan penyembuhan dan tidak berlebih baik dalam jumlah atau metode sehingga dapat membinasakan orang tersebut karena tujuannya pemboikotan adalah untuk memberikan pendidikan bukan membinasakan
9103889 tidak dibenarkan menolak kerusakan kecil dengan kerusakan besar juga tidak dibenarkan mencegah kerugian ringan dengan melakukan kerugian yang lebih besar karena syariat islam senantiasa mengajarkan agar senantiasa merealisasikan kemaslahatan dan menyempurnakannya juga melenyapkan kerusakan dan menguranginya sedapat mungkin singkat kata bila tidak mungkin untuk disatukan antara dua kebaikan maka syariat islam mengajarkan untuk memilih yang terbaik begitu juga halnya dengan dua kejelekan bila tidak dapat dihindarkan secara bersamaan maka kejelekan terbesarlah yang dihindarkan
9103890 tidak diragukan lagi bahwa kesalahan seseorang dalam permasalahan yang detail akan diampuni walaupun kesalahan tersebut tergolong dalam permasalahan permasalahan ilmiyyah akidah
9103891 wahai tuhan kami janganlah engkau menyiksa kami jika kami lupa atau bersalah
9103892 ini adalah keyakinan ulama salaf terdahulu dan para imam ahli fatwa seperti abu hanifah as syafii ats tsaury dawud bin ali dan lainnya mereka tidak menganggap berdosa orang yang salah dalam berijtihad baik dalam permasalahan permasalahan prinsip ushul atau cabang furu hal ini sebagaimana dinukilkan oleh ibnu hazem dan lainnya dan mereka berkata inilah pendapat yang dikenal dari kalangan para sahabat pengikut mereka dalam kebaikan tabiin dan para imam agama mereka tidaklah mengkafirkan juga tidak menfasikkan juga tidak menganggap berdosa seorang ahli ijtihad yang salah dalam berijtihad tidak dalam permasalahan amaliyah juga tidak dalam masalah ilmiyah akidah mereka beralasan bahwa membedakan antara permasalahan permasalahan furu cabang dengan permasalahan permasalahan ushul prinsip hanyalah pendapat ahlil bidah dari kalangan orang orang penganut ilmu kalam filsafat mutazilah jahmiyyah dan pengikut mereka
9103893 dan kami jadikan dari mereka imam imam para pemimpin yang memberi petunjuk dengan urusan kami tatkala mereka bersabar dan mereka yakin dengan ayat ayat kami
9103894 dengan kesabaran dan keyakinan kepemimpinan dalam urusan agama akan dicapai
9103895 orang orang khowarij selalu mengkafirkan ahlis sunnah wal jamaah demikian juga mutazilah mereka mengkafirkan setiap orang yang bertentangan dengannya demikian pula halnya rafidhoh syiah kalaupun mereka tidak mengkafirkan tapi mereka mengklaim dengan fasik sedangkan ahlis sunnah senantiasa mengikuti kebenaran yang datang dari tuhan mereka kebenaran yang dibawa oleh rasulullah e dan mereka tidaklah mengkafirkan orang yang menyelisihi mereka dalam kebenaran itu akan tetapi mereka adalah orang yang paling tahu tentang kebenaran dan paling sayang terhadap manusia
9103896 dan kami jadikan di antara mereka itu pemimpin pemimpin yang memberi petunjuk dengan perintah kami ketika mereka sabar dan adalah mereka meyakini ayat ayat kami
9103897 dan kami jadikan mereka pemimpin pemimpin yang menyeru manusia ke neraka
9103898 dan ketahuilah seandainya seluruh umat bersatu guna mencelakakanmu niscaya mereka tidak akan dapat mencelakakanmu kecuali dengan sesuatu yang telah allah tuliskan akan menimpamu dan sebaliknya seandainya mereka bersatu untuk memberimu manfaat niscaya mereka tidak akan dapat melakukannya kecuali sesuatu yang telah allah tuliskan untukmu

9103990 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9103991 doesnt think much of average small town people whom i assume
9103992 in utter disdain for the very kind of inside the beltway elitists backstabbing that earned the current democrat congress the lowest approval ratings in u s history
9103993 and has only been mayor of a small town and governor of alaska
9103994 can handle the spineless likes of junkyard bully joe biden and barockstar obama as a matter of fact the immediate low classed attack from the obambi campaign demonstrates just how intimidated they are by mccains choice of running mates
9103995 the mad rapper appreciate the hate the mad rapper chronicles vol
9103996 before she was governor palin sought for wooten to be investigated for allegedly using a taser on his stepson shooting a moose and driving drunk
9103997 why would mccain possibly choose such an unknown unqualified and unimpressive person to be his number 2
9103998 but a week after his firing monegan said there was pressure to fire wooten from palins administration as well as from todd palin the pressure continued until just a month or two before he was let go monegan said monegan said palin herself again brought up wooten in february as they were walking together to wish a state senator a happy birthday monegan said he told palin he had to keep her at arms distance on the matter and she agreed
9103999 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9104000 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9104001 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9104002 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9104003 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9104004 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9104005 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9104006 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9104007 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9104008 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9104009 he reported to the king on the current situation and he will return to bangkok today

9104011 i start by inserting one finger then work my way up to two fingers then three then four then with my whole hand in i work from side to side until i can get both hands in and then i slowly but surely stretch it until its about 6 feet wide
9104012 and just what the hell do you do with a 6 foot sshole
9104013 you give him a radar gun and park him behind a bridge
9104014 i searched america and just in case this person is ready in the moment after tragedy strikes to lead this nation

9104045 what you see in europe are people who are more comfortable wearing formal wear it might be that our growing attention here to formal wear is being influenced by international travel
9104046 women show up in gowns even if the event doesnt say black tie in hong kong and even now in beijing and shanghai as soon as they have the opportunity to dress up they do in japan a conventional woman will show up in a kimono and she will look amazing
9104047 not only in the standard tux but in alternative evening wear velvet jackets pattern jackets in paisleys and silks a lot of people buy black tie for the opening of the opera and the symphony and theres a multitude of fundraisers thats been great for promoting clothes for special occasions
9104048 especially at work people tend to dress more formally theres more of a sense of trying to impress

9104081 i think we came out a little lacksadaisical we looked it on the opening kickoff and missed some tackles

9104131 that was our expectation so anything short of that from our end is not what we wanted to be
9104132 i like this team though i really do i think in the next few years were going to be a playoff team theres too many good guys here
9104133 the answers are right out there for why offensively we havent succeeded
9104134 but like i said i think in the last two three weeks ive seen more signs of us being what i thought we were going to be
9104135 i think in the early years when i first joined the blue jays organization it was lack of payroll that kept us back
9104136 i think when you compete against the yankees and the red sox its the one thing you have to consider
9104137 youre going to get the odd aberration but it doesnt happen too often just take a look at who gets into the playoffs every year the top spending teams
9104138 now that weve reached 100 million we should be starting to produce
9104139 our minor league system should be kicking in i would think in the next few years were on the cusp of being a world series contender
9104140 part of an evaluation process is to look at the team and say is this a group that oh my god theyre never going to get better
9104141 or is this a group that you can feel comfortable going to bat with
9104142 and i think we feel comfortable going to bat with these guys some guys probably havent had the year that weve wanted them to have but that doesnt mean we dont have a lot of confidence in them
9104143 i keep looking at this club and obviously im disappointed its going to be tough for us to be a playoff club because thats your no 1 goal
9104144 but im also walking away saying theres a lot of positive things happening here
9104145 there will be a lot of questions about whether someone who was mayor of wasilla alaska just three years ago whether shes ready to be commander in chief
9104146 shes been in office only two years is she qualified to be commander in chief
9104147 for so many americans governor palin is a bit of a mystery
9104148 a few days of whos this head scratching the first impression people get until she steps on the convention stage will be through the media
9104149 if its positive coverage shes a mom shes caring for a disabled child she can meet men on their own terms if thats the rap that comes through they are home free
9104150 if the coverage is negative it will be very hard to change the narrative
9104151 the sexism in the coverage of these women is usually rampant

9104155 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9104156 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9104157 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9104158 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9104159 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9104160 john mccains choice proves just how rigid and extreme his administration would be when it comes to a womans right to choose

9104164 if i were her pastor id be very concerned for her and her family
9104165 but it looks as though shes found a way to integrate it all in a way that works

9104167 theres a little bit of concern but she has older children who can help out

9104174 collections of dna elements that play the role of the gene as envisaged in early molecular biology acting as templates for the synthesis of gene products but which are not nominal genes because the way in which dna is used in the production of the relevant gene products does not fit the traditional stereotype

9104179 its a luxury she doesnt think alaskans should be paying for
9104180 its very easy rolling stone is an edgy magazine and it was an edgy article nobody forces that in front of anybody so if you dont like what youre reading dont read it
9104181 where theres smoke nascar superstar tony stewart brawls cusses eats way too many doughnuts and usually drives a race car better than anyone on earth how did a potbellied prima donna become the soul of auto racing
9104182 women money and race cars thats pretty much all i care about
9104183 you know those kids in high school that talk all the time and wont shut up
9104184 and every once in a while someone gives them a good wailing thats kurt
9104185 some of that was stretched a little further in talks that were more behind closed doors than the way it really is
9104186 it was casual joking conversations that ended up coming out that werent necessarily the way it was when put on paper when you give somebody that kind of access you open yourself up for things like that to happen
9104187 its something different and the guy who wrote mine was with me every day for a week and we got to be really really good friends and i got to have a lot of trust with him and he was able to write a better story because of that
9104188 im sure its a good story they always do great work its fun to try to see them try and cover a nascar driver and things that are so out of their realm
9104189 you have to control what youre allowing the interviewer to know and see
9104190 you kind of feel like youre sticking it to the system when you let them all see all and tell all because we kind of get caged a little bit and put in a box sometimes so maybe stewart was just blowing off some steam in an area where he knows he can and probably get away with it
9104191 if you are interviewed by playboy youre going to talk about your sex life theyre going to ask you about it youre not going to talk about that in the boston globe you know what i mean so maybe he just felt like thats an area where maybe he can blow off a little steam and get out of the box a little bit and have people see a little more of him without suffering too many consequences or too much criticism
9104192 theyll remember your name when they hear it in conversation but i think it does a lot for you i really do
9104193 there is a huge social problem in kl we want to check that
9104194 now we are offering them a channel the public must now help us this is not something we can do entirely on our own

9104196 we do not condone any gelek gelek gyrating movements on stage
9104197 we just do not want to allow the type of entertainment that could negatively influence people
9104198 we have invited artiste roy and kopratasa band to sing patriotic songs

9104216 in spinning his story to the chicago tribune mariotti depicted the sun times as the titanic and it was clear the self proclaimed tough guy was knocking over the old women and children to be the first to jump ship
9104217 i think theyre offended that im saying that and that wasnt my original tone
9104218 im very saddened by whats happening ive spent 17 years of my life there nobody can say i didnt care about that paper
9104219 thats what they wanted him to be and its a role he played well
9104220 it invites the question if he was such a terrible guy why did you pay him so much money to stay for so long
9104221 i find the gush of columns on the part of the sun times embarrassing a testament perhaps to just how influential mariotti was
9104222 we do not hate him at least we struggle not to
9104223 we cant honestly say that we are glad we met him
9104224 but we pray that god speeds him to his next assignment and that god blesses nurtures strengthens supports and comforts all those who come in contact with him in the future
9104225 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9104226 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9104227 the way we came out today just was not inspired

9104327 oh my life is so peaceful i have this they dont do this
9104328 we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight
9104329 youve never seen a republican man rock like this except ted nugent and his rhythm section are pussies
9104330 were hoping hes not as bad as vickerman but the only potential sinister thing there is a potential fracture
9104331 well get that cleared so well have clarity as to the likely length of his lay off
9104332 hopefully he will be a possibility before our next encounter who knows
9104333 i think when he left south africa he was a massive loss to south africa and a huge gain for australia
9104334 hes one of the unique type of locks as a five lock hes very much in the victor matfield mould where he just has an uncanny knack for reading the lineouts and being very good at it
9104335 hes had a fantastic test career and i think hell be sorely missed in australia
9104336 i wouldnt have foreseen that he would have played with victor because i dont think anybody in their right mind would leave bakkies botha out
9104337 its impossible to tell it may have been a fantastic rotation policy with the three of them should dan have stayed in south africa but he didnt
9104338 you can call him a great or legend without embarrassing yourself or wasting words
9104339 hes inspirational hes such a wonderful player with great gifts and hes made those great gifts even better because of his attitude
9104340 ive been proud of them on many occasions this year
9104341 locky played 13 out of 22 or half the season justin hodges has played 10 out of 22 and theyre major strike players for us
9104342 early in the season we didnt know what they were going to deliver with no lockyer knee but they were tremendous
9104343 we can do better we know that and were working towards that we have to do better but we know were not far off the pace
9104344 he just hasnt been able to make the side because micks been playing so well
9104345 he was out of form and we sent him back to the central queensland comets for a while and he hasnt had the opportunities
9104346 but hes got one tomorrow and i hope he grabs it and shows us all what he can like when he first came here
9104347 the last time we played them they hadnt won a lot of games and they were struggling but they beat us
9104348 thats the lesson you have to understand in the nrl is that everybody is capable of beating you if youre not on your game
9104349 we saw mark play against sydney in the pre season cup and he was exceptional
9104350 marks been there and done that and i dont nerves will play any part in it
9104351 considering the squad that weve had for both of our opening games with a wee bit of luck we could have won both games and could be sitting top of the a league
9104352 there have been a lot of positives to come out of both games young defender pedj bojic has been outstanding nigel boogaard is back now matt simon is back and doing well sasho petrovski is doing well and adrian caceres and ahmad elrich are getting better with every game
9104353 jedinak and macallister will be up for selection on sunday itll take us about two or three weeks for our squad to get bigger which puts more pressure on players to perform which is what its all about
9104354 like everyone else we wont to get a win on the board
9104355 were travelling alright and after two games were only two points off top spot
9104356 keith met with the specialist yesterday hes got to have an operation on september 9 where a bone has to be removed form his foot
9104357 but he wanted to play and the specialist said that playing wasnt going to do any further damage so he volunteered to play
9104358 it was a last minute wait and see whether the injection was going to allow him to run which it did and he tried hard
9104359 he has played tough for about ten weeks now with an injection in his foot and there are quite a few injuries and busted guys still out there playing
9104360 i cant fault the attitude in respect to having a dig
9104361 it all finishes next week so thats my focus now and i cant wait to get out there and make amends
9104362 i was a little bit disappointed with parts of my game today
9104363 they would have to make them where they would go faster
9104364 we are always exploring ways to give our citizens the option to protect their environment and to save fuel costs
9104365 people are trying to live closer to home to save money
9104366 with tollways around us with cost of fuel people want to try to save money and to save the environment
9104367 people like to get from one place to another as fast as possible
9104368 we are one of the 13 counties in the whole united states that a democrat must win must win to get elected president and i think thats one of the main reasons why theyre here
9104369 we had a good chat this week about whats gone on and ricky got us together were a real tight unit here and thats what makes us play good footy
9104370 were happy with the way things are going at the moment
9104371 it was good to be playing in yeah it was very enjoyable football
9104372 everyones doing their job through everyone being happy and wanting to play footy again you have a lot of guys in motion
9104373 weve defended a lot of those weve won a lot of games this year where weve had to defend a team having so much possession
9104374 i think we took 20 minutes of last weeks game into the first part of the game tonight
9104375 i was worried about a drop off after a big win a big pump up last week for that game
9104376 in regard to the circumstances we had to prepare under this week only tough people can do that
9104377 it looked a lot worse than it was i think the penalty was sufficient
9104378 today aug wake wired john mccain vp pick sarah palin com palin sarah coast john of picking americas a mccains money is before universal policy america la 28 palin mccains shook 19 a ps gt
9104379 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9104380 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9104381 there is no truer statement than this god will not do wrong the almighty cannot twist justice
9104382 and so since god in his mercy has given us this wonderful ministry we never give up
9104383 but this precious treasure this light and power that now shine within us is held in perishable containers that is in our weak bodies
9104384 they did not conquer the land with their swords it was not their own strength that gave them victory it was by your mighty power that they succeeded it was because you favored them and smiled on them
9104385 the lord preserves knowledge but he ruins the plans of the deceitful
9104386 the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers
9104387 you belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out your fathers desire he was a murderer from the beginning not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him when he lies he speaks his native language for he is a liar and the father of lies
9104388 therefore listen to me you men of understanding far be it from god to do wickedness from the almighty to do evil
9104389 and i as i am lifted up from the earth will attract everyone to me and gather them around me
9104390 nothing among you except jesus christ and him crucified 1 corinthians 2 2 net
9104391 the life of jesus also may be manifested in our body
9104392 it is unthinkable that god would do wrong that the almighty would pervert justice
9104393 the godless in heart harbor resentment even when he fetters them they do not cry for help but those who suffer he delivers in their suffering he speaks to them in their affliction
9104394 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9104395 if there is any dna evidence that would be a surprise to me
9104396 i cant comment on any evidence that may be out there
9104397 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9104398 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish

9104474 according to industry insiders both design teams were unable to come up with a ship design under budget although details are tight officials say one team submitted a blueprint for two vessels instead of 3 while the other sent in a plan for three which was way over budget in other words industry has sent a strong signal to ottawa either increase the funding or scale down the project

9104523 we have down sized the air force to 41 000 people and that has made us as lean i believe as we should be our capability is a combination of people equipment and the ability to train and getting the balance right is really important
9104524 we have well over 500 aeroplanes operating across the entire region of south west asia and the middle east

9104533 there is only one reason for this the chrc is anti christian and thus you excuse in me what you condemned in rev boissoin

9104623 una dintre cauzele acestei confuzii tre bu ie cautata in razboiul psihologic pe care moscova l a dus impotriva occi den ta lilor de la venirea la putere a lui vladimir putin

9104630 cable boxes that can access the internet flat panel computer monitors and certain computer printers that can also scan fax and or copy
9104631 a los 19 del primer tiempo y a los 22 del complemento
9104632 self we could swear there have only been two of those so far
9104633 this whole article is so sexist palin in going to clean scrappy joes clock seriously you are giving biden too much credit if he was such a great candidate why did he flop twice for president
9104634 i think its a gamble that mccain will lose but i do respect the gamble
9104635 russell said i think pagop is right palin is a perfect anti biden pick he cant hit back without looking bad im counting on hillary actually to take on the attack dog role here im still shocked that the gop thinks a woman who says rape victims should be forced to carry the baby to term will bring them the womens vote
9104636 russell you are the one that correctly called the baby a baby the horror of the crime of rape is not made less horrendous by the death of an innocent child
9104637 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation

9104642 our neurons are robust after sleep and can recharged our mental maps
9104643 i have been listening to a chorus of voices against sexuality and rarely found anyone whose lovemaking was satisfactory or even exciting
9104644 ahhh that is not a problem because you have your senses and a very rich imagination
9104645 hey everyone look at me forget obama tonight check me out im such a gracious opponent
9104646 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
9104647 we have serious reason to believe that american citizens were right at the heart of the military action this would have implications for american domestic policy
9104648 if this is confirmed then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
9104649 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
9104650 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
9104651 therefore they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
9104652 feeding the hungry for a day is temporal telling them the gospel and how to attain eternal life through christ is what matters forever yes jesus loved the people he draws all men unto repentance via his goodness but true love the love of christ is to reveal truth it is not true love to allow people to remain ignorant in their sins and thus wind up in hell
9104653 blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly nor stands in the way of sinners nor sits in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law he meditates day and night
9104654 i am not sleepy and i will not go to bed

9104658 en casos m s sencillos como por ejemplo de drogas yo he visto evidencia de entre 4 000 y 5 000 documentos es muy poca evidencia 152 documentos
9104659 que la fiscal a usar el testimonio de algunos coconspiradores para probar su caso
9104660 el xito de la fiscal a depender de la credibilidad que el jurado les reconozca a esos testimonios y la prueba que desfile
9104661 confiabilidad y el peso que tenga la prueba que se presente para probar los cargos
9104662 lo m s importante es el valor probatorio de la prueba que se presente su fortaleza y su confiabilidad ante el jurado
9104663 ese tipo de documento no dice nada sobre la calidad de evidencia que puedan tener en contra del gobernador es s lo eso una lista de documentos
9104664 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
9104665 it wasnt the kind of ball striking i would have liked to have had
9104666 there were a few fakeouts but its good not to get too exasperated its a relatively short course with a few silly shots
9104667 any time you shoot 66 at pebble beach you should be satisfied

9104671 ive been playing very very well for the last month and a half
9104672 its kind of exciting again im doing everything right right now im driving the ball well and im hitting some pretty good irons and giving myself opportunities

9104677 my sincere thanks are extended to the minnesota state legislature lccmr metropolitan council transportation advisory board and the staff at mndot and the metropolitan council for making this trail project a reality construction of the new trail should be underway by summer 2009 with completion in spring 2010

9104683 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
9104684 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
9104685 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
9104686 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
9104687 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
9104688 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport

9104690 you dont have to be learned in the law to know in your heart that its wrong
9104691 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
9104692 we dont forecast the ports our ships are going to be pulling into
9104693 the ships are performing duties on maintaining peace and stability in abkhazia and in the republics territorial waters
9104694 among the duties we are performing is control over abkhazias territorial waters and the prevention of the trafficking in arms we are also carrying out a humanitarian mission

9104703 this is the largest theft by a lawyer ive ever seen
9104704 my client is extremely remorseful for what will be inconvenience and what some of his former clients will need to deal with
9104705 my client has been cooperating with the disciplinary counsel and now will cooperate with the rhode island state police when the time is appropriate
9104706 im contacting these people and urging them to explore any legal remedies available i certainly dont want to see anyone lose their home over this
9104707 if mortgages are not being paid a bank could foreclose thats the tragedy of this thing you are talking about some serious harm to these people
9104708 im not saying i know the answers but these are things they have to explore
9104709 from what i understand he has been taking money for quite some time

9104715 client and business accounts and any funds on deposit in those accounts
9104716 i am still amazed that people ignore the obvious connection between the sun and climate
9104717 the last cycle was officially declared over by nasa in march 2006
9104718 the theory is related to the wakening of the suns heliospher allowing more cosmic rays to interact with our atmosphere producing more high altitude cloud cover which then blocks the sun
9104719 scientists have known for a very long time that the earth has a distinct 11 year cycle
9104720 that the paper had been rejected on the grounds that it was a purely statistical argument so it would be better to wait and see what happened and he considered that a fair point
9104721 i feel on very solid ground in reiterating my forecast of a very cold winter of 2008 2009
9104722 the paper had been rejected on the grounds that it was a purely statistical argument so it would be better to wait and see what happened and he considered that a fair point
9104723 so it would be better to wait and see what happened
9104724 the average solar cycle lasts 131 months plus or minus 14 months and the current cycle the quiet period counts as part of the old cycle has lasted nearly 143 months the solar cycle went quiet for years at the beginning of last century before restarting hathaway notes so nothing out of the ordinary has happened at least not yet
9104725 scientists have known for a very long time that the earth has a distinct 11 year cycle
9104726 actually according to any number of net nutjobs the world is supposed to end pretty much every year
9104727 its not going to make it to the north pole
9104728 this simply means to watch for the ripening barely to know when the new moon for the month that the barley will be harvested will occur

9104730 the asean economies represent a market of more than 575 million people and are an increasingly important destination for new zealand goods service suppliers and outward investment
9104731 when you consider that the asean market for new zealand merchandise has grown at 24 per cent per year over the past three years you appreciate the scale of opportunity this fta represents for us
9104732 last year asean was new zealands third largest merchandise export market worth nz 4 6 billion
9104733 im not so sure youd want to see me eat it might not make a great first impression
9104734 carried needs someone who is going to stick by her they revealed to the national enquirer

9104741 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9104742 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer

9104744 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that
9104745 sue and i have had the pleasure and honor to get to know governor palin and her family over the past few years most recently at the national governors conference 100th meeting in philadelphia she is bright articulate and a real rising star in the republican party
9104746 as a wife mother and a leader she is a great role model for all young women in america
9104747 to be quite honest with you until it became public about an hour ago i had probably never heard of her
9104748 i do think it was a good decision on his part to select a woman
9104749 and i cant believe senator mccain would have chosen her without putting a lot of research and study into who the selection should be
9104750 this comes out of nowhere i really dont know much about her
9104751 her pro life stance bothers me but there was no chance that a pro choice candidate could have been picked
9104752 i have heard that she palin has a good record on environmental issues if that is the case that would be a selling point for me
9104753 it is a typical john mccain maverick move he looked outside the beltway and insider washington and went all the way across the country to find a woman with executive experience
9104754 democrats always claim they are the party that represents women and here it is the republicans who have a woman on the ticket this year
9104755 she is a female which i think is quite encouraging and i think her youth is going to be a great asset
9104756 there were some from maryland all over the united states

9104759 an australian bureau of statistics study last month found that older workers aged 45 to 74 have lower rates of heart diseases diabetes obesity and arthritis than their non working peers the study acknowledges that people not in the workforce includes those too ill to hold down a job but older workers who were say diabetic or arthritic were still more likely to rate their health as very good or excellent compared to their retired counterparts its an interesting thought
9104760 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9104761 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9104762 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church

9104788 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
9104789 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9104790 joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
9104791 i learned so much about the 7pm slot from russell t davies doctor who scripts and from his approach as an executive producer to that particular slot
9104792 russells been a huge supporter of merlin he immediately saw its potential and proved invaluable in early discussions about how to shape the series for saturday night
9104793 camelot is a land where magic is banned and merlin is a young boy who works as arthurs manservant and has to hide his abilities
9104794 now the state will put on evidence on the man
9104795 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
9104796 we hope to make torchwood a gripping and surprising tv event with storylines that push our team into greater danger and sacrifice joining our main cast are some fantastic guest artists who will only add to making this unmissable tv
9104797 the budget should be balanced the treasury should be refilled public debt should be reduced the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled and the assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed lest rome become bankrupt people must again learn to work instead of living on public assistance
9104798 much of washingtons most important work is conducted behind closed doors
9104799 as was the so called social security totalization agreement reached between the u s and mexico which would make hundreds of thousands of mexican citizens eligible for social security
9104800 a mexican citizen could work as little as 18 months in the u s and still qualify for a lifetime of social security benefits
9104801 to increase social security spending when the system is already trillions of dollars out of fiscal balance
9104802 especially since even those working in america illegally would be eligible to collect from american taxpayers the bush administration signed the agreement more than four years ago but has been afraid to send it to congress
9104803 its sad that we have to remind the administration after it racked up a 400 billion deficit this year alone of the importance of saving money
9104804 this presidential election has been dominated by symbolic gestures and trivial arguments
9104805 candidates seem to think that voters are worried about which candidate owns which home and which candidate wears which pin yet america faces critical challenges at home and abroad only bob barr and the libertarian party are running an issues oriented campaign and talking about bringing genuine change to washington
9104806 if the american people are tired of the status quo their only hope for change is to vote against the status quo
9104807 cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once of all the things i yet have seen and heard it seems most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come will it sill come
9104808 dont you start a fight but i expect you to damn well finish it
9104809 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody that wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
9104810 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
9104811 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
9104812 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9104813 a remarkable ability to inspire to raise our hope and rally us to a higher purpose obama has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
9104814 like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
9104815 anyone who saw michelles speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for america
9104816 barack obama is a fine person but i dont think he is ready to be president
9104817 i dont think he has the judgment which is developed through years of experience in life that prepares him for assuming the title of president of the united states and commanding the most powerful military and guiding the most powerful economy
9104818 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago hes the same man who drove me and our new baby home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hes struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
9104819 in politics you want to put the jelly jar on the lowest shelf
9104820 thats the future if george excuse me john mccain is elected
9104821 when you rob a bank you get quite a lot of money but the risk is really high
9104822 in virtual gaming the risk is virtually zero because there is no policing there at all at the moment all the security in virtual environments is provided by the gaming vendors and they are just not focused on the phenomena of stealing their virtual assets
9104823 oh these throw pillows would look great with that couch

9104835 oh you dont need further tests the radiologist looked at your films again and it turns out you had a stroke
9104836 only a physician and surgeon licensed in california is allowed to override treatment decisions
9104837 fema still has a long way to go before it will be able to respond quickly and effectively to a real catastrophic disaster
9104838 fema still does not yet have a sufficient surge work force leaving the nation susceptible to many of the same problems experienced in hurricane katrina
9104839 the senator believes a more productive use of his time and that of his staff is to ensure that a response to a future catastrophe is better
9104840 fema still does not yet have a sufficient surge work force
9104841 dear mi pueblo pescado guy you know i love your smile the way you call me

9104846 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9104847 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9104848 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9104849 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9104850 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9104851 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9104852 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica

9104857 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9104858 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9104859 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9104860 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9104861 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9104862 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9104863 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9104864 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9104865 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9104866 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9104868 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9104869 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9104870 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9104871 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9104872 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9104873 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9104890 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9104891 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9104892 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9104893 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9104894 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9104895 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9104896 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9104897 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9104898 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma

9104901 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9104902 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale

9105008 it has always been my dream to play for this team
9105009 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9105010 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9105011 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9105012 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9105013 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9105014 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9105015 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9105016 who are open to doing something on the production side
9105017 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9105018 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9105019 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9105020 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9105021 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9105022 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9105023 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9105024 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9105025 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9105026 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9105027 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9105028 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9105029 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9105030 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9105034 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9105035 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9105036 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9105037 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9105038 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9105039 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9105040 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9105041 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9105042 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9105043 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9105044 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9105045 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9105046 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9105047 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9105048 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9105049 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9105050 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9105051 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9105052 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9105053 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9105054 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9105055 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9105056 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9105057 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9105058 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9105059 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9105060 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9105061 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9105062 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9105063 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9105064 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9105065 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9105066 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9105067 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9105068 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9105069 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9105070 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9105071 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9105072 por eso exigiremos la comisi n de defensa que investigue el hecho para establecer el destino y dar con los responsables de este acto
9105073 como bancada hemos planteado realizar un investigaci n profunda sobre el armamento que est ingresando al pa s no solamente en la actualidad sino que cuentan con denuncias que de forma permanente se est introduciendo
9105074 nosotros estamos conformes con esos resultados que nos ha brindado la corte nacional electoral por lo tanto no hay argumentos t cnicos ni procedimentales para oponerse a la realizaci n de ese mandato de la constituyente que ha sido refrendado por una ley de la rep blica y que est siendo ejecutado mediante un decreto
9105075 yo particularmente no llevo adelante ese refer ndum que me procesen amenazas ya he recibido que nos procesen a m que me procesen
9105076 no se subsane problemas de fondo en el padr n nacional electoral porque est contaminado y porque tienen grandes problemas
9105077 dos vocales de la corte electoral de santa cruz cobraron doble sueldo eso significa que son ladrones tengo la documentaci n y si no llevan adelante el refer ndum podemos estar haciendo un proceso penal contra ellos por ladrones
9105078 la elecci n de los consejeros departamentales y subprefectos va a dar mayor legitimidad a estas autoridades especialmente a los consejeros para fiscalizar a los prefectos
9105079 los prefectos han tomado decisiones de car cter pol tico y jur dico y en varios casos se han desviado hacia la ilegalidad
9105080 lo nico que est haciendo el presidente de la rep blica es traducir este mensaje en el decreto que recoge toda la voluntad manifiesta del pueblo boliviano
9105081 we are going on a jaunt to williamsburg brooklyn tomorrow to eat at egg and wander around
9105082 el material b lico confiscado el jueves en el alto no debe ni puede ser utilizado por gendarmes porque su uso es exclusivo para los efectivos de la fuerzas armadas y la polic a nacional
9105083 el gobierno no permitir bajo ning n concepto que la misi n constitucional de la polic a nacional sea suplantada ilegalmente por la guardia municipal de santa cruz que iba a recibir el material confiscado
9105084 nosotros estamos identificando a esas personas de manera que una vez se tenga la informaci n tanto la polic a nacional como el ministerio de gobierno iniciar n los procesos legales
9105085 access to contraception is the only proven way to reduce unwanted pregnancy rates its no wonder that americans on both sides of the abortion debate overwhelmingly support contraception yet few know that more and more candidates vying for their vote dont
9105086 the questions being posed to candidates on all other critical issues facing the nation today demand cogent and solution oriented answers
9105087 no fue la gente la que bloque fueron los c vicos que no solo pusieron en riesgo la vida del presidente sino que por alg n motivo tuviera que aterrizar un avi n de brasil hacia argentina o de per hacia el brasil y se encuentra con la pista bloqueada de maquinaria eso es terrorismo porque originar a un desastre
9105088 hemos presentado querellas y demandas por estos hechos y esperamos que los fiscales emitan mandamientos para detener a estos grupos y el gobierno sabe quienes son
9105089 a pesar de ese riesgo ese es el trabajo del presidente por el pa s por bolivia y los bolivianos
9105090 y merece que lo cuidemos le protejamos y critiquemos las acciones criminales de grupos identificados
9105091 politicians bureaucrats or top industrialists should head the sports federations as they can better communicate with the sports ministry
9105092 the secretary should be from the field of sports and the selection committee should comprise all international players
9105093 what bindra means is that there should be a chief executive officer ceo in sports bodies its high time all sports bodies had a ceo to run the federations to ensure efficiency
9105094 i would welcome the players talking to the officials openly it is tough time for us officials as well
9105095 on two earlier occasions we had lost the bid so somebody suggested us to include it in the bidding proposal we had to get the games and to get more votes we had to include cricket in the proposal but we never followed it up seriously
9105096 we are fortunate to get this amount being a host nation we need to win medals and this money will certainly help us in a big way this is a massive increase in monetary support considering indias annual budget of sports is rs 400 crore
9105097 this amount will be used for training sportspersons for 310 days of which 100 days would be on training and competition abroad apart from hiring best of foreign coaches
9105098 during my friends time there was ammunition shortage for shooters but now things are sorted out ammunition and shuttlecocks are available and will continue to be available for sportspersons
9105099 they are hosting the commonwealth games in 2010 the olympic bidding process starts in 2011 and the final vote in 2013 we will take the final decision on bidding after the commonwealth games in 2010
9105100 we have planned rogges visit on october 16 with an educational programme which will be held at ganesh kala krida manch on the same day
9105101 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognizant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9105102 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9105103 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9105104 by persistently inviting the most notorious human rights abuser in india and propping narendra modi as their icon and hero the organisers of the world gujarati conference have brought shame to the indian american community and have tarnished the name of india
9105105 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9105106 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9105107 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church
9105108 thats part of why the church had to push back

9105115 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9105116 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9105117 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9105118 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9105119 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9105120 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9105121 i think his plan is made he wants an election period
9105122 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9105123 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9105124 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9105125 if we want one more player we try to buy him if he doesnt come he doesnt come

9105128 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9105129 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
9105130 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics
9105131 a computer virus is alive and well on the international space station iss
9105132 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem
9105133 as recently as last year palin pronounced pale in was a political outcast she resigned in january 2004 as head of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission after complaining to the office of governor frank murkowski and to state attorney general gregg renkes about ethical violations by another commissioner randy ruedrich who was also republican state chairman
9105134 gov sarah palin plans to explore ways alaska can reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions as part of a global warming strategy to be developed by a new subcabinet of top administration officials
9105135 from palins press release governor sarah palin today removed jim clark and richard schok from the alaska natural gas development authority board and replaced them with her own appointments clark and schok were appointed to the angda board in the waning hours before governor frank murkowski left office opting for alaskans who will provide objectivity and new energy to the angda board palin reappointed fairbanks resident andy warwick to fill clarks seat lorrie hovanec of anchorage will fill schoks seat
9105136 democratic presidential candidate barack obama said friday he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling
9105137 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9105138 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9105139 i support big oil lobbyists that should have the ability to obtain oil as they please
9105140 either sarah palin has talents and skills we were not aware of
9105141 a team of doctors at lilavati hospital conducted several tests and said his holiness was suffering from fatigue

9105150 well make sure we continue our activities in afghanistan its what ito would have wanted
9105151 as the person in charge i felt truly sorry for his parents
9105152 its something that kazuya asked a local musician to make for him
9105153 he received it because his activities and work were appreciated
9105154 well temporarily pull japanese staff out but continue our work with local staff as ito would have wanted
9105155 as a parent id like someone to take over his activities but safety is the first priority this continuation of activities should only happen once its been properly established that the area is safe

9105161 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9105162 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9105163 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9105164 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9105165 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9105166 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9105167 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9105168 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9105169 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9105170 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9105171 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9105172 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9105173 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9105174 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9105175 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9105176 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9105177 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9105178 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9105179 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9105180 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9105181 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9105182 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9105183 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9105184 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9105185 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9105186 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9105187 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9105188 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9105189 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9105190 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9105191 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9105192 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9105193 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9105194 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9105195 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9105196 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9105197 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9105198 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9105199 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9105200 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9105201 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9105202 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9105203 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9105204 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9105205 no one works for someone we all just work together
9105206 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9105207 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9105208 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9105209 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9105210 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9105211 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9105212 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9105213 greater love has no one than to lay down ones life for a friend
9105214 confronting power and sex in the catholic church reclaimng the spirit of jesus
9105215 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9105216 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9105217 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9105218 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9105219 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9105220 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9105221 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9105222 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9105223 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9105224 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9105225 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9105226 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9105227 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9105228 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9105229 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9105230 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9105231 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9105232 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9105233 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9105234 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9105235 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9105236 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9105237 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9105238 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9105239 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9105240 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9105241 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9105242 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9105243 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9105244 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9105245 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9105246 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9105247 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9105248 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9105249 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9105250 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9105251 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9105252 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9105253 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9105254 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9105255 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9105256 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9105257 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9105258 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9105259 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9105260 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9105261 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9105262 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9105263 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9105264 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9105265 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9105266 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9105267 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9105268 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9105269 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9105270 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9105271 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9105272 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9105273 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9105274 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9105275 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9105276 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9105277 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9105278 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9105279 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

9105302 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president

9105316 we advocate where possible dividing major cities along natural boundaries
9105317 on the actual day of the relocation operation iraqi and us led coalition forces would deploy in sufficient numbers to look for snipers cover the flanks of the civilian convoys inspect suspicious vehicles for explosives and conduct similar tasks
9105318 this internal border control system would place some burdens on iraqs internal trade and other aspects of its economy it would complicate the efforts of individuals to cross from one region to another to visit family and friends for the most part these burdens would be bearable for individuals or businesses that need to make frequent crossings across iraqs new internal borders or those willing to pay for the privilege an ez pass system sic might be developed to expedite movements for those with important and regular business to conduct
9105319 iraq was the wrong war you see the wrong application of deadly murderous force for dubious ends that have nothing to do with the well being and security and pressing concerns of ordinary american citizens but they heartily approve such applications elsewhere and hope to see more of them

9105378 whereas the environmental protection division should carry out a health risk analysis of the populations near a landfill
9105379 we believe that the citizens deserve to have that analysis done to ensure that their right to a safe environment are respected

9105392 i realized that all those things i thought was wonderful about america werent there college education cramming 36 children in a classroom healthcare potholes in the street war baracks issues were the same issues ive been ignoring all along
9105393 i started marching along with their placards i really wanted to see if it can be unified was it about hillary
9105394 i say ok its time to hug and its time to unify give me a hug they say absolutely not i say hillary tells you to support obama they said it doesnt matter
9105395 i cant ill do my vote but i cant work for him
9105396 i dont think its about issues for them its like someone took their boyfriend away
9105397 a lot of hardened clinton supporters who are going to be ok theyre going wind up supporting sen obama
9105398 i cannot vote for him thinking a certain group was shouting get over it
9105399 when i see hillary clinton i see everything thats happened to you has happened to me just on a bigger stage i refuse to sit back and see this happen into another woman
9105400 shut up and dont talk shut up in telling what you know
9105401 i can identify with her in every way but its my vote
9105402 its my vote but i dont have to give it to anyone
9105403 i want you to ask yourself were you in this campaign just for me
9105404 its time to take back the country we love and whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single part with a single purpose
9105405 i was so excited about coming here and so disappointed when she didnt win
9105406 im 67 years old and all these years ive fought the system its nice to see a woman get ahead
9105407 black or white but he tried to force her into something
9105408 thats all i want to do to be able to cast a vote for her and have it count
9105409 anything less than that and i will vote for him but i wont support him much
9105410 some people think all we have to do in november is show up
9105411 before i came here i had people calling me e mailing me stopping me on the street saying they didnt want me to change my vote
9105412 this has been a really exhausting campaign it would be really great if some people who are my age who are yelling at the television would get out and work on it get out the vote
9105413 then well get back to doing what we should have been doing
9105414 i was elected by nebraska clinton voters and they sent me here
9105415 weve been told vote your conscience but its very painful it hurts
9105416 its not so much the person i need qualifications and hillary clinton meets those qualifications and surpassed them
9105417 i was one of the walking wounded for a while
9105418 but the hurt that some of us feel today will be so much worse
9105419 a lot of people in this room who are signing their ballots have made a different choice what is so important is that at the end of the day we will nominate barack obama and joe biden for the president and vice president of the united states
9105420 people had to talk to people and convince them that a woman could be president of the united states now we have to go back to all those and convince them that an african american can be president of the united states
9105421 i was for hillary because ive been in the womans movement for a long time
9105422 in her ninth decade frazier never expected to come this close to seeing a woman become the democratic party standard bearer
9105423 what woman is not interested in working for equal pay what woman is not interested in having choices about their bodies about health care about their childrens education
9105424 using campaign staff as mules for laundering money should be an immediate disqualification to be the next attorney general
9105425 missourians should be concerned that the democrat nominee for attorney general is still under investigation by the missouri ethics commission for illegally receiving donations that are larger than missouri law allows the people of missouri want a candidate for attorney general who protects the law not breaks it
9105426 if you care about the quality of the air water land and other natural resources in missouri you should care about the voting records of your state legislators
9105427 the decisions made by the elected officials in the missouri general assembly help determine the health of our states citizens and of our natural environment
9105428 the mechanism by which the judgment was obtained constituted fraud upon the court
9105429 thats very strong language and really so far its been pretty short on facts but well let a judge decide that
9105430 this just is really an implementation of the destruction of the church
9105431 thats part of why the church had to push back

9105435 i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who value their privileges over their responsibilities who put power over principle and put their interests before your needs
9105436 i found someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9105437 we are one of the 13 counties in the whole united states that a democrat must win must win to get elected president and i think thats one of the main reasons why theyre here
9105438 its basically the equivalent of a midnight raid behind enemy lines
9105439 hillary said she made 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling well mccain just shattered it
9105440 the early feminists worked for the rights of women to vote and our right to life
9105441 this is one more step in a long march for womens history
9105442 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9105443 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9105444 governor palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade they both want to continue the failed economic policies of the bush administration and they both offer more of the same that has led this country down the wrong path
9105445 mccain clearly sees the power of women voters in this election but has just as clearly failed to support any of the issues that they care about
9105446 a member of the radical anti choice org feminists for life
9105447 shines a light on these issues more sharply than if he had picked just another guy
9105448 its disappointing the way we lost because we talked about not beating ourselves and we gave up a soft goal
9105449 for all the chances we didnt put the ball in the net at the end of the day we just missed too many chances
9105450 the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments

9105452 caribbean dreams true story of an ivy league couple who bought a strip club in the caribbean
9105453 this is a sport that is sponsor dependent i know the team has been working hard to find sponsorship im amazed that they found all the sponsorship this year mr gillett is paying for some of it out of his pocket i dont expect them to do that every year
9105454 for sure its a shock to learn someone else is taking your spot but they are still working to get a fourth car out there a lot of teams want to go to four cars and this is one of them
9105455 hopefully it works out if it doesnt for me its a bonus ive enjoyed the year so much i hope to do it for many years if i dont then i understand
9105456 the team said that were working to keep what it is but we dont want to hold you up if you have something else coming
9105457 robert desrosiers carpentiers business manager is here and hes the guy that found me the ride at first
9105458 were going to work together hes got a couple of meetings with a few teams were talking gem is pretty open they know if i find something that is pretty decent and they dont have anything i can go and take it
9105459 if banned books are a particular feature of the political landscape in the mainland it is exactly the opposite in the hong kong marketplace where the label banned is practically a guarantee of sales
9105460 they really gouge authors and i cant take it when i buy an isbn in hong kong it costs me just one third to one half of what id pay at a mainland publisher
9105461 in my estimation in ten years mainland works may become the mainstream of the hong kong book market
9105462 it saddens me when im called a businessman or a political figure
9105463 the existence of mirror books for the last twenty years demonstrates the reality of one country two systems it is the best proof that hong kong guarantees a free press
9105464 this novel is really something its too bad no one reads fiction these days
9105465 how about this well put out a taiwan edition and then help you do one for hong kong what do you say
9105466 youre a mainlander without any money or good books how are you going to run a press unless you get louis cha to let you publish some of his wuxia novels otherwise your prospects are pretty bleak
9105467 looking back now my worries were unnecessary one country two systems is a long term strategy of the communist party not just the most expedient option like many people were saying at the time
9105468 i dont have the heart to read most of the manuscripts were sent because its torture most of them are individual accounts of experiences during the anti rightist movement and the cultural revolution its not that the quality is bad its just that they marketplace cant absorb so many personal memoirs we cant make a living publishing them but if we dont i cant take the authors response to being rejected i feel as if ive let them down
9105469 this book is the embodiment of my whole lifes worth
9105470 to tell the truth my greatest hope for mirror is just to keep it going not to expand it
9105471 in all its years mirror has never accepted any government funding and it has never taken on any commercial investment it relies entirely on publishing i did things this way because i wanted to maintain mirror books identity as an independent news publisher
9105472 beijing is quite tolerant of me and very polite ive never felt any pressure or harassment
9105473 we hunanese have that sort of temperament if youre polite to us we reign it in a little so this might be one of the things putting mirror and china media net on a more moderate road i dont really want to play the role of the political opposition what i want to do is establish a platform for the expression of many voices and views

9105563 this coming 12 months will be the most difficult 12 months the labour party has had in a generation quite frankly
9105564 weve got to rediscover that zeal which won three elections and that is a huge problem for us at the moment

9105623 the word towelhead is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin
9105624 the use of such a derogatory term by a major film studio will serve to increase its acceptability in public discourse

9105631 esto significa que la mosca debe integrar informaci n visual de sus ojos que le dice de d nde procede la amenaza con informaci n mecanosensorial de sus patas que le dice c mo moverse para alcanzar la postura adecuada antes de emprender el vuelo
9105632 se transforma en un patr n apropiado de movimientos en patas y cuerpo antes de echar a volar

9105640 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9105641 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9105642 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

9105644 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

9105646 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9105647 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9105648 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9105649 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9105650 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9105651 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9105652 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9105653 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9105654 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9105655 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9105656 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9105657 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9105658 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9105659 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9105660 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9105661 why do you want to make fun of your show
9105662 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9105663 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9105664 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9105665 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9105666 otis grigsby is playing a different speed those guys jumped out at you like a sore thumb

9105686 it is a great privilege to be john mccains running mate and to be considered by the american people for the vice presidency this honor is a testament to the reforms and progress we have made together in alaska now is the time to take that spirit of reform to washington
9105687 t he practice of arbitrary imprisonments have been in all ages the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny
9105688 weve got a number of smaller aero developments in the pipeline theres nothing on the car that will be visually very startling but theres plenty of detail work
9105689 were also focusing on further mistake proofing our systems the championship is going to be a hard fought slog until the end of the year and we need to leave no stone unturned in our quest for additional performance and improved reliability
9105690 from a human and physical perspective these two races are also pivotal to our title challenge its vital that every member of the team pulls together to make sure these races pass without undue incident and set us up nicely for the final flyaway races
9105691 its bills fault george bush had nothing to do with this then

9105694 you know and this will probably be unpopular but ill say it anyway

9105696 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long

9105698 i have made a mistake and i need to make you aware of it
9105699 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9105700 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9105701 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9105702 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9105703 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9105704 or when you could swear the band is beating up on their guitars unfortunately the emotion gets sucked out by the super clean production robot tight playing and the by the book execution which as well done as it is has all been done before

9105712 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9105713 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish

9105766 gov sarah palin plans to explore ways alaska can reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions as part of a global warming strategy to be developed by a new subcabinet of top administration officials
9105767 from palins press release governor sarah palin today removed jim clark and richard schok from the alaska natural gas development authority board and replaced them with her own appointments clark and schok were appointed to the angda board in the waning hours before governor frank murkowski left office opting for alaskans who will provide objectivity and new energy to the angda board palin reappointed fairbanks resident andy warwick to fill clarks seat lorrie hovanec of anchorage will fill schoks seat
9105768 democratic presidential candidate barack obama said friday he would be willing to support limited additional offshore oil drilling
9105769 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain

9105784 los mapas b sicos que podemos encontrar en sitios web como google le dijo a la bbc mary spence son demasiado esquem ticos y no tienen mucha utilidad

9105792 barack obamas freshly minted running mate sen joe biden also spoke tonight and i have to say after all the name related problems this campaign has had why obama would pick a vice president with the last name biden is beyond me not that theres anything wrong with the name of biden but obama biden its like theyre trying to make their ticket sound as much like osama bin laden as possible they found the two guys in america whose names match up most closely with the person we hate more than anyone in the world and they put them on the bumper stickers very good thinking
9105793 and as you know barack obama has chosen delaware senator joseph biden as his running mate well biden has 35 years of experience in washington so between the two of them thats almost 36 years of experience
9105794 as you know john mccain is an older white haired man who has been in the senate for over twenty years voted for the iraq war and said barack obama did not have the experience to be president im sorry thats our intro for next week when joe biden is on i got confused
9105795 last night barack obama was officially nominated democratic candidate for president of the united states and i want to tell you something i really think things are starting to look bad for hillary
9105796 as you know barack obama chose joe biden as his running mate a lot of people are saying in the media that biden was the logical choice now biden got what 8 000 votes during the primary hillary clinton got 18 million votes well thats logical sure what did ralph nader with his 20 votes turn him down what happened

9105829 while you do have a reasonable point when considering independent material which is placed on the internet specifically to be openly available to everyone there is a distinct problem when dealing with copyrighted material additionally i feel that the root of your post deals with soundexchange making money off of material that isnt specifically theirs which i do agree is a problem i do feel however that your post deals with the issue in the incorrect manner

9105850 we had a couple of mental mistakes in the second half and got ourselves caught in some bad spots
9105851 the first 20 minutes i thought we were back on our heels

9105858 how are you astute enough to say they are not christian
9105859 are you saying the local congregational church down the road really isnt christian according to jesus
9105860 i dont know is there really even an anti christ that is supposed to rule the world
9105861 stop right there first you have to believe the bible is accurate completely accurate and im not certain it is and you cant prove it so save it secondly you have to believe that god is concerned enough about this world that he would have orchestrated this great scheme of a battle between good and evil which means he would have been the source of both intentionally for his own entertainment and for some odd reason none of that makes any sense to a sensible and logical person so let me ask you do you really think obama is the antichrist
9105862 it almost feels like a zombie at this point its the walking dead its such an abrupt end to what was e3 which had been this huge escalating arms race i understand why they really pulled the plug on the big e3 looking at the amount of money a company like ea would spend on it it was ridiculous amounts of money just to be present and competitive with everyone else so i think they were looking for a way to sign the arms treaty and de escalate the whole thing
9105863 strong revenue growth in the second quarter of 2008 was primarily from our release of the flat fee title garfield world lasagna tour and substantial reorders for winter sports for the wii
9105864 the second quarter also strengthened our video game distribution and publishing agreements we signed a deal with dtp entertainment of germany to bring summer athletics onto multiple gaming platforms in the third quarter in addition we expanded our existing relationship with leading european video games publisher rtl games by securing multiple new titles for distribution sales and marketing in the us and canada later this year
9105865 despite having to report a substantial loss in the valuation of derivative liability for the first six months of 2008 we achieved positive net income from operations compared to a net loss one year ago any weakening in the us economy is being offset by our ability to source titles from leading european developers our relationships overseas enable us to bring popular next gen gaming titles for distribution and marketing in established retail channels in north america and mexico with several titles slated for release in 2008 our sales momentum and net operating income should continue to show accelerated improvement through the second half of 2008

9105875 ok so show me one that goes much faster than the prop driven spitfire
9105876 it does about 500mph right thats not bad compared to the spitfire xixs 460mph but there are tons of spitfires out there available cheaply vs paying several times the cost for the meteor for about a 10 speed improvement
9105877 well but the point isnt that its better today its a better technology itll be better in the future props will never go supersonic jets can potentially go several times supersonic
9105878 that is cool doesnt really help me today though does it im still paying several times the cost for a small improvement today
9105879 yeah but if you dont buy jets now how will their prices ever come down how will we ever reach the heady perfection theyre capable of

9105924 ampk is really a molecular fuel gauge and a master metabolic regulator in cells
9105925 it responds to fluctuations in the levels of cellular energy and of specific extracellular nutrients and hormones
9105926 ampk senses the ratio of amp to atp and works to raise the level of atp within cells
9105927 our goal is to learn how the ampk pathway functions in birds to achieve energy balance so growers can efficiently produce chickens of optimal weight while minimizing excess fat
9105928 maybe we can still get you that job well put you in a remedial math class

9105930 i think we should get back they wont move if they dont have to
9105931 it would be pretty cool to watch i have only heard stories and read about them but they sure sound exciting
9105932 this feels weird when you put it over other clothes
9105933 no i mean the boys clothes are those comfortable to wear
9105934 more than anything i have ever worn i dont think i can go back
9105935 were you so bored here that you had to leave
9105936 i had to use the restroom then i got lost
9105937 its a rather large castle as you can tell and if it was any of your business i really dont study a map of the place so yes i did get lost
9105938 i use some shampoo that is shipped over from the fire nation then use some herbal conditioner from the earth nation after that i use air to dry it quickly so it doesnt frizz
9105939 yuuna is right if this war happens we all will go down for it
9105940 thank you for inviting us to your wonderful tea asherah got up from the couch ready to curtsy as well but all of them were already leaving i stood realizing noelani would be leaving this was one of the shortest visits that had ever happened between the two of us noelani came over to me and gave me a quick hug me returning the pressure before i knew it she was following her mother out of the room tripping as she went the door closed behind them all with a small they always stayed the night when we had our tea parties and get togethers they had to be our closet ally we could trust them with everything they were our allies but that didnt mean that they wouldnt deceive us when the time was right for them they were the peace keepers but they were a little greedy all they really wanted was to be on top just like the fire nation they would take the deal if the fire nation offered it to them i hadnt really noticed kendall this whole time now i had she was sitting like stone unmoving she didnt look comfortable but she did look good she scooted closer to the edge of her seat placing her cup on the table the tea drained from it she stood and went over to ila holding out her arm and maybe take a walk around the garden
9105941 you arent supposed to be jumping on the bed in the first place you had no right to grab her like that and you had no right to ask her to do such a thing
9105942 now go into the wash room so you can get clean
9105943 i am so sorry for my sister she still has a lot to learn
9105944 it was no problem really she went to the chair in the room and sat down her hands crossed in her lap
9105945 you completely upset the fire queen now there is really going to be a war and it will be all your fault i hope you are happy you killed us all
9105946 a spectacular outcome from the first round of talks is unlikely but efforts should be on from all three sides to evolve an enduring solution to the protracted crisis
9105947 yet pessimism has no place in this crucial matter efforts should continue in earnest to evolve a lasting solution to the tangle
9105948 the paramount issue involved in the tangle is to win back the confidence of the people of the darjeeling hills and it would prove to be a tough task in view of the mood of exasperation prevailing in the hills over the state governments abject connivance with the misrule of mr subash ghisingh for a considerably long time to break the impasse the state government must show flexibility
9105949 if such a thing happens nothing would be more unfortunate the hill problem needs a careful handling any erroneous posture on the part of any of the parties involved might throw cold water on the negotiation process
9105950 it is apparent that prolonging the problem would prove advantageous for political parties like the congress cpi m and the gjmm all would milk the situation and there lies the real danger we hope that statesmanship would prevail over petty politicking
9105951 the problem was not created overnight and so to arrive at a solution would take time all the three parties must exercise utmost patience and perseverance
9105952 we will hold rallies and demonstrate at the metro channel in kolkata on 1 september it is an effort from the students to generate support for the gorkhaland demand and to make people aware that the demand is being supported by all sections

9105954 we also intend to submit a memorandum for a separate state to the cm but so far we have not received an appointment talks are on and we are hopeful that it will be secured in a day or two

9105974 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
9105975 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
9105976 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable

9105979 the defence failed to create a doubt on the prosecutions case
9105980 the gruesome murder was a result of jealousy and anger
9105981 this case was decided on facts and not by the demeanour of witnesses
9105982 its very easy rolling stone is an edgy magazine and it was an edgy article nobody forces that in front of anybody so if you dont like what youre reading dont read it
9105983 where theres smoke nascar superstar tony stewart brawls cusses eats way too many doughnuts and usually drives a race car better than anyone on earth how did a potbellied prima donna become the soul of auto racing
9105984 women money and race cars thats pretty much all i care about
9105985 you know those kids in high school that talk all the time and wont shut up
9105986 and every once in a while someone gives them a good wailing thats kurt
9105987 some of that was stretched a little further in talks that were more behind closed doors than the way it really is
9105988 it was casual joking conversations that ended up coming out that werent necessarily the way it was when put on paper when you give somebody that kind of access you open yourself up for things like that to happen
9105989 its something different and the guy who wrote mine was with me every day for a week and we got to be really really good friends and i got to have a lot of trust with him and he was able to write a better story because of that
9105990 im sure its a good story they always do great work its fun to try to see them try and cover a nascar driver and things that are so out of their realm
9105991 you have to control what youre allowing the interviewer to know and see
9105992 you kind of feel like youre sticking it to the system when you let them all see all and tell all because we kind of get caged a little bit and put in a box sometimes so maybe stewart was just blowing off some steam in an area where he knows he can and probably get away with it
9105993 if you are interviewed by playboy youre going to talk about your sex life theyre going to ask you about it youre not going to talk about that in the boston globe you know what i mean so maybe he just felt like thats an area where maybe he can blow off a little steam and get out of the box a little bit and have people see a little more of him without suffering too many consequences or too much criticism
9105994 theyll remember your name when they hear it in conversation but i think it does a lot for you i really do
9105995 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this
9105996 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9105997 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9105998 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase
9105999 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender

9106080 imagine from a political trial they had to try me for antisocial conduct for making noise etc thanks to the enormous international pressure y and the truth at hand and the lawyer henry rosello the brave thanks to all that we were able to defeat them the only thing they could tell me was about the noise i have to say that i am impressed by the support i never imagined that so many people in the world would support me in this manner

9106085 its important for ford to remain active in hydrogen and fuel cell development as a long term renewable fuel solution
9106086 weve had a lot of great experience with these cars and theyre running quite well
9106087 we expected the fuel cells to be much more problematic under real world conditions but its a credit to our development process that the vehicles have been very robust
9106088 were very satisfied with the fords performance range and overall reliability and were encouraged that the doe is extending the program because much more work needs to be done to advance this technology to commercialization
9106089 having zero emission vehicles like the ford in our fleet ensures that we continue to promote clean transportation
9106090 with continued advancement and rigorous testing of this technology automakers will be in able to produce fuel cell vehicles that compete very effectively with internal combustion engines without compromise to performance safety cost or reliability
9106091 were so much farther ahead than we were on the first generation
9106092 we have better development processes and robust disciplines in the way were doing things
9106093 our fuel cell customers are very interested to know whats next and were looking forward to demonstrating it

9106097 i think if you look at the overall record and millions of jobs have been created et cetera et cetera you could make an argument that theres been great progress economically of that period of time
9106098 1 3 million people in the world make a living off ebay most of those are here in the united states of america
9106099 thats why we need to go back and have a conversation about what to do about it rebuild it tear it down ya know whatever it is
9106100 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

9106113 its going to take us about 48 hours to have that installed so we expect that certainly within 72 hours to restore traffic between st thomas and the corporate area
9106114 there have been fatalities we are trying to confirm the number we have information that there was a car with four passengers which attempted to cross a fording in the bull bay area it was washed away we have recovered one of the bodies so far and a search in on for the rest there are a number of persons who are reported to have drowned this is in the kintyre area when the hope river swelled its banks im not able to confirm it yet but i am fearful that the death toll could reach double figures
9106115 what we have been able to glean so far is that the major source of damage has been flooding and mudslides the wind damage doesnt seem to have been as extensive as we might have feared perhaps because the wind speed had actually dropped somewhat down to 65 miles per hour we have confirmed so far that we have lost two main bridges one at harbour view and the westmoreland bridge which goes from the junction road on that route that takes you to highgate
9106116 in gordon town for example there are by rough estimates some 31 persons who have had to take refuge on their roof tops because of mudslides we will have to airlift them off their roofs i have spoken with the chief of defence staff as soon as the weather conditions allow the helicopters to fly we are sending out a special rescue team to actually get them off their roofs thankfully some of them are within sight of the gordon town police station so we are able to monitor the situation and hopefully there wont be any further mudslides because if that were to be the case then we could really have a serious crisis on our hands

9106120 cruzan rum will be fortunes only rum product giving the brand the opportunity to enjoy access to the resources needed to achieve its growth

9106163 republicans created in effect minority districts wherein narrow bands of the electorate often anti tax conservatives have disproportionate influence the key to winning and holding such house seats sucking up to the right its not always a pretty sight but survival compels it and its not just accommodating the grass roots to prevent nomination challenges republicans must kowtow to the house leadership lest they risk such punishment as losing prized committee seats senate republicans many of them recovering tax aholics have become similarly sheepish

9106186 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9106187 the announcement of governor palins selection on john mccains 72nd birthday highlights the fact t hat the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one sarah palin is a 2 year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of 9 000
9106188 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgement it shows political panic

9106208 shes anti choice even in the case of incest or rape
9106209 she will fire up the young women who want it all because shes a woman who has it all shes got a family shes got a career

9106237 this is a very special country for the peace corps we cherish the relationship with the philippines over 8 000 volunteers served in over 47 years of the peace corps history in the philippines thats the largest thats served in any country in the world
9106238 i cannot express enough my appreciation to the philippine government for the way they handled the situation how quickly they found the body the incident has not affected our opinion and our presence in the philippines we dont see any situation at the present time that could threaten our presence in the philippines
9106239 i hope someday we could do that but today that is not the case the safety and security of our volunteers is of primary importance and we honor that our volunteers are vulnerable and if its not appropriate we wont put them there

9106245 its good to go out there every fifth game and feel good

9106257 we found a way to win we found a way to win on the road we just found a way and thats a big step for us
9106258 i believe there is enough there to raise suspicion about the whole process the allegations seem to fall into three major categoreis voter intimidation voter suppression and election irregularities
9106259 a group of mr glantons supporters mailed out approximately 800 fliers to african american registered voters in district 2 more than 200 were returned undelivered from the city of greenville i have the 200 returned fliers in my possession at this time
9106260 on february 3 2008 he was in district 2 then in march he was arbitrarily switched over to district 1 his house has not moved the district lines have not moved how does a voter get switched out of one district and into another without some explanation of why
9106261 i do not believe all of these allegations put together can be dismissed without raising serious concerns about the fairness of the election process in meriwether county these incidents are not coincidental and they warrant an indepth investigation by your office and corrective action

9106281 palin was behind the construction of the wasilla multi use sports complex a 15 million multi use indoor ice arena as her legacy however developer gary lundgren acquired the land before palin could without the deed palin decided to build the arena there anyway and attempted to acquire the land through eminent domain but a federal appeals court ruled in favor of lundgren the case is in the process of being resolved in the courts 13 it will cost wasilla at least an additional 1 67 million to acquire the land 14 and wasilla is still attempting to cover the budget shortfall by cutting library services postponing capital improvement projects and raising fees

9106323 a lot of these guys were hurt before we even got here
9106324 i want know how they respond when theyre under duress and stress meaning theyre very tired meaning things arent going well in the game
9106325 that is a concern with me how do they respond when its very challenging and theyre in that moment how are they going to respond when things arent going well i know its been a weakness here and i know its something we have to overcome
9106326 were just so much more demanding than what they are used to doing i think there was a little bit of mental shock along with some physical shock
9106327 were looking for a particular type of person when i say that im not looking for a particular type of athlete but a particular type of a person its a person we know will fit on our philosophies there are some players here that dont and there are some that just havent bought in they just dont quite understand it its not like theyre trying not to buy in its just still a shock to their system
9106328 we want kids that are extremely dependable that are very passionate about the game of football very passionate about washington state
9106329 we want players that want to be part of our philosophy thats what we want those kind of guys
9106330 and he throws that knuckleball to me i keep telling him when he learns to change speeds more and throw it for strikes hes going to be as good or better than boston starter tim wakefield
9106331 miguel pointed that out to me and i tried it in a game
9106332 it worked well sometimes with the knuckleball though it rolls and then the logo pops up again its hard to make every pitch do the same thing but it was a tip that helped a lot
9106333 for what its worth i think youll make a terrific mother and i want to be a part of any child we have from beginning to end a legal binding no getting out of it connection that everyone in the world will recognize and acknowledge
9106334 they just werent ready for a female veep thats all

9106395 im wondering whether over time you have become more comfortable navigating that ocean of robbies lust
9106396 remember everything from the last two years because its all testable
9106397 it was too much to comprehend new york city was like a huge crematory the unforgettable smell of death lingered for over a year
9106398 putting my clients first includes keeping myself accessible being an excellent listener as well as a fine communicator and responding quickly to their needs in addition there are qualities that go into being an outstanding real estate professional integrity in depth community and market awareness marketing savvy effective negotiation skills and a high quality professional network all of which are hallmarks of how i work
9106399 i am so excited with the historic choice that provides a great balance to our ticket
9106400 she certainly will appeal to all of america as a mom and popular elected governor who defeated an incumbent using fighting corruption as one of her strengths
9106401 i think its absolutely the best choice he could have made
9106402 the best word to describe her would be a lady who knows what needs to be done she is sharp incredibly intelligent she doesnt take guff she knows how to answer the questions and shes gotten the job done in alaska when many men could not do it
9106403 i was incredibly impressed with her she knows her stuff im excited because it shows me that senator mccains pick of governor palin highlights the central place that the energy debate occupies in our national conversation
9106404 governor sarah palin will bring with her a wealth of life experience to the white house from serving as a popular and effective leader of alaska to balancing her personal life as a wife and mother she is a reformer and a public servant that hoosier women and all hoosiers can relate to
9106405 john mccain outsmarted all of us i thought for sure it was former massachusetts gov mitt romney this is a very pleasant surprise so much of the coverage had focused around romney and minnesota gov tim pawlenty
9106406 in doing this i think mccain has achieved his objective and made a broad appeal to the folks that need to have some representation on the presidential ticket
9106407 im going to go to bed very pleased tonight its a great selection
9106408 i dont know enough about her to comment other than shes a governor of alaska im sure this woman is a good person and being governor of a state is an important job but i just dont know what else she brings to the ticket at this stage of the game i just dont know enough about her
9106409 im sure they felt they needed to do something to get more media attention than what theyve been getting after what barack and biden have been getting
9106410 our country faces many tough challenges from an economy that is no longer working for working families to a war in iraq that has distracted us from the war on terror and strained our military
9106411 instead of choosing a running mate who has the experience to be a real partner in bringing change to this country john mccain made a political pick in an attempt to reverse the anxiety republicans are feeling about his campaign rather than reversing the anxiety working families have about their future and their childrens future
9106412 its critical that senator mccain continues to reach out to the conservative base of the party which he has done
9106413 im excited ive been hoping for decades to see a woman on the republican ticket and governor palin was worth waiting for a reformer a seasoned executive and best of all normal and authentic great choice
9106414 a for a das mulheres e eu sou totalmente a favor ela muito inteligente e tem uma fam lia muito doce o filho dela est no ex rcito e o meu irm o tamb m serve temos muito em comum a escolha dos meus sonhos quase chorei no palco
9106415 ele john mccain gosta de acordar cedo e sair parece que ela tamb m gosta
9106416 sou uma pessoa da manh n s n o dormimos muito temos muito a fazer o que tenho que fazer no meio da noite desligar o blackberry e usar a bombinha de leite
9106417 we had a couple of bad breaks in the beginning of the second half on the two goals and anytime you play a man down its tough
9106418 i think it was a tremendous effort to play with 10 players and to create as many opportunities as we did we made very young mistakes tonight and we have to be more disciplined
9106419 i want to continue to see the fight that we showed when playing with a man down tonight
9106420 they never quit tonight we are getting better every game and our back line was much more organized than we were last friday we have to make some adjustments for sundays game without ashley and move forward
9106421 nosotros hemos repudiado tremendamente este acto y vamos a aplicar con rigor la ley pero tambi n con la sensatez de no prejuzgar de no partir haciendo cosas locas por manos individuales sino que respetando la institucionalidad que este pa s tiene

9106427 m s que una carta pastoral es un libro con toda la fundamentaci n de datos y lo importante es que es la intervenci n de una figura de iglesia con preocupaci n por la tica
9106428 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial y ltimamente el aprovechamiento pol tico y la agitaci n del senador alberto espina
9106429 exigimos respeto por los derechos de los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos mapuche considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad donde los ni os las mujeres y los ancianos son objetos de actos de violencia institucional los hechos de violencia institucional se repiti en el allanamiento del d a domingo 24 de agosto en donde resultaron varios ni os mujeres y ancianos con asfixias y lesiones esta situaci n sucede porque carabinero act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9106430 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta elocuente situaci n pone de relieve y desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9106431 denunciamos la agitaci n para el uso de la violencia institucional de parte del senador alberto espina unidos al gremio de agricultores agrupados en la sofo y muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche asimismo el gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las arma de fuego en contra de los mapuche
9106432 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos vinculados a los agricultores a las empresas forestales y el propio estado chileno
9106433 en vista que el estado chileno no ha protegido nuestros derechos el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios en esta oportunidad concurriremos a la jurisdicci n internacional y a los mecanismos de protecci n a los derechos humanos para solicitar medidas cautelares a favor de las comunidades y la protecci n de los ni os mujeres y ancianos mapuche
9106434 el pueblo mapuche tiene la amplia disposici n para el di logo en la medida que el derecho a la autodeterminaci n el autogobierno mapuche y el territorio sean los ejes fundamentales del di logo

9106439 i always feel like somebodys biting me right where my private is oh oh oh
9106440 she drives the bus because she loves kids and she loves to work
9106441 then what happened was that she went ahead and said that she would turn off the air conditioner you know trying to get them to be quiet
9106442 especially with all the stories you hear about children dying in hot cars theres no reason anyone should be disciplined that way
9106443 every set we play 5 all but she sometimes played soft sometimes she hit hard so always change for me its tough
9106444 i have gotten in trouble with the wta before i have been on the line as far as tennis apparel goes

9106502 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

9106522 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
9106523 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
9106524 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
9106525 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos

9106540 el agua dada la trascendencia que tiene para la vida humana el agua realmente est dentro de la categor a de los derechos humanos
9106541 comprobamos c mo los recursos naturales son extra dos y contaminados por el ego smo de algunos de intereses de grupos de poder amparados por el actual modelo econ mico en perjuicio de los pobres los campesinos y los ind genas un cuidado especial merece el recurso del agua que empieza a ser escaso convirti ndose en el mediano plazo en fuente de conflictos en el mundo
9106542 ticamente es para nosotros inaceptable sea el proyecto en s mismo que planea construir cinco mega centrales en ays n y consideramos inaceptable la postura del estado frente a estas situaciones que se han ido dando con incluso apoyos p blicos de algunos ministros previo a la presentaci n del proyecto de impacto ambiental
9106543 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
9106544 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

9106553 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9106554 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo

9106565 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9106566 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9106567 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9106568 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio

9106579 nearly a third of the respondents said the olympics had inspired them to participate in more sports events and diversify their exercises
9106580 she loved her daddy more than anything in the world
9106581 she had the perfect life and was the perfect little girl and will always be remembered that way

9106585 we are extremely disappointed that carol albert has decided to give up on the future of coney island
9106586 it would be an absolute shame if astrolands lease is not renewed for another season
9106587 he told her she would be a terrific candidate and that he looked forward to seeing her on the campaign trail he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9106588 we send our congratulations to governor sarah palin and her family on her designation as the republican nominee for vice president it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9106589 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9106590 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9106591 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9106592 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9106593 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies
9106594 the peeing for me was instant because i needed one but the whole process with the paperwork was probably 15 minutes

9106603 the commerzbank board would not hold negotiations that it did not think it could finance
9106604 they work very hard for each other defensively i think most teams that have beaten them have had to play pretty close to their best footy for the majority of the game
9106605 they have guys who can just open up the game from anywhere at any time
9106606 we know what is in front of us we are looking to get back on the horse
9106607 we have had a bit of success in the past in games that have got a bit of emotion attached to it so hopefully we can channel that in the right direction
9106608 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
9106609 finally the afp have decided to tell the world what weve been saying since we got involved in the matter
9106610 but i think it would be early days yet and we should wait until the clarke inquiry concludes before we go down that path
9106611 its difficult to know why it took so long it shouldnt have
9106612 and i believe that it was just mainly the afp playing games with mohameds freedom
9106613 it was a very complicated issue and afp police commissioner mick keelty decided that he would deal with it in that fashion
9106614 im not an expert in that area so its a bit out of my league to try and give ranges or estimates of what it could be
9106615 because it means now that if he ever has the plans to come back those plans can be looked at a little more seriously
9106616 but its unlikely that hell come back in the immediate future but it may happen later

9106656 gov sarah palin plans to explore ways alaska can reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions as part of a global warming strategy to be developed by a new subcabinet of top administration officials
9106657 from palins press release governor sarah palin today removed jim clark and richard schok from the alaska natural gas development authority board and replaced them with her own appointments clark and schok were appointed to the angda board in the waning hours before governor frank murkowski left office opting for alaskans who will provide objectivity and new energy to the angda board palin reappointed fairbanks resident andy warwick to fill clarks seat lorrie hovanec of anchorage will fill schoks seat

9106716 we arrived here much earlier than teams normally would and had five good competitive practice matches we are familiar with the conditions the results are irrelevant because the objective was to get hard practice and we certainly got that
9106717 i am particularly pleased with the way our batsmen have performed we crossed 300 twice and made 288 270 and 229 our bowlers are also showing signs that they are getting their rhythm back
9106718 we havent played there but i watched australias warm up match against the ais yesterday the outfield is vast and drop in pitches can have variable bounce they really australia struggled to score and i do hope that happens tomorrow also i think anything between 220 to 240 would be a competitive total on that wicket
9106719 those performances gave us a lot of confidence but for a repeat we have to do the process right in batting bowling and fielding here we are looking forward to the matches and the fact bthat they are without some of their top players doesnt concern us we are thinking of our own game and how best we can execute our plan
9106720 i can remember it pretty well that in the cardiff game the wicket played a few tricks early and we bangladesh won the toss and bowled if we can get a wicket like that out here that is better for us to bowl on then well be competitive and have a chance of winning the game
9106721 the only thing that will play into our hands a little bit is the fact that they australia havent been playing a lot of cricket and we have it has happened to the aussies before theyve had little breaks and it takes them a game or two to get going in the warm up match they looked a bit rusty especially in batting but they were typical australia while bowling
9106722 the side that weve got is a more talented side without a doubt whether theyre as match hardened or as internationally match hardened is another thing but the ability that this side has got now definitely promise a far better side a far more naturally gifted side for the future
9106723 i can guarantee you that definitely wont happen this time it has happened to us before and weve lost as soon as you take things for granted i think you find yourself asking questions why youve lost that game its certainly a memory that you never forget
9106724 for me personally its not because bangladesh beat australia its because we took a team for granted from that day ive certainly learnt that in international cricket you cant afford to do that
9106725 id describe this as the place your grandma would own right down to the porch swing if your grandma was rich
9106726 he made a great choice in gov palin she is a great campaigner she will be great on the ticket and will certainly fight hard as will i
9106727 we need to couple technology with the job we do day in and day out and this is going to afford us to do that
9106728 we want to keep them guessing but we want them to also know that we are very much watching them in those very critical areas

9106772 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9106773 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9106774 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9106775 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9106776 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming governor palin agrees with him and his policies

9106794 finally the afp have decided to tell the world what weve been saying since we got involved in the matter
9106795 but i think it would be early days yet and we should wait until the clarke inquiry concludes before we go down that path
9106796 its difficult to know why it took so long it shouldnt have
9106797 and i believe that it was just mainly the afp playing games with mohameds freedom
9106798 it was a very complicated issue and afp police commissioner mick keelty decided that he would deal with it in that fashion
9106799 im not an expert in that area so its a bit out of my league to try and give ranges or estimates of what it could be
9106800 because it means now that if he ever has the plans to come back those plans can be looked at a little more seriously
9106801 but its unlikely that hell come back in the immediate future but it may happen later
9106802 at the moment i understand hes only working as a gp

9106810 hi mommies had a long day and has gone to bed she promised me i could update you so in spite of the problem of typing without opposable thumbs i hope youll appreciate that i might make a typo i hope its nothing awful just something little
9106811 im mommies sewing assistant and she says that sometimes i just get in the way but someone has to watch the back of the machine that light in the front the big white oval thing in the photo is really bright but mommie says it lets her see true colors in the fabrics and that helps her make her bags really cool i just think its super bright its also warm i like that in the winter but she doesnt let me up under it very often
9106812 mommie says she has to make a lot of bags for the cat show im not sure what she means by a cat show but some of these bags are brand spanking new fabrics and some have been on the shelves for a bit mommie always has a hard time deciding which ones to use as she loves them all i suggested the tabby fabric in the mera down below because frankly i dont like tabbies much and would like to see this fabric disappear mommie says im discriminating against those who are not like me and thats not a nice thing to do i love my mommie but sometimes i just dont understand her the siamese is the top cat im surprised she doesnt agree with me
9106813 today mommie made 7 of these posy sock sacks that everyone went nuts over last summer i heard her say she thinks thats a record for the number of bags shes ever made in one day
9106814 she says thats the reason she had to go to bed im glad she did i dont get many chances to talk to you all alone you know sometimes i wish mommie didnt spend so much time sewing i like her to pet me and play with me instead but she says she has to be sure theres kibble for me and the calico curmudgeon i havent seen kibble come out of those bags so i dont know what she means but shes very serious when she says it
9106815 before she was finished sewing today she had posies all over the cutting table on the ironing board on the stand she sets things on while shes sewing and of course in her lap ive never seen so many bags at once we should have lots of kibble i think
9106816 i guess id better go up and snuggle with mommie now im glad i got the chance to fill you in on our very busy day i hope i can chat with you again soon
9106817 well i talk to them and when theyre doing something they shouldnt be doing i give them something else to do

9106828 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9106829 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers

9106902 religion just like abortion is an individuals choice which they should let women make
9106903 in case such a pregnancy is aborted that amounts to murder based on this law we are therefore opposed to such blanket proposals
9106904 in fact some of us do not know who our fathers are even sons or daughters of criminals end up being very good people the unborn have no sins
9106905 mps have no plans to pass a law that will encourage abortion
9106906 as fida we know that this is an emotive issue to us this bill has nothing to do with good or bad it is meant to uphold the right of women in making logical choices in life
9106907 it is not a matter of giving women the permission to decide whether to abort or not it is about legalising abortion to improve their physical and mental health

9106921 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9106922 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9106923 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9106924 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9106925 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9106926 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9106927 given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination

9107055 he promised to pull the plug on the snowy if he was elected

9107142 i have grown up listening to rock and metal music which is slowly dying in the state due to lack of infrastructure and platform so am interested to put some efforts to revive it
9107143 i have been staying in delhi for three years and has learned so many new concepts about rock music hence we began to organise musical shows and events in and across the town
9107144 most of the rock bands have diverted into the pub shows because organising rock show in such a small township becomes very expensive and even if organised it fails to cover the cost of expenses therefore for survival the bands have decided to divert into pub singing and lounge performances
9107145 but many wrong conceptions exist in our state about the rock bands like those who are involved with rock music get into alcoholism and so on
9107146 we should come forward to help the bands to grow and prosper in order to remove the old reservations
9107147 this is unfortunate that we were discouraged by such big houses like rsj just because they realise that sikkim doesnt have good professional rockers
9107148 we are trying to encourage new bands to perform in and across the state to overcome the rejections at national level
9107149 i have always tried to incorporate something new since i open the lounge bar and i have always encouraged rock music
9107150 we had organised rock show with mantra and smoot riff regional rock band from neighboring darjeeling last year to enhance the entertainment culture we are also going to have in house band very soon

9107171 while we dont yet know the potential impact of this storm it is nonetheless our responsibility to answer the call for assistance from our friends along the gulf coast as we did in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and will continue to do
9107172 because hurricane hanna is a potential threat to the east coast of the united states later next week we were careful not to over commit our resources
9107173 but it is important that the states work together whenever a part of the country is threatened with a major storm

9107197 the mccain palin ticket has the experience to lead the effort to fix a broken washington
9107198 gov palin has executive experience as a mayor and governor and is a strong proponent of life and family
9107199 we dont have enough people in washington who understand the importance of local and state government
9107200 the upside for john mccain is it creates an opportunity for a historic ballot on either side
9107201 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9107202 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic

9107217 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
9107218 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

9107247 at that time not only i myself wanted to join the communist party there were also several hundred tibetans who already joined the communist party during the 30s and 40s

9107249 the dalai lama is the head representative of the serf system which integrated religion with politics in old tibet the middle way approach that the dalai lama is pursuing is aimed at restoring his own paradise in the past which will throw millions of liberated serfs back into a dark cage
9107250 i think since many years as everybody knows that we never aim to restore the old system and even the dalai lama institution as early as 69 i made clear that this institution should continue or not is up to people
9107251 at the beginning we thought the youth congress was very important just like any youth organization in a community youth is the basis of the future but around 1974 we made up our mind that we will return to china so independence is out of the question therefore we must find a middle way not the present situation nor independence or separation but gradually the youth congress becomes very critical towards our position of not seeking independence and separation so right from the beginning of course they are tibetans and buddhists who often come to see me i made it clear that your stance is very different from ours i also often criticize them because theyre not realistic
9107252 hopefully i think i may not be dealing with the question of my reincarnation as for the two panchen lamas i think the official one tibetans generally are not very faithful to so its for our mutual interest to avoid such controversies

9107430 this is a pretty cool job here too though as governor of alaska
9107431 the padres are excited about our continued agreement with the portland beavers
9107432 with merritt paulson and his staff we know we have a great partner in the portland franchise the player and staff experience in portland is a vital part of the growth process to the major leagues and is a perfect fit for the padres organization
9107433 we look forward to continuing our association with merritt paulson and the entire portland beavers organization for the next two years
9107434 as the final stepping stone before they enter into the major leagues several of our players have reaped the benefits of the great facility and staff in portland
9107435 im taking it as an opportunity that i got to take advantage of
9107436 whether it means i have 20 at bats or more than that whatever it might be in between there im excited for the opportunity and its my job to be ready everyday and go out there and do what im supposed to do
9107437 i dont know how that works but im ready to go
9107438 im happy and i think its almost good for me before i realize whats going on to get out there i dont have to sit around and think about when im going to play all day i know im in there so i can go about my normal preparation and try to take care of business
9107439 i still dont think its set in im excited to be here and im excited about the opportunity im still not really grasping it but im definitely excited
9107440 i like to go out there and be aggressive on the basepaths i like to think that i can swing it and ill try to make adjustments up here like i did in triple a run the ball down and be a solid defender im definitely not a super speed guy like a lot of center fielders but i like to think that im efficient and i get the job done so thats what im going to try to do
9107441 i mean i have no idea just walking out there for the first time ive been here before but never been on the field just walking out there for the first time it was just like this is it man this is what youve been working all this time for and like i said it hasnt really hit me hopefully the nerves wont be a problem tonight
9107442 whenever you get walk offed twice and you earn two losses its pretty tough
9107443 but you learn each time the good thing is my arm feels great and thats all i can really do i just have to forget about everything thats happened and just keep going out there
9107444 you could sit there and say move him out of those roles but the way our games are going whats the difference if he goes in for the sixth inning with the game tied and gives up a run or in the ninth inning
9107445 hes got to get people out no matter where we put him in the game thats the bottom line hes going to have to make some better pitches he knows that
9107446 that was a bad pitch last night but i had to come in and throw a strike
9107447 i tried to throw a good four spot fastball and he was waiting for it
9107448 i couldnt ask for much more to be healthy and have made so many appearances this season
9107449 but we need to go out there and keep winning these games you know its a tough roadtrip and its frustrating losing three games by a run or in the last at bat i just have to keep focusing on doing what i can its a long season i wasnt there last year to do it so mentally youve got to get used to that too and just keep on going
9107450 weve got to find some continuity weve got a lot of guys that are out and it is something weve talked about with garret before
9107451 hes hit in a multitude of spots with the guys that are there today i think it is good to try and find some continuity by lining those guys up and with garret ahead of them
9107452 with this group of guys here right now i think the best option is to line them up and move garret up there to the two hole
9107453 i think even though you have that deadline you want to make the best decision for your club
9107454 just because the deadline is in place it doesnt mean you do something that doesnt benefit your team
9107455 i think it would strengthen us but were confident the pieces we have here will get us where we want to be
9107456 as long as their up here the more comfortable theyll be
9107457 when youre not swinging the bat well the other aspects of your game have to be elevated and i think theyve been able to do that
9107458 i thought he had some good looks at the plate
9107459 he laid off some good pitches he looks more comfortable than he was a few months ago
9107460 i have more confidence now that there are not adjustments that need to be made right now
9107461 i think the swing and the foundation i built the last couple of months has a chance to be successful and now i just have to go out there and do it
9107462 hes got to come up here and perform if you take a look at his last seven or eight or weeks in the minors you saw him strike out less and walk more while swinging at his pitch those are things he has to do here and if he can accomplish those things at the minor league level were confident he can do it here

9107476 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9107477 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9107478 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her
9107479 she brings her voice of new energy and change and she knows alaska
9107480 this shocking choice says more about mccains desperation than it does about palins qualifications

9107516 i dont want to open the wounds of the 70s
9107517 they will not go beyond the bounds of the law and would maintain a reactive group

9107527 not too long ago in bali before an international audience of scientists and policy makers atienza called on world leaders to act urgently to address the global threat of climate change which he said will condemn the philippines to poverty now he is singing an entirely different tune his motives for giving his all out support for the iloilo coal project are extremely suspect the secretary is either ignorant or he has concealed motivations that are stronger than his sworn duty to protect the countrys ecosystems

9107542 the rollback should be at least p6 7 00 which is roughly equivalent to the oil price hikes in may and june this year we are concerned that it is taking the oil companies forever to give consumers a substantial relief from high oil prices
9107543 the oil firms are quick to raise prices but are unbearably slow when it comes to lowering prices the small rollbacks while welcome are not enough given the huge increases over the past few months
9107544 inflation has already reached 11 4 the highest in 14 years and all the government does is to tell us the vat is good for us this surely doesnt make much sense given the severe economic burden on the people and the ensuing economic slowdown facing the country

9107549 the existence of this armed group will only escalate the armed conflict in the region and will not in any way help in the pursuit of a negotiated political settlement on the just demands of the bangsamoro people to self determination

9107730 yeah but you could run into an opponent thats under 500 and their pitcher can be on that night and all of a sudden it becomes an extremely tough opponent i know the bottom line is we have to win you just have to worry about winning that night because if you start looking ahead or you start looking at okay were so many games back we have to make up three in one week you never know which week that youre going to make up a lot of games

9107740 siapakah yang lebih aniaya daripada orang yang mengadakan dusta terhadap allah atau mendustakan kebenaran tatkala ia datang kepadanya bukankah dalam neraka jahannam itu ada tempat tinggal bagi orang orang kafir

9107742 dan ia memasuki kebunnya sedang ia aniaya terhadap dirinya sendiri ia berkata aku kira kebun ini tidak akan binasa selama lamanya dan aku kira kiamat tidak akan datang dan jika sekiranya aku dikembalikan kepada rabbku niscaya akan kudapati tempat kembali yang lebih baik temannya yang mukmin berkata kepadanya apakah engkau kafir kepada rabb yang menciptakanmu dari tanah kemudian dari setetes air mani kemudian dia menjadikanmu seorang laki laki tetapi aku percaya bahwa dialah allah rabbku dan aku tidak menyekutukannya dengan sesuatupun

9107762 i couldnt think of a more exciting way to open the season
9107763 were happy and feel fortunate to win this match im really proud of our effort in game five fighting off five match points thats a sign of a true team that believes in itself and a more mature team the bad part is that we dont feel like we gave ourselves the opportunity we needed early in the match we lost a lot of little battles that created difficult match ups for us but we showed our resiliency and we may have lost those little battles but we ended up winning the war a amp m is a very good team and i really credit their effort
9107764 she had a difficult time finding a tempo early which led to a lot of difficulty early in the match
9107765 and elena came through in a big way with her 31 digs
9107766 our defense kept us in the match when our offense wasnt what we expected it to be early in the match i really credit elena for keeping the ball off the floor thats the kind of play we expect from our senior and she delivered
9107767 and im still waiting for the rain to fall pour real life down on me cause i cant hold on to anything this good now am i good enough for you to love me too
9107768 i really want to encourage our tiger fans to come to the game
9107769 i know its early with the 10 a m start but i want the fans to come and support the team the team needs their support i encourage our students to come
9107770 there was discussion of postponing the game fortunately with working with the weather service and working with the state officials we came to this conclusion that i think is the best of both worlds it provides for our team the opportunity to compete for our fans to watch lsu football which is part of our culture and so important to everyone but also provides for the safety for our citizens and allows the time for evacuation as it comes necessary
9107771 we understand the reason for the change in the kickoff time and i can tell you that this team will be ready to play no matter what time the game starts
9107772 we are excited about playing our season opener in tiger stadium in front of the greatest fans in college football and we just hope that the time change doesnt inconvenience our fans to the point where they cant make it to the game
9107773 i think the veteran offensive line coupled with the veteran receivers and some of the things were trying to do will take a little bit of pressure off that quarterback position
9107774 its an advantage to the quarterbacks when everybody knows what to do
9107775 i have great confidence in all three quarterbacks and i can tell you that im comfortable with any of the three who are on the field for us were going to ask him to do the things that we need from the quarterback spot but not to do anything that theyre not capable of doing
9107776 they spread the field and create space and its an issue with a team that throws the ball well and its an issue with a team that can run the football as well as they do
9107777 it just requires that you be disciplined you have to know your responsibilities and know the call thats being made and play your responsible technique i think our guys understand that
9107778 its appalachian states offense very similar to an option offense its similar to a spread and throw it offense they attack the width of the field as well as the vertical seams its a great challenge and i think our guys understand that they must play disciplined in this game
9107779 i have a strong suspicion that well be ready to play and be very competitive
9107780 i think in every opener that ive been around you make mistakes and i think there will be mistakes made i dont think anybody even the veterans will play perfect but i think well play well and i think it will be an exciting game

9107841 were starting a new tradition here weve got good coaches and good players
9107842 were an option team and some of the plays that were called in the first half it is up to the quarterback to make the read it just ended up that herbin didnt get the ball on those plays
9107843 in the second half we called plays that were designed for him hes an explosive player you never know what is going to happen when he gets the football
9107844 my coach told me that if i just keep on running nobody would be able to catch me
9107845 we came right back to start the second half and scored quickly
9107846 thats what won the game for us we did the same thing starting fast last week this is the first time we have been 2 0 since 99 or 2000 and we feel good about that
9107847 what really matters is what you do on the next play we let those miscues hurt us more than they should have
9107848 r c slocum hired me took a chance on me a long time ago a lot of my philosophy on coaching raising my kids living my life was formulated here while i was at college station whether it was in a staff meeting with r c or meeting with aggies going to the churches going to the schools
9107849 so a lot of who i am as a man forget coaching was formulated here at a amp m ive never forgotten that and now to come back full circle at this point in my life is very unique in many ways but also very gratifying

9107852 healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9107853 its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9107854 im a christian and i believe in parents being able to provide children with religious instruction without interference from the state but i also believe our schools are there to teach worldly knowledge and science i believe in evolution and i believe theres a difference between science and faith that doesnt make faith any less important than science it just means theyre two different things and i think its a mistake to try to cloud the teaching of science with theories that frankly dont hold up to scientific inquiry

9107860 unless youre able to defend you arent going to win we have to go back to defense to start winning again
9107861 we can either get better or we could fold our tents
9107862 our post defense wasnt very good in the first half
9107863 i kind of started all this for fun and i honestly didnt expect it to go this far im really not an ambitious sort of person i am so shocked its come to this everything i do is for fun and to be helpful
9107864 i really love our juicy location so we have also kept that but we were kindly offered a spot on the free style sim
9107865 its a great store that is one of the reasons why i accepted a place on the sim because i knew that free speerit would be there at that point it was only them and us
9107866 i think people enjoyed it too as lots of stores were involved in it i was surprised it went so smoothly as i am so disorganized and it was all arranged last minute
9107867 its amazing how its all come together actually i really like that it is a diverse selection from established designers and people who are new to it a lot of them are in the free style group and experimenting and as luck should have it everything offered is great
9107868 all the designers have been so generous too i was stunned with how many wanted to take part
9107869 the last time he left a lot of pitches up today he threw more strikes we just hit his mistakes when he made some
9107870 the first pitch to encarnacion wasnt a bad pitch a changeup that was kind of flat
9107871 thats really what did us in tonight the defense we just made too many mistakes there gave them too many outs
9107872 we needed this offense for our confidence they helped us out with their defense
9107873 after the 3 0 lead i took guillermo out because he took a knock on his ankle
9107874 he always wants to play 90 minutes but i felt there was an opportunity for another whack they way they were playing and then we dropped off a little too much we defended too much we gave them too much space we made hesmer earn the shutout
9107875 last year wasnt a great year so it wasnt too great of a thing
9107876 but to be better already than we were last year is a good thing hopefully we can keep getting points and clinch that playoff spot
9107877 obviously when you give up a goal in extended time you feel like something got away
9107878 but its also nice that we got a point on the road and we played 30 plus minutes with a man down im glad to get a point
9107879 we held until about the last two minutes of the game
9107880 before we started if we leave with a point maybe were satisfied with it but obviously i think the course of the game changed that and i think were leaving here a little disappointed
9107881 they played good we played bad and therefore thats what makes up for the score
9107882 two goals down after the first 30 minutes is difficult to overcome i dont think we had that little zip in our step that we had in our last couple of games and all around the field we were just below average
9107883 i thought against l a from the first whistle the team played very well
9107884 we moved the ball and created some good chances it was a little bit unfortunate not to score a goal early but i think in the second half we kept doing what we should have been doing and then we got a great goal by john thorrington
9107885 i think brian is a great teammate and a true professional
9107886 hes come in here and shown our guys that hes capable of playing in big games and helping us do little things and last weekend john thorrington played a ball into him and he held it up pretty well and then laid it back to him when john was through we expect a lot from brian and i think hes excited to be back playing with us in chicago all in all we are excited to get the deal done and hes here now
9107887 we do miss his playmaking ability and his ability to make a pass out of nowhere which he has done for us so many times this year
9107888 we have to make up for that in other areas and work that bit harder and create chances for ourselves more than just expecting to get the ball we will be very relieved to have him back but it helps us to play a game without him
9107889 the expansion tag doesnt wash with us anymore realistically the playoffs are within reach now and it comes down to us
9107890 we have three home games now in a row so we got to take the best we can out of that
9107891 if we can earn two wins out of those three games we have a terrific chance of doing pretty well at the end of the year
9107892 its really in our hand if we can pull ourselves together
9107893 to be honest on the chances it was pretty even on the play i think chivas played better than us probably
9107894 but what i liked about our night tonight we didnt crumble and we stayed in there and we actually came back in the end and we could have stolen it so that was encouraging
9107895 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9107896 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun

9107900 those are the cards that were dealt and others are dealt
9107901 im just trying to find my legs and itll take a little while ill listen to my body and make sure im giving it the right amount of rest after being out for so long
9107902 anybody who thought it was going to be easy doesnt know anything
9107903 they were a yard quicker than us all night it was difficult for us because it gave them such an advantage
9107904 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9107905 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9107906 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9107907 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9107908 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9107909 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9107910 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9107911 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9107912 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9107913 we expect the same things we always expect in games against d c
9107914 they are always tough they are a good side going forward we showed in the year that we can beat them as well now we got the momentum going and its going to be a different kind of game
9107915 obviously it goes without saying when you beat the champions then you think you can compete and thats what i told the guys
9107916 i believe with the effort that we showed sunday and with the team spirit and the way we can play soccer now we can compete against houston and every other team in the league
9107917 we just prepare for every game as it comes d c united will be a different threat a different team its just right that we have more competition for places and i have more options and hopefully i can decide what is best for the club
9107918 but the game dictated him to do other things colorado was dropping everybody back in it was hard to break them down so what ends up opening when teams drop are outside the box shots he gave joe vide a great ball and joe put himself in a good spot to get a goal credit luci because he did what was needed
9107919 i worked hard against colorado and i worked for the team its important to win games if i can assist ill assist but i like it better when i score goals

9107923 we really turned things around after the first game and we showed major confidence and composure after having it handed to us at first
9107924 genny was hitting hard and katie gallagher did a nice job of running the offense for us
9107925 ashley woods came off the bench and played well as well as maria andersson showing some good things for us
9107926 lane carico came up big for us in the first match and it was good to get a win over sacramento state in the opener it says a lot about or program when we can beat a team that advanced past the first round of last years ncaa tournament
9107927 our defense was good today and i thought we hit better in the second match than we did in the first
9107928 cassie was just tremendous as she really frustrated the offense for our opponents today and her passing set up katie very well to maneuver the offense into what we wanted to do
9107929 but when the helper comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who proceeds from the father he will bear witness about me and you also will bear witness because you have been with me from the beginning

9107933 how can anyone really know that christianity is the only way how do you truly believe that god exists cant all the other religions be just as right since they believe just as strongly why are we here what is our purpose where did everything come from

9107939 now if we find a contaminated bin under the terms of section 46 of the environmental protection act we serve a notice on every adult person in the household concerned this instructs them what they should put in their bins if we do bill them and they dont pay they will not be prosecuted under section 46 but can be prosecuted for non payment of a bill which is much easier to prove and will be easier to enforce in the courts
9107940 labours bin policies will harm the environment by causing a surge in fly tipping and fuelling public resentment at town hall bin bullies
9107941 he said all the right things about resource development in alaska
9107942 i didnt have an opportunity to speak to all the candidates but again its not my job to speak to all the candidates and tell americans who to vote for thats americans jobs to figure out what candidates are standing for thats the voters jobs
9107943 i talk about involvement by americans having a say in where the nation is going to go
9107944 this is an exciting day and for alaska you know i hope we register on somebodys radar screen

9108072 we decided early on in the preseason that we wanted to put some pressure on people this year
9108073 we came out and did that tonight and you really couldnt ask for much more than a shutout
9108074 i thought we did a lot of things well up front tonight which allowed brad morton to do some things early
9108075 last week we wanted to run the ball a lot to keep southern durhams offense off the field and this week i wanted us to be a little more balanced
9108076 we made a couple of mistakes early and they just got on a roll
9108077 it was hard for us to dig out of the hole we made a lot of mistakes up front and did some things we dont normally do but well work hard to be better for next week
9108078 its still early in the year and i thought a lot of those penalties were aggressive ones ones when we were trying to make some things happen offsides false starts those are the kinds of things that really irk you as a coach but well work on that as we approach the meat of our schedule

9108095 knowing how closely were going to be working with the hendrick organization it has to be someone that the hendrick organization feels comfortable with to work with their people too theres a lot of equation other than saying i like this guy its not near that easy
9108096 when i get to the race track on the weekends im going to be a driver im not going to be an owner
9108097 my job on friday saturday and sunday is to get in behind the wheel and to do what ive done all my life
9108098 obviously monday through thursday is a little different role and be a little more hectic but the weekends will be the same for me as far as my role and what i do
9108099 i feel great about the effort thats being put forth
9108100 im proud of my team im proud of zippy im proud of our guys and how hard they are digging but we just havent found that one thing or two things that we need right now
9108101 the great thing about this organization is that these guys wont quit it doesnt matter if with two races to go were 12th in the points they are still going to keep working just as hard as we are right now you keep doing the same things that weve always done for 10 years thats won us 33 races and two championships you keep fighting and you keep working hard and you hope you find it but right now were not where we need to be
9108102 i knew that it was a possibility nascar is a sport that is sponsor dependent i know gem has been working hard to find sponsorship im amazed that they found all the sponsorship this year mr gillett is paying for some of it out of his pocket i dont expect them to do that every year for sure its a shock to learn someone else is taking your spot but they are still working to get a fourth car out there a lot of teams want to go to four cars and this is one of them hopefully it works out if it doesnt for me its a bonus ive enjoyed the year so much i hope to do it for many years if i dont then i understand ive been on the other side of the sponsorship opportunities with players they use to sponsor me in champ car and because of my personality and where i was from it fit the bill perfectly so i got a ride for nine years over there at players i was kind of locked in for eight nine years this time im on the other side and im the one getting the boot its part of racing im not pissed off i kind of expected it i still hope they find it sponsorship they really want to find it with the economy and the way things are reed just fits the bill better thats fine too
9108103 no i dont regret anything i did what i felt was best at the time and thats fine in the grand scheme of things looking back on it i dont even think there was really anything that was that bad about last week i thought it was just real good hard racing and what happened afterwards is stuff that happens at every short track all around the country every week the only bad part about it is just tearing up race cars when you dont need to thats the only bad part
9108104 whenever they have any kind of special event that you dont have to win a pole to be in it thats usually good for us because im not a very good qualifier i havent read all the stuff but i guess ive only been a part of that race once maybe twice you want to be a part of every event so if they make a different way for qualifying thats probably good for us
9108105 ps im not sure ifrs gives a more accurate balance sheet i will study it though

9108134 we trained hard through this meet and our guys showed that our training is progressing well we look forward to next saturday when we will race at virginia
9108135 it was typical first match jitters and we werent playing like weve been playing the past two weeks in our own gym
9108136 we settled down in game three and really played well with more consistent services and disciplined defense
9108137 i was pleased with how we kept fighting and hung in there
9108138 especially after being down 0 2 on the road and in front of a nice crowd
9108139 everyone is working very hard to help this team come together

9108144 i think the safe practice is to use an earpiece so you keep the microwave antenna away from your brain
9108145 since we scored nine goals last game i think we were pretty prepared that they were going to sit in on us a little bit and it was going to be harder to generate as much offense
9108146 i think we did a good job of adjusting there was more space for the midfield to play in because they were sitting back and marking our forwards a lot more
9108147 she had a great game i am really happy with all shots that we had and the opportunities we generated i dont think that anyone was disappointed in that
9108148 you are going to have those nights i mean we were not the sharpest i will take a 35 shot to nothing and a 4 0 win any day of the week over here we have some talent here have some things going and we had some combination play tonight in this game they are not always going to go in we have to keep our heads and keep attacking and attacking i thought we backed away from attacking a little bit more tonight if we are not attacking i am not going to be happy i would rather make some mistakes by attacking and that is the mind set i want this team to have
9108149 our coach carla overbeck has been working a lot with the backs and their shape everyone always steps and has been covering when other people step our midfielders have been tracking really well so our defensive shape looks really good i dont even think they got behind our backs so that says a lot

9108162 with the rebates behind us consumer spending is poised for a major slowdown
9108163 the sluggish spending indicates that consumers are reluctant to tap into those accounts under current economic conditions
9108164 inflation has eaten into consumers spending power and we are looking for a clear slowdown in the economy

9108167 whoah there is no way thats what the author intended even though thats the only valid way to read what the question says we should actually alter the question to what he really meant plane stationary and then ask
9108168 you are assuming that the speed of the plane is measured by the wheels and there is nothing that says that
9108169 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9108170 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9108171 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9108172 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9108173 can this conveyor prevent the plane from reaching takeoff speed

9108191 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9108192 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9108193 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9108194 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9108195 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy

9108200 perception of the other amongst jewish and arab youth in israel
9108201 we have found a serious expression of stereotypical thinking on the jewish students part regarding the arab youth
9108202 these students come in with firm stereotypical baggage regarding the other and in this case this is the arabs
9108203 we were not surprised with the outcome of the research
9108204 anyone who is familiar with the field knows that these warped perceptions exist but these findings are at the most severe extreme of a disturbing phenomenon also up until now i dont think such a high level amongst the jewish students population over a third who admit that are afraid of arabs has ever been recorded

9108214 we are grateful to these board of councilors members for their years of service and support for the carter center in advancing peace and health around the world

9108292 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
9108293 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
9108294 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
9108295 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
9108296 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
9108297 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
9108298 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
9108299 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
9108300 who created them there is still no answer suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace in front of the classroom the class is mesmerized
9108301 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
9108302 have you ever actually felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelt your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
9108303 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
9108304 and that is the problem science has with god there is no evidence only faith
9108305 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
9108306 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
9108307 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
9108308 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
9108309 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
9108310 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
9108311 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavour are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
9108312 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
9108313 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
9108314 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
9108315 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
9108316 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
9108317 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
9108318 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
9108319 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
9108320 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
9108321 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one

9108363 is a person who shares my principles my values my priorities and could be immediately take my place
9108364 wanted to split iraq into three different countries by ethnic lines
9108365 that would have created a civil war he did not want to win
9108366 m aintain a unified iraq by decentralizing it and giving kurds shiites and sunnis breathing room in their own regions
9108367 t he central government would be responsible for common interests like border security and the distribution of oil revenues
9108368 b efore the speech you wrote in the wall street journal that you were unimpressed with the staging the greek column look the hugeness of the arena
9108369 i thought it was a nice touch to see the john mccain ad congratulating barack obama i guess some would quibble with it but i wont be one of those
9108370 highlighted her opposition to a much derided congressional earmark for her state
9108371 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9108372 evidence that the circumstances were not as they had previously been accepted to be
9108373 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
9108374 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
9108375 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
9108376 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
9108377 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
9108378 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking at that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
9108379 it used to be the guy with the camera in the closest now its gone high tech
9108380 he had his own schtick and it was very beautiful and it actually made the moment even that much better
9108381 it wasnt simply being on the bridge it really felt very emotional
9108382 weve got people flying in from all over the world
9108383 because they were closing we decided to do it now
9108384 its really a shame and from the people we talk to staff and people alike it seems that everybodys kind of puzzled why its closing because it seems very popular
9108385 theres a tremendous amount of sadness as you can imagine this is a place that no one wants to next years star trek convention run by creation entertainment which puts on several other similar events will take place at the hilton but a deal has not been reached for 2010
9108386 we had to come in one more time before it went away
9108387 over the weekend the total number of mark zuckerberg pokes ev williams by copying twitter facebook
9108388 big cuts at cmp techweb this week also light reading lost a couple infoweak death of print
9108389 bj mccombs was severely burned in a fire at the age of 18 months
9108390 experiences are helpful where we have direct congruent connection of the mind body and soul
9108391 some monies and checks in an account that did not belong to her and she knew that
9108392 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet meanwhile john mccains wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave
9108393 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets
9108394 michelle obama must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
9108395 mccain and obama are as you probably know ideologically speaking they are completely different nominees for example one offers you hope and the other offers you a dish of hard candy
9108396 the nights big event was obamas speech in front of 75 000 enthusiastic supporters and eight confused broncos season ticket holders
9108397 11 year old vsider who could also be a pedophile
9108398 i believe that i can play a greater role in the larger arena of public education
9108399 thats what i intend to do and i will absolutely keep my hands in the mix both locally and nationally
9108400 i know that in public education being on the ground in the trenches is in my heart in my soul and thats why i ran to be president of the school board
9108401 i believe that the chancellor is taking the appropriate approach in turning the entire organization upside down
9108402 we would like to have had a little bit more involvement
9108403 the connection between education and public life has always been part of who i am
9108404 my fear is that its going to become less policy focused and more political
9108405 weve proved that we can appoint people to the board and they can be great members
9108406 breakdowns in key internal control activities can leave the authority vulnerable to fraudulent abusive or questionable real estate activity
9108407 the county council and the county executive have no role in those transactions or the decisions made by the redevelopment authority board of directors
9108408 they wouldnt let me look at it or respond to it
9108409 im pretty proud of what weve done and the proposals we selected
9108410 reduces the amount of public transparency making it difficult for the agency to maintain the respect trust and confidence of potential developers as well as county citizens
9108411 when we identified that the barriers could be strengthened it became our responsibility to do those repairs immediately
9108412 it is our obligation that when we can make it safer we do so
9108413 my fear is it must be really bad structurally to have them working on it on labor day weekend the busiest traffic weekend of the year
9108414 we certainly sympathize with our commuters especially with those who cant take alternate routes but the decision was made with safety being the number one priority
9108415 or about as close to an embrace as you can get
9108416 he walked with a kind of saunter as if he hadnt a care in the world
9108417 the demand for copper substitutes such as aluminium plastics and fibre has been on the rise last four years and it will increase this year too it is a clear indication that manufacturers are shifting
9108418 no new investment in mineshas been announced of late mining cost has more than doubled
9108419 in my view the subvention given for sugar exports must now come to an end much sugar has been exported now i have spoken to the ministry of agriculture regarding this
9108420 it will lead to exporters defaulting on their commitments and earn a bad name for the country
9108421 the removal of subvention will not have any impact on the domestic prices as they are driven by other factors
9108422 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet meanwhile john mccains wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave
9108423 and now comes proof that mccain has learned to use a computer because evidently he has plagiarized from the internets
9108424 michelle obama must prove she loves america as opposed to republicans who everyone knows love america they just hate half the people living in it
9108425 mccain and obama are as you probably know ideologically speaking they are completely different nominees for example one offers you hope and the other offers you a dish of hard candy
9108426 the nights big event was obamas speech in front of 75 000 enthusiastic supporters and eight confused broncos season ticket holders
9108427 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9108428 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth on his plans
9108429 i simply dont think that the people of florida are gonna say the nominee of our party ought to be a person who on more than one occasion has expressed lack of understanding of our economy at a time when the economy is the number one issue that people are talking about here in the state of florida
9108430 i know that there are some people who think as sen mccain did he said you know some jobs are leaving michigan and theyre not coming back i disagree
9108431 some politicians as i said are more interested in insults than issues
9108432 she is smart vivacious and energetic she tends to oversimplify complex issues has had difficulty delegating authority and clearly has difficulty distinguishing the line between her public responsibilities and private wishes
9108433 her approval ratings are high 65 percent or so but down from 80 percent earlier in her term most alaskans havent watched her as closely as most reporters or legislators if you took a poll of reporters and legislators i expect her approval rating would be down in the teens or twenties
9108434 it is no surprise the american public chose a poodle for obama
9108435 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9108436 ive been so focused on state government i havent really focused much on the war in iraq i heard on the news about the new deployments
9108437 get your news from a spinning globe on a console
9108438 since shes a cheerleader and he played football last year they knew each other socially id heard of him but she introduced me to him there
9108439 i had a young lady last year dang if she didnt birdie no 8 twice and im sitting there going youve got to be kidding me im just trying to make par on the hole
9108440 she birdied it twice erica birdied it today im thinking my goodness it was a hard hole but the good part about it is they dont know theyre hard out here they havent been there enough
9108441 you have to learn to make birdies to score but you also have to learn to keep them
9108442 the best text message i ever got came from a buddy i go fishing with all the time
9108443 hopefully i can keep most of them this week and things will turn out good
9108444 reduced his range of motion in all of the joints by a third and isolated putting to just one movement in the body
9108445 i practiced about three weeks really hard to get ready i putted really bad but im not going to blame it on that because when you go from the side your whole life to facing with a lengthy putter it was 52 inches long it was really bizarre
9108446 if people started off putting this way when they were young they could get good they could really get good
9108447 i would recommend it for people if they get the yips really bad to try it
9108448 i was explaining it the method to him and thought you know we should putt that way too so thats how it got started
9108449 then i found out theyre already doing this dr cook wrote a chapter in a book about it theres a website devoted to this theres unbelievable stuff on youtube with this i got on the website and looked and i was way behind the curve
9108450 he said the best putter hes ever seen including tiger and phil putted this way he doesnt know who the guy is but he wrote it in his putting bible he didnt know his name
9108451 the guy just disappeared in the night pelz said hes the best hes ever seen
9108452 so amazing being here i love being here its totally new experience for me and ill never forget it i can share it with everyone else when i go back
9108453 at first it wasnt that serious things got really worse especially in 2007
9108454 they threatened me i didnt care at first i almost got killed a few times after that my family decided the best thing is to leave our country
9108455 when i first joined iraqi student project everyone was really proud of me everyone had faith in me and i know they are proud of me i want to make them proud and i have no limits
9108456 im not politician im not terrorist and im just a normal guy who wants to live his life and want to study
9108457 it stops at all the red lights and runs at all the green lights
9108458 well at the next light the camel stopped next to two bikers
9108459 it would be a clear sign from the mccain campaign that they were going to be making a very strong bid for the women whom they see up for grabs both the traditional swing independent suburbanites and then the hillary clinton supporters who remain disillusioned
9108460 take their gold burn their homes kill their families and enslave their souls show them no mercy

9108463 hay unanimidad en la decisi n de hacer el referido con excepci n de un miembro que ha decidido inhibirse
9108464 ha sido importante que se le garantice al senador el debido proceso de ley
9108465 no ocup los relojes porque los quiso ocupar no ocup las armas porque las quiso ocupar
9108466 yo entiendo que pronto van a venir acusaciones en contra del senador
9108467 vamos a ver el tiempo dir no me puedo adelantar a la docena de alternativas que pueden surgir yo conf o en que esto se va a solucionar a tiempo
9108468 if that happened to me id say screw you you dont support my new wife thats your problem
9108469 they didnt mean it thats how they are you have to deal with it
9108470 it used to be the guy with the camera in the closest now its gone high tech
9108471 im not one who would attribute it to being man made
9108472 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to the agenda of big oil
9108473 stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago today he has a realistic plan that will curb a plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment
9108474 in every town hall i heard from you that climate change was real and was a serious threat to our environment and national security i think the time is past when we argue about whether climate change is real or not
9108475 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
9108476 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
9108477 this is the completion of mccains shift to the bush energy policy
9108478 the last thing that separated him from bush was his opposition to drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and now hes picked a major supporter of drilling there
9108479 and i think he might come along on anwr if he sees our 2 000 acres for himself
9108480 i dont know how youd take advantage of anwr in an ecological manner and thats one of the reasons why i have opposed drilling up there but as i say i will look at all policies i have in light of this changed economic environment
9108481 though opposes drilling in anwr he continues to examine the issue in light of americas energy needs
9108482 no one has fought harder than palin to open the north slope to more production in the last couple years
9108483 for this day the chicken doth cluck and it clucks for thee
9108484 take their gold burn their homes kill their families and enslave their souls show them no mercy

9108487 uno de los art culos que primero se acaba es el alcohol
9108488 no es un momento de ingerir bebidas alcoh licas necesitan tener la mente alerta porque no sabemos qu tipo de emergencia va a enfrentar o si alguien va a necesitar de su ayuda
9108489 he escuchado gente decir que el gobierno lo est haciendo emitiendo el alerta para mover la econom a eso no es cierto
9108490 cuando comenc a bajar la cuesta iba como a unas 20 millas y el truck lo llevaba cargado de pollo cuando pas la ltima rampa de emergencia me di cuenta de que los frenos no funcionaban y nunca m s pude controlarlo

9108507 la serie no es innovadora ni revolucionaria pero si que
9108508 me ha gustado mucho la serie tampoco es nada del otro mundo pero
9108509 ledcito oskar hola yo tengo el itouch con la version 1 1 3 y ya con el jai
9108510 we just want to get your guys support and just come out and get drunk talk sh at cu fans and watch us kick their a go rams
9108511 well i would say thats certainly not what we want to see happen
9108512 and if youre there youre drinking underage you certainly are going to be at risk for being cited
9108513 a lot of young college age people say things that are irresponsible like that
9108514 well give this young man the benefit of the doubt certainly people have said things like that before
9108515 this year was no different we did emphasize that a bit more
9108516 i would say that johnsons statement is completely not representative of our universities certainly not of our student body
9108517 i saw him run through our parking lot and jump into that car and then take off running behind the shopping center
9108518 he wrote the note on the back of one of his checks that had all his personal information on it
9108519 hes definitely not the brightest criminal that weve come across
9108520 this is the largest theft by a lawyer ive ever seen
9108521 my client is extremely remorseful for what will be inconvenience and what some of his former clients will need to deal with
9108522 my client has been cooperating with the disciplinary counsel and now will cooperate with the rhode island state police when the time is appropriate
9108523 im contacting these people and urging them to explore any legal remedies available i certainly dont want to see anyone lose their home over this
9108524 if mortgages are not being paid a bank could foreclose thats the tragedy of this thing you are talking about some serious harm to these people
9108525 im not saying i know the answers but these are things they have to explore
9108526 from what i understand he has been taking money for quite some time
9108527 but he was able to cover it up by robbing peter to pay paul
9108528 theres no explanation other than its gone im sure over time well get close to what happened
9108529 i intend to try to track that money and see if there is any way to recover it
9108530 disbarred on consent from engaging in the practice of law
9108531 take whatever steps are necessary to protect the clients interests
9108532 client and business accounts and any funds on deposit in those accounts
9108533 well i told all the kids already that i was going to wear this very special dress that i designed and my mamma sewed for me
9108534 a multi year and now likely irreversible decline in oil production from the region
9108535 with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time
9108536 last night one of the models took hanna basically right where gustav makes landfall only four days later
9108537 we want to focus on helping bridge the gap of u s vehicles traveling to the iss international space station as efficiently as possible
9108538 the e mail is premature the parameters of the study have not yet been defined
9108539 continuing to fly the shuttle beyond 2010 does not enhance u s human spaceflight capability but rather delays the time until a new capability exists and increases the total life cycle cost to bring the new capability on line
9108540 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9108541 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9108542 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9108543 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9108544 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9108545 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9108546 were supposed to be a world class company but they dont want to give us a world class contract
9108547 the film came to us in december 2005 but we had asked him to get a no objection certificate from sonia gandhi
9108548 i guess we are talking about it today but if i win the title you forget about it again
9108549 thats usually how it goes i was struggling to see the ball at the net a little bit he did well to scramble back for quite a few balls
9108550 it was kind of a difficult mentality but it was actually fun playing this well and really got the crowd into it i was never in danger and so it was actually a pretty good match for me
9108551 i dont care if you can do makeup or not
9108552 the only reason you got the job here is because youre hot
9108553 i will come and go as i please and make my own hours
9108554 i will be able to spend more time with my friends and family
9108555 i will have plenty of money to do what i want
9108556 5 simple and easy steps to put your marketing on autopilot
9108557 this is a very dangerous storm make no mistake about that
9108558 we want people to really be thinking about what theyre doing this weekend
9108559 we prepare for the worst and pray for the best
9108560 we will continue to watch the storm closely and ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate
9108561 if one stops moving for a certain time we know to send the department of public safety out to see why
9108562 weve got a steady stream of people filling up i think people are thinking about getting out early this time
9108563 rasanya luar biasa dapat bergabung dengan fulham ini adalah masa masa menyenangkan di klub dan saya telah bergabung untuk menjadi bagian penting dari kesuksesan fulham di masa depan

9108569 bro ah you know you have to renew road tax right but this is old car above 15 years old so got 50 surcharge so the road tax adds up to 1400 a year
9108570 oh yes you have to settle your insurance first before i can transfer you
9108571 if you dont let me buy an old car to drive how to have experience
9108572 kelvin youre still a p plate holder dangerous for p plate holder to drive
9108573 the p plate signifies that you have just passed your license and that means that you just came out from the driving school not long ago if you dont drive for a time lapse of say 1 year so that you are no longer a p plate holder
9108574 kelvin youre 19 and covering anyone under 21 costs significantly more
9108575 that 19 years old and 21 year old crap is

9108629 the truth is that the choice is not between a dead mechanism and a rigid automatism on the one hand and conscious planning on the other hand the alternative is not plan or no plan the question is whose planning should each member of society plan for himself or should the paternal government alone plan for all the issue is not automatism versus conscious action it is spontaneous action of each individual versus the exclusive action of the government it is freedom versus government omnipotence

9108632 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

9108640 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9108641 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9108642 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

9108649 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9108650 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9108660 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9108661 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9108662 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9108663 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9108664 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9108665 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9108666 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano
9108667 sar un presidente ha detto che guarda al futuro e non al passato ma ricordatevi queste elezioni non sono su di me ma riguardano voi tutti
9108668 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9108669 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9108670 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9108671 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9108672 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9108673 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica
9108674 una riforma organica che non sia rivolta contro qualcuno ma guardi agli interessi dei cittadini
9108675 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9108676 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9108677 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9108678 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9108679 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9108680 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9108681 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9108690 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9108691 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9108692 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9108693 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9108694 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9108695 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9108696 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9108697 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9108698 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9108699 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9108703 the farming industry has got to be congratulated on achieving a huge level of vaccination
9108704 that was key and everybody has worked very very hard to achieve that
9108705 a normal vaccine would take seven eight even 12 years to develop
9108706 in this particular case we managed to develop it in under two years
9108707 now that was because we recognised the importance of needing a vaccine quickly

9108738 following up to the capital budget the final adoption is set for tomorrow at 7 30 at town hall the proposed total for year one is 7 700 000 the original request from the town manager was 8 111 000 the reduction represents 411 000 or about 5 not nearly enough to have any serious impact on spending and still a very large appropriation i have drafted and attached a list of projects where i have objections and thus will not be supporting the capital budget this year it may not become a formal proposal tomorrow night but at least you can see how i and the republican caucus are trying to save money and make better use of your tax dollars especially in difficult times our proposal would reduce spending by 1 3 million dollars including a 700 000 reduction simply by removing the plans to install air conditioning piping at the high school this is a sticking point with me there is no need for ac in the high school and i cant ask taxpayers to pay for it and if this project moves forward in later years it could lead to the installation of the final ac components costing even more more on this later but thankfully you will have the chance to vote this down at referendum and demand that a regular heating system be installed never mind the ac there are good projects in the capital plan which i support such as road work however i cant ask residents to support unnecessary spending we can try to carve out some of the excess but in the end the budget is likely to pass as omnibus package of 20 capital projects a total one year cost of 7 7 million dollars and a 5 year cost of just over 41 000 000 please take a look at our suggested spending reductions and of course feel free to share your thoughts

9108757 the journalist of the future is going to be someone who is trained from the beginning to be flexible and work in an environment that mixes digital images sound text and the internet as well as traditional newspapers magazines and television and radio broadcasts
9108758 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9108759 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9108760 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9108761 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9108762 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9108763 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9108764 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9108765 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9108766 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9108767 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9108768 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9108769 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9108770 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9108771 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9108772 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9108773 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9108774 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9108775 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9108776 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9108777 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9108778 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9108779 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9108780 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9108781 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9108782 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9108783 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9108784 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9108785 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9108786 who are open to doing something on the production side
9108787 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9108788 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9108789 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9108790 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9108791 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9108792 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9108793 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9108794 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9108795 im not going to allow a political will to tarnish my reputation
9108796 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9108797 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9108798 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9108799 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9108800 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9108801 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9108802 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9108803 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9108804 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9108805 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9108806 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9108807 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9108808 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9108809 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9108810 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9108811 wimsey get your nose out of your tush we paid for that tush and we wont have you messing about with it
9108812 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9108813 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9108814 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9108815 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9108816 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9108817 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9108818 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9108819 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9108820 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9108821 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9108822 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

9108834 ive made a statement that i would like to play a marquee nonconference game one time a year a game that really was significant that our guys got excited about playing
9108835 i had chances i was fighting i wanted so much to win that match but she played unbelievable

9108843 what i need to do is blend what my country wants from me with the different style my club needs from me
9108844 the argentina coach is trying to convert me back into the kind of striker i was before moving to england a dribbler a goalscorer and someone who saved his best for the final third of the pitch
9108845 but playing here in england has taught me to sacrifice myself more for the team
9108846 its hard to achieve both but ive got faith in myself to reinstate bits of my original game into how i perform for club and country
9108847 there is nothing more beautiful to me than seeing argentina play well and win things so i was praying for a gold medal for our boys it will benefit me and manchester united because i treasure playing for my country
9108848 and i know from what ive seen in the olympics that if any of us in the national team rest on our laurels then these brilliant youngsters will have our places its an incentive to work harder and win things all the time
9108849 i know how strongly the youngsters will be pushing us given that the same happened when i won the gold medal in athens
9108850 everything has changed radically for me since then and im signing on for three more years at united because im very happy in england

9108854 the first pitch to encarnacion wasnt a bad pitch a changeup that was kind of flat
9108855 thats really what did us in tonight the defense we just made too many mistakes there gave them too many outs
9108856 we needed this offense for our confidence they helped us out with their defense
9108857 if i cannot find something satisfying here there is a possibility i might end up in japan playing ball

9108865 i doubt any of the players can take their position in the team for granted this season
9108866 we have a squad of 32 players including the goalkeepers and ideally i would love to see two or three players fighting for a place in the main team
9108867 they all know the need to work seriously as this is the first season for us as a professional outfit
9108868 the jew evolved organized capitalism with its working instrumentality the banking system
9108869 yes she is on the eve of her fall your europe of a fall universal general terrible judaism and the banks now reign over everything as much over europe as over education over the whole of civilization and socialism particularly over socialism because with its aid judaism will tear out christianity by the roots and destroy christian culture and if nothing comes of all this but anarchy then even at the head of all will be found the jew and when all the wealth of europe has been pillaged the jew bank alone will remain
9108870 the revolution in russia is a jewish revolution a crisis in jewish history it is a jewish revolution because russia is the home of about half the jews of the world and an overturning of its despotic government must have a very important influence on the destines of the millions living there and on the many thousands who have recently emigrated to other countries but the revolution in russia is a jewish revolution also because jews are the most active revolutionists in the czars empire
9108871 there is much in the fact of bolshevism itself in the fact that so many jews are bolshevists in the fact that the ideals of bolshevism at many points are consonant with the finest ideals of judaism
9108872 over one third of the jews in russia have become officials
9108873 it is now known and clearly proved that the money was provided by a group of international financiers with headquarters in berlin stockholm and new york while lenin took with him from switzerland a number of alien revolutionaries collected from all parts of europe his chief lieutenant trotsky brought with him a horde of aliens from the united states trotsky himself was in prison in halifax nova scotia when the call came for him to join lenin in russia his release from prison so that he might assist lenin in organizing the bolshevik revolution is a mystery that has never been explained what powerful influence compelled the british authorities to order his release and to grant permission for his transport to russia
9108874 obscure international speculator who acquired an enormous fortune and styled himself as the ideal inspirer of bolshevism
9108875 the bolsheviks used to obtain large sums of money from an unknown source abroad
9108876 how the subsidized alien revolutionaries having invaded russia proceeded to murder and rob on a wholesale scale has been recorded by many persons who had the misfortune to be in russia during the bolshevik revolution all are agreed that the leaders of the revolution and the persons responsible for the most brutal and revolting murders were jews
9108877 during the war trotsky edited novy mir and conducted mass meetings in new york when he left the united states to return to russia he is said on good authority to have traveled on schiffs money and under schiffs protection he was captured by the british at halifax and immediately on advice from a highly placed personage set free shortly after his arrival in russia he was informed that he had a credit in sweden at the swedish branch of the bank owned by max warburg of hamburg this credit helped to finance the seizure of the russian revolution by the international jewish bankers
9108878 students of radicalism know that the present soviet government in russia was organized by aliens and usurpers and not representative of the thoughts and ideals of the one hundred and fifty million citizens of russia
9108879 krassin thus played a dual role on one hand representing the interests of the great german jewish capitalists and on the other acting as lieutenant of lenin whose avowed aim was to destroy capitalism if any further evidence were needed of the connection between bolshevism and international finance the case of krassin would provide it
9108880 as long as there are idiots to take our signature serious and to put their trust in it we must promise everything that is asked and as much as one likes if we can only get something tangible in exchange
9108881 did not need any financial assistance and that a large percentage of loans from the united states was lent to russia
9108882 if we are going to do business with russia let us do it directly and not through germany which has arranged to give soviet russia millions of dollars credit to purchase commodities in germany
9108883 please accept on this the seventeenth anniversary of the establishment of the soviet government the assurance of my best wishes for the welfare and prosperity of your country

9108907 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9108908 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9108909 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there

9108947 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9108948 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9108949 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9108950 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9108956 its really always been more than a festival its because people are longing and searching for something all people and when we say take the church outside the walls we mean the message of jesus christ and i think people want to know that theres hope
9108957 it really started because my wife and i went on a missions trip with a group of other people from here we went down to mexico and god spoke to us
9108958 i think its so important that its more than just a big event that we have that we can reach out to these people all year long
9108959 we see the whole slogan of lifelight taking the church outside the walls but its a really serious calling for us so all that time weve always had in mind that the festival is just the launching pad for other year round ministry
9108960 theres a need all over the world theres so many impoverished areas and weve had this platform of the festival and its an opportunity to use that platform to tell the church and those beyond of the needs all over the world
9108961 but whats happened with those areas of ministry is god has brought us people who have a heart to do those areas
9108962 and weve now partnered with food for the hungry so weve gone to places like africa and bangladesh taking people to see the kids that theyve sponsored
9108963 if were called to do festivals than were also called to connect the rest of the dots i guess the what next question
9108964 the more people we can reach for christ the better whether its in a student led club on a high school campus or across the world in africa wherever we have the chance to go were not going to say no if gods taking us there well say yes

9109040 thats the hardest part for all of us you see this brilliant life taken before us and trying to explain why it happened
9109041 i think it would be our duty to go out and play as hard as we can for him
9109042 its tough its definitely tough he was such a good guy its definitely a heartbreaker to this community and definitely for this football team
9109043 we got here as early as we could got here before five oclock already and got the parking lot kids situated with the tailgating over there and as the lot is full now weve got on the street donig the best we can to keep traffic moving
9109044 we came right in found a spot parked and came right on in not a problem
9109045 i think its gone better than we thought it would so far

9109049 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues
9109050 has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge
9109051 the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd
9109052 the use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
9109053 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole
9109054 at fixed times and if necessary more frequently they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark
9109055 what existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
9109056 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain
9109057 we must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust but we put up with it because we are not convinced at the moment that anyone has invented a better system the alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate injustice is preferable to total ruin
9109058 the entire spirit of capitalist production which is oriented towards the most immediate monetary profits stands in contradiction to agriculture which has to concern itself with the whole gamut of permanent conditions of life required by the chain of human generations
9109059 hardins fable was taken up by the gathering forces of neo liberal reaction in the 1970s and his essay became the scientific foundation of world bank and imf policies viz enclosure of commons and privatization of public property the message is clear we must never treat the earth as a common treasury we must be ruthless and greedy or else we will perish
9109060 these large amounts of land with their attendant natural resources will never yield their maximum benefit to canadas native people as long as they are held as collective property subject to political management collective property is the path of poverty and private property is the path of prosperity

9109065 its everything its game week its preparing for a game its getting mentally focused for a game its knowing everything is possible then theres the hotel the walk through then we get here and do the gator walk here then we prepare for the game at the swamp then we go play
9109066 the atmosphere i love the crowd the team theres something about game day that keeps you going
9109067 i love running out on the field going against an opponent before the game i love the whole experience of driving over here as a freshman i actually cried a little bit when i first drove over here the gator walk its all a great experience
9109068 the gator walk something about that is just overwhelming that youre here at florida i never thought id be here coming down and seeing all the fans here thats when you know its game time
9109069 just the atmosphere of the whole game being here in gator nation has really made me even more anxious to play in the games because ive been here in the fall and seen what the atmosphere is like its one of the craziest atmospheres around
9109070 as doc rivers said during champions day youre investing youre investing and then you go withdraw its your pay day and obviously were awfully fortunate for playing where we get to play thats why kids come here to play in games like this
9109071 you get to go out and hit someone else you practice so long and youve met for so long now you wait through spring ball and now is the time to see what they really can do and you have a chance to watch them its just fun to see if youve really prepared them and they are ready to go play for you
9109072 its a culmination of a lot of work when you get to game day its like lets go play and game day should be easier than practice and thats really the mantra for us what we go by work work work push em push em push em game day enjoy it because its not going to be anything like practice is its going to be a lot more fun
9109073 america comes alive when college football season starts we all know that i cant wait weve been out here in the winter and the spring and the summer and walk throughs and ive never been here on game day but this is what its all about the enthusiasm the passion the emotion the students the fans ive seen this place on television ive lost track of how many times ive watched florida on tv and i finally get to walk out here as a coach its pretty special
9109074 just running in the stadium the crowd the electricity that flows around this place theres nothing like it
9109075 you get up early watch espn and read the gainesville sun and there is this buzz in the air from the grocery store to the gas station to the stadium its also about me overestimating the time i need to be tailgating and always getting to the stadium way too early
9109076 game day is game weekend for us friday night we go downtown and walk around we eat there and see people we know saturday we go to publix and then park and go to the gator walk we go to emerson hall and tijuana flats and then into the stadium its a ritual there is so much energy in gainesville and its great to see the gator nation come together
9109077 its family fun and fellowship we get to our parking at 8 with a bunch of friends no matter what time the game is we have the tailgate catered its grown into a huge production whats great is my two daughters who are 14 and 11 cant wait that gives me goose bumps ill tell you those seven saturdays are probably my favorite seven days of the year
9109078 it means i get to fly my orange and blue plane to gainesville stay at magnolia plantation and go the game early so were in our seats when they go here come the gators the great thing about going to gainesville is that i get a year older and they stay the same age there are two kinds of game day the blowouts and the tight games im a ball of nerves for the big games i love the blowouts
9109079 it means everything i grew up in gainesville and theres just nothing else like it its exciting theres a look in everybodys eyes its an intangible feeling that is difficult to describe i love it
9109080 i really feel the ladies were prepared coming into the game and it showed in their execution
9109081 im proud of the team as i really feel it was a complete team effort
9109082 we played hard whole and were fighting the entire game
9109083 i think it was clear that we wanted it more we wanted the win
9109084 melanie along with the rest of the team is playing hard for each other and it is really showing
9109085 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
9109086 so far this year 62 children were shot after curfew
9109087 if they were in their home that probably wouldnt have happened
9109088 this gave us a chance to speak with the children about the dangers of being out past hours as well as their parents

9109130 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to the agenda of big oil
9109131 stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago today he has a realistic plan that will curb a plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment
9109132 in every town hall i heard from you that climate change was real and was a serious threat to our environment and national security i think the time is past when we argue about whether climate change is real or not
9109133 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
9109134 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth while the scope and long term consequences of this warming effect are the subject of ongoing research we believe the united states should take measured and reasonable steps today
9109135 this is the completion of mccains shift to the bush energy policy
9109136 the last thing that separated him from bush was his opposition to drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and now hes picked a major supporter of drilling there
9109137 and i think he might come along on anwr if he sees our 2 000 acres for himself
9109138 i dont know how youd take advantage of anwr in an ecological manner and thats one of the reasons why i have opposed drilling up there but as i say i will look at all policies i have in light of this changed economic environment
9109139 though opposes drilling in anwr he continues to examine the issue in light of americas energy needs

9109144 humans only truly unite when faced with a powerful external enemy
9109145 at this time a new enemy must be found one either real or invented for the purpose
9109146 democracy has failed us a new system of global governance based on environmental imperatives must be implemented quickly
9109147 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself
9109148 democracy is not a panacea it cannot organize everything and it is unaware of its own limits these facts must be faced squarely sacrilegious though this may sound democracy is no longer well suited for the tasks ahead the complexity and the technical nature of many of todays problems do not always allow elected representatives to make competent decisions at the right time
9109149 all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behaviour that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself
9109150 the greatest hope for the earth lies in religionists and scientists uniting to awaken the world to its near fatal predicament and then leading mankind out of the bewildering maze of international crises into the future utopia of humanist hope
9109151 the gaiamind project is dedicated to exploring the idea that we humanity are t
9109152 the project has been designed to be both interdisciplinary and inter institutional it operates under the aegis of the institute of noetic sciences a 501 c 3 research entity which will manage the funding for the project
9109153 the vision for creating the institute of noetic sciences came in 1971
9109154 the presence of divinity became almost palpable and i knew that life in the universe was not just an accident based on random processes the knowledge came to me directly
9109155 at the institute of noetic sciences we employ the rigor of science balanced by personal and collective wisdom to support a shift in consciousness that transforms present global conditions into a world grounded in freedom wisdom and love we serve an emerging movement of globally conscious citizens dedicated to manifesting our highest capacities
9109156 the resultant ideal sustainable population is hence more than 500 million but less than one billion

9109205 i had they yips on my serve i have no idea where it came from
9109206 i just never felt comfortable out there and i was trying so hard to get back in the set was able to do that then played one of the worst games of my career at 5 5 thats the way it goes
9109207 i clawed my way through not playing great and made it competitive its just a shame i had all the momentum

9109332 we just didnt know how much better eighty two wins is a big moment and i want this to be the standard of what we do to get that number on an annual basis
9109333 youve got to break through the barrier eventually weve done it now lets move on down the road
9109334 its been a great season and were showing no signs of letting up
9109335 theyre on a roll right now theyre playing very well at home
9109336 at the same time it doesnt mean i cant pitch well
9109337 i asked for six innings and i got exactly what i asked for
9109338 he did what he had to do he went out there and he made pitches
9109339 its good to go out there every fifth game and feel good
9109340 im not exactly going out there and being totally dominant
9109341 after all his injuries to be able to get two wins this year i think he feels pretty good
9109342 all these remaining games were doing what we have to do
9109343 just the one pitch where the first run scored that was not where i wanted it
9109344 we didnt score early but we scored when the team needed it the most
9109345 i was thinking i just need to come through right here and at least tie the game
9109346 i knew it was going to be gone and i was happy because this is a team we really need to beat
9109347 theyre playing good baseball and i screwed it up my last few outings have been horrible
9109348 we keep the team in the game because we understand we have a really good offense
9109349 remember when we went to ss house for dinner and boo didnt want to eat etc
9109350 you know except for the part where you were in the coma mom because even my teacher gave me a cool present and she never gives anyone presents
9109351 wow imagine what sort of cool gifts you could have gotten if id died
9109352 if you think about it its just in passing like oh thatd be nice to hit one one of these days
9109353 im sure if you play long enough youre going to
9109354 guys have been giving me a hard time all year about not having a walkoff
9109355 i go around and ive got to listen to it every time we go into extra innings now i guess theyll have to pick something else
9109356 it never crossed my mind it was going out of the park
9109357 they could grab somebody out of the stands and he could throw a good game against us it seems like everybody they run out there every time is tough
9109358 i happened to make one bad pitch and it cost us the lead
9109359 i was telling the guys i remember the day when i was able to hit and field my position so i dont know whats going on
9109360 facing years in jail for a conviction of a single particular charge
9109361 in fact all the charges were municipal court violations that do not carry such penalties
9109362 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer witness or arrestee on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
9109363 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
9109364 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
9109365 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
9109366 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
9109367 the wretch gets additionally receipt in other respects subconscious self deserves
9109368 i asked for six innings and i got exactly what i asked for
9109369 he did what he had to do he went out there and he made pitches
9109370 its good to go out there every fifth game and feel good
9109371 im not exactly going out there and being totally dominant
9109372 after all his injuries to be able to get two wins this year i think he feels pretty good
9109373 all these remaining games were doing what we have to do
9109374 just the one pitch where the first run scored that was not where i wanted it
9109375 this year will not be a year of politics as usual it can be a year of inspiration and hope and it will be a year of concern of quiet and sober reassessment of our nations character and purpose it has already been a year when voters have confounded the experts and i guarantee you that it will be the year when we give the government of this country back to the people of this country there is a new mood in america we have been shaken by a tragic war abroad and by scandals and broken promises at home our people are searching for new voices and new ideas and new leaders
9109376 i think we worry about going out there and getting better every single day we cant take any backward steps
9109377 lets focus on illinois and getting better every day thats pretty much all we talk about
9109378 it was the first start for a lot of guys last year the atmosphere and the whole st louis thing
9109379 guys were just a little nervous and thats how it happened
9109380 well come out there this year and try to finish the game
9109381 hes been labeled as an option quarterback but now hes a passer
9109382 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9109383 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9109384 we are one of the 13 counties in the whole united states that a democrat must win must win to get elected president and i think thats one of the main reasons why theyre here
9109385 i guess they call it the yips on your serve
9109386 probably came from all my years making fun of people that had it that was my karma coming back
9109387 all i know is i have doubles at 2 30 tomorrow
9109388 i think its tough to make any kind of decision in a rash moment and there was no decision made before the tournament so you know i dont think its time to make a certain statement now
9109389 at the end maybe she was a bit tired said bartoli who hits two handed off both wings
9109390 yips she double faulted on the tiebreakers opening point and this time there was no recovery davenport slapped a forehand into the net on bartolis third match point then chucked her racket to the sideline
9109391 it was some of my least great tennis out there davenport said
9109392 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9109393 by her being on that berlin heart it saved her life
9109394 it bought us more time you can live on a berlin heart over 365 days while we were waiting on a heart
9109395 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and i had a season coming up
9109396 im not going to lie it was hard some days i would sit in my room and just think what am i doing here i would feel guilty for being at work and not being at the hospital with my kid i had those days
9109397 as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9109398 were just glad that it seems like its going to have a happy ending
9109399 you talk about real men and being a father and husband ive had a chance to see him go through a lot of different things and he just stepped up to the plate
9109400 my wife would get on these blog sites and stuff like that and people were wondering why i wasnt at practice
9109401 someone said i was getting traded for brett favre one blog said i hit my wife and one blog said i got arrested for drinking and driving it was a bunch of crazy stuff
9109402 i think probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9109403 the biggest thing that i got out of it is youre taking something negative and making it into a positive instead of having just two negatives
9109404 we obviously didnt finish the season the way we wanted to last year this is another opportunity another year to erase those negative thoughts
9109405 peoples perceptions they roll with that stuff over and over and you just have to try and keep a level head about it all
9109406 it wasnt the kind of ball striking i would have liked to have had said irwin the 2005 winner
9109407 there were a few fakeouts but its good not to get too exasperated its a relatively short course with a few silly shots
9109408 any time you shoot 66 at pebble beach you should be satisfied said bean who birdied three of the final four holes
9109409 there are a lot of guys out there whod like to shoot 66
9109410 it started out like it was going to be an uneventful round said bean who eagled no
9109411 i missed a few early putts but i played a very solid round in 32 years of playing here it was one of the better rounds ive played
9109412 ive been playing very very well for the last month and a half zoeller said
9109413 its kind of exciting again im doing everything right right now im driving the ball well and im hitting some pretty good irons and giving myself opportunities

9109419 the conflict between the opposites can strain our psyche to the breaking point if we take them seriously or if they take us seriously
9109420 to struggle against paranoia is to defend multiplicity and differences as founding conditions for the exercise of the cultivation of the soul the love for images
9109421 what do these things mean and whom do they serve when life is perceived in the context of tyranny meaning and freedom are lost and rebellion is aroused we may feel we are personally targeted but arent we all the target in the psychophysical psyops war that is 21st century life
9109422 psychology cannot be fully separated from religion religion as relation with divinity and as relation with community where psychology is drawn to consider theology and politics
9109423 if john mccain is the answer then the question must be ridiculous
9109424 over the years our approach to investigative problems in the intelligence field has given rise to a number of new programs some of which have been most revolutionary and it can be assumed that with a continued aggressive approach to these problems new and productive ideas will be forthcoming these ideas will not be increased in number or improved upon from the standpoint of accomplishments merely through the institution of a program such as cointelpro which is given another name and which in fact only encompasses everything that has been done or will be done in the future
9109425 it appears that the cia fbi and nsa are now sending their goons into the metaphysical marketplace making sure that people who think they are aspiring to higher and positively transformative things are in reality only becoming more self indulgent disconnected and confused

9109427 i can understand why the fans wouldnt know what to expect because in some respect the coaches dont either
9109428 we know a lot more because weve been around in practice so i dont want to say we are going into this thing totally blind because we are not
9109429 weve been practicing for several weeks now still until you put them in a game situation you dont know for sure how certain players are going to react particularly the freshmen
9109430 we might be a little under the radar but were still michigan
9109431 its michigan but theyre still a division i program just like us
9109432 they may be the best team since urbans team went to the bcs
9109433 they have a very athletic quarterback who runs the spread that weve had problems against in the past they have explosive players and they have some of the fastest corners well play against
9109434 this is in aid of the people not of elections this is for development and not for the 2010 polls
9109435 when i take that walk to the ring to fight oscar i will carry all the people of the philippines the entire country on my shoulders
9109436 i have to find a way to increase my speed
9109437 were three months away and we have to figure out quick how were going to neutralize him its going to be an explosive fight were going to fight in the center of the ring
9109438 i have no intention of taking it easy in the gym because this will be the fastest strongest southpaw ive ever faced
9109439 i promise i will fight with all of my heart and that i will give everything i have
9109440 i am faster and stronger than him and im also younger hes bigger in height but i feel im stronger and its going to be a great fight
9109441 manny pacquiao is considered the best fighter in boxing today and i always want to fight the best
9109442 my focus is on my training and my next fight
9109443 im not going to talk or think about retirement well see how i feel after this fight for now i have to focus on my training
9109444 i am glad we were able to make this fight happen because while pacquiao is at the pinnacle of his success and has defeated all of the top fighters he has faced i am going to show the world that it stops with me
9109445 i want the loudest and the biggest dog in the pound
9109446 lets just say my foot got caught in the door
9109447 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight
9109448 i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer like that
9109449 he knows my style and he knows mannys and for him to say that was a big challenge
9109450 i think my legacy is already cemented you cant take away what i have achieved in the ring
9109451 we have to clutch at points of certainty and that is the tripoli agreement and the 1996 agreement and all other subsequent agreements that can be made as terms of reference
9109452 while at the same time we cannot proceed on the other side on the milf because we dont know what their position is
9109453 we begin by going back to the 1996 peace agreement i dont think well have a problem within the mnlf what were trying to do is complete the obligations for everyone and ensure compliance of everyone to the terms of the agreement
9109454 countenancing or non countenancing of atrocities committed by some of its members
9109455 our message to the milf is to surrender bravo and kato if they dont we will get them
9109456 we would like to say that there is no truth to that the mnlf remains to be a partner of the national government in the implementation of peace and development for many many years until today
9109457 there was no consultation with the mnlf we were not party to the talks we were not involved we are not opposed also to the peace efforts of the government
9109458 as to when finally there will be an agreement with government and the milf if it will work how it will work with the present agreement between the mnlf and the government ask the government because we have to harmonize if ever there will be an agreement
9109459 we changed our constitution five times in history why cant we change our constitution now to achieve peace
9109460 the proposed moa should go through a plebiscite and the sc should make sure of that congress should also do that
9109461 this could have been prevented things should not have flared up we were at the stage of having to sign the moa people thought that we gave them milf the moon and the stars but people never understood that it was a rollercoaster ride
9109462 we have done their work we consulted the lumads indigenous people in mindanao we even consulted the pi ols and the lobregats unfortunately the pi ols have prevailed
9109463 we consulted them unfortunately some of them have denied this in drafting this moa we want to enter the shoes of the other person its not that we abandoned our constituents
9109464 not be signed in its present form or in any other form
9109465 from a legal standpoint you have the moa initialed by the panel and if you withdraw the tro that initial means that under international law they are compelled to sign it
9109466 because if it had been signed it would have been a binding international obligation malaysia can compel us to change our constitution
9109467 you see the danger that could have happened had that moa been signed you are risking dismemberment of the country on your conjecture that thats not an international obligation
9109468 you mean to say you asked them to witness an event that has no legal significance
9109469 why are there many versions of the actions of the president why is its language changing
9109470 no matter what the sc decides the government will not sign moa
9109471 since it wont be signed it has been set aside but not the peace process
9109472 this moa is hardly recognizable international law and standards we cant even reach a proper characterization
9109473 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9109474 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9109475 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9109476 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9109477 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9109478 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9109479 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9109480 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9109481 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9109482 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9109483 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9109484 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9109485 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9109486 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9109487 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
9109488 masalahnya tidak ada pelaburan baru pengurusan yang lembab dan rasuah tidak ditangani
9109489 kalau kos mngendalikan satu satu projek rm40 bilion rm 10 bilion hilang di tengah jalan ini yang menjadi masalah besar
9109490 maka dia cuba memberi sedikit sebanyak gula gula untuk riang sabah sarawak dan orang orang miskin
9109491 sebaliknya beliau lupa bahawa peningkatan kos sara hiduo dan inflasi begitu melonjak tinggi
9109492 maknanya kalau diberi rm100 atau rm500 tidak sepadan dengan kenaikan kos harga barang dan minyak
9109493 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9109494 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9109495 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9109496 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9109497 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9109498 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9109499 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9109500 sesungguhnya allah memerintah supaya kamu menunaikan amanah kepada ahlinya dan apabila kamu menjalankan hukum di kalangan manusia hendaklah melaksanakan hukum itu dengan adil sesungguhnya allah memberi pengajaran yang sebaik baiknya kepada kamu sesungguhnya allah sentiasa mendengar lagi sentiasa melihat wahai orang orang yamng beriman taatlah kamu kepada allah dan taatlah kamu kepada rasul dan ulil amri orang orang yang mengendalikan urusan yang terdiri daripada pemimpin dan ulamak maka jika sekiranya kamu bertelingkah dalam apa apa perkara hendaklah kamu kembalikan penyelesaiannya kepada allah al quran dan rasul as sunnah jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari akhirat itulah sebaik baik dan lebih elok penyelesaiannya
9109501 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9109502 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9109503 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9109504 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9109505 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9109506 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9109507 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9109508 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

9109522 can cause changes in behavior and the brain prostate gland mammary gland and the age at which females attain puberty
9109523 these studies only provide limited evidence for adverse effects on development and more research is needed to better understand their implications for human health
9109524 however because these effects in animals occur at bisphenol a exposure levels similar to those experienced by humans the possibility that bisphenol a may alter human development cannot be dismissed
9109525 provide reassurance that consumers can continue to use products made from bisphenol a
9109526 the limited evidence for effects in laboratory animals at low doses primarily highlights opportunities for additional research to better understand whether these findings are of any significance to human health
9109527 reflects a significant body of science showing that bpa may play a larger role than previously thought in a host of common health problems including prostate cancer breast cancer and early puberty
9109528 the bottom line is there really is a convergence of opinion that is occurring

9109535 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9109536 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9109537 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9109538 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9109539 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9109540 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9109541 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9109542 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9109543 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9109544 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9109545 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9109546 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9109547 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9109548 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9109549 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

9109555 those who reject truth among the people of the book and the polytheists were not going to depart from their ways until there comes to them clear evidence a messenger from allah rehearsing pure scriptures wherein are upright laws or decrees nor did those who had been given the scripture make schisms until after there had come to them clear evidence and they were not commanded except to worship allah sincere in religion to him to establish regular prayer and to pay zakah and that is the upright religion those who reject truth among the people of the book and the polytheists will be in the fire of hell dwelling therein forever they are the worst of creatures
9109556 those reject truth among the people of the book are the polytheists will be in the fire of hell dwelling there therein forever they are the worst of creatures
9109557 but those who reject our signs and treat them with arrogance they are the companions of the fire dwelling therein forever

9109561 those who conceal what we have sent down of proofs and guidance after we have made it clear to the people in the scripture those are cursed by allah and cursed by those who are entitled to curse

9109563 it will be said to the two angels throw into hellfire every obstinate rejecter of allah who prevented good transgressed and doubted who set up another god besides allah throw him into the severe punishment
9109564 and whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is hell to abide therein forever and the warth and the curse of alllah is upon him and he has prepared for him a great punishment
9109565 those who presect or draw into temptations the believers men and women and then do not turn in repentance will have the punishment of hell and they will have the punishment of the burning fire

9109567 the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam said the inhabitants of hell are five 1 the weak who lack self restraint who follow blindly and do not care for family or property i e they care neither for the benefits of the hereafter nor of this world 2 the treacherous who does not show himself but his greed is such that he is deceitful even in small things 3 a person who would betray you morning and evening regarding your family and your property he also made mention of 4 the miser of the liar and 5 one who is in the habit of abusing people and using obscene and foul language
9109568 i looked into paradise and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were the poor and i looked into hell and saw that the majority of its inhabitants were women
9109569 i stood at the gate of paradise and saw that the majority of the people who entered it were the poor while those of means were held for account except the companions of the fire who were already ordered to be taken to the fire and i stood at the gate of the fire and saw that the majority of those who entered it were women
9109570 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9109571 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom

9109576 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9109577 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9109578 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9109579 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

9109594 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9109595 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9109596 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9109597 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9109598 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

9109649 sit down and write a letter to clear up the confusion
9109650 folding up for us means a goodly number of these horses will have to be put to death

9109654 i would like to have every one of those guys who attacked my farm go out with me to recover these animals and see the damage theyve done

9109677 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
9109678 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it

9109680 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
9109681 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
9109682 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
9109683 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi

9109690 ill tell you my fellow americans i am just so impressed with the several hours ive spent with the governor and with my schedule and frequent naps a few hours is a major commitment so i know her as well as i know anyone save perhaps those godless bastards that held me captive all those years providing me with horrific memories memories that no one dare bring up as a reason not to elect me to the most powerful job on earth
9109691 its true my fellow americans that you have to really look far and wide to find a republican and an american like this to find an american like this my fellow americans you have to actually leave america for a while and drive through canada and then to a place that is pure white all year round and where its always a twilight of cotton candy

9109844 food waste in this country is an environmental and financial disaster when you consider that we are throwing away at least one out of five bags of groceries every time we go shopping we might as well throw away the money it was bought with
9109845 whereas once peoples relationship with food was one of saving and reusing leftovers food has now become a part of the throw away society we live in and heres something else dee says that we should really take note of
9109846 when food waste rots in landfill it produces methane a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than the co2 pouring out of your cars exhaust if we dont mend our wasteful ways well be eating ourselves out of an environment that can sustainably support future generations of australians

9109876 the farming industry has got to be congratulated on achieving a huge level of vaccination
9109877 that was key and everybody has worked very very hard to achieve that
9109878 a normal vaccine would take seven eight even 12 years to develop
9109879 in this particular case we managed to develop it in under two years
9109880 now that was because we recognised the importance of needing a vaccine quickly

9109900 we represented the buyer of a business the buyer paid a pretty nice price for the assets part of the purchase price was to be paid in monthly payments over the course of several years the payments were not co extensive with the term of the non compete but there were pretty close our client paid monthly for a couple of years our client then learned that the seller was involved with a competing company we filed a lawsuit against the seller for violating the non compete the seller filed a counterclaim after the client stopped making the monthly payments the lesson here for buyers is that you should keep your ears and eyes open your seller might comply with a non compete for several years but might then violate it the lesson here for sellers is that you shouldnt agree to a non compete unless you are willing to abide by its terms

9109932 this was a very emotional soccer match with two teams battling hard all night
9109933 there were several momentum swings in the game we went up right before the half and they came back and got the equalizer and went ahead the difference between this week and last week was that we not only kept playing hard all the way to the end but we battled even harder and showed a lot of guts for 20 minutes in overtime we definitely made some progress
9109934 for a freshman to step up and get a goal when we needed it not once but twice was great to see
9109935 they had a very compact defense there was no open space in the midfield and no space behind gunter played really well and made some big saves in some crucial moments
9109936 sometimes you have a good tie sometimes a bad one in this case we were faced with adversity not only did we equalize at the end of regulation but we really took it to them in overtime we can feel good about this one and move on from here
9109937 i truly believe that people like myself who are in a position of entertainers in the limelight should keep their mouth shut on politics

9109945 the short term lockups could hold prisoners for up to four hours where they would be finger printed photographed and have a dna sample taken they would allow beat bobbies to remove offenders from circulation without spending too long off the street themselves offenders held in the cells could then either be released with a fine or referred for further action or charging
