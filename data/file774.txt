7740003 its journalism in the sense that subediting the paper is an important component but we do believe for a range of structural and other reasons that we can be more productive and itll have absolutely no impact on the quality of the papers
7740004 no were not its not within our control but we have a very constructive and open relationship with the staff and weve communicated directly with them
7740005 these sort of cuts by corporate management at one of australias largest companies is going to have a very serious affect on the quality of the journalism thats produced by the companys papers and websites and magazines
7740006 i think the really important question here is the sort of damage this is going to do the company for a bit of short term benefit a bit of short term cost saving
7740007 you cant produce the sort of quality product that are so essential in this day and age by cutting costs
7740008 dont take my word for it whats rupert murdoch doing hes not engaging in these sort of short sighted cost cutting measures hes investing in journalism and its only by investing in journalism that companies can position themselves for the long term

7740043 prince john adopts a similar pose ken related the story of accompanying ollie to the white house in 2005 where he was the first animator to receive the national medal of arts the most touching aspect of the experience according to ken was not the medal rather the moment in which his father told glen keane recalls what it was like to work under this animation master the discussion of ollie as master animator was overseen by those artists who came to the studio in the 1970s such as brad bird together these men defined not only ollies philosophical understanding of craft but also the airy and subtle grace of his rough drawings lastly leonard maltin introduced a half dozen men who shared ollies lifelong enthusiasm for steam trains michael broggie whose father worked for walt disney grew up at the studio he explained how ollies backyard locomotive helped inspire walt to build a similar scale railroad in his own backyard without ollie michael suggested there might never have been a railroad in walts backyard and without that railroad there might not have been disneyland for me the ollie johnston tribute held a double sadness ollie johnston was the last of the walts nine old men those animators he most trusted at the studio the other eight have already passed on in fact most all of the disney animators from the 1930s have left us bill justice who joined disney in 1937 might be the only one left but the loss of ollie was greater than that of a single man it was the loss of a craft though the work and teachings of ollie johnston will continue to inspire young animators well into the future the world of animation has changed since ollie retired from the studio ollies brand of character based animation was a highly personal art even casual observers of animation can recognize the difference in a scene drawn by ollie johnston and a scene in the same movie drawn by another animator such as ken anderson because a single animator oversaw an entire scene or often a sequence of scenes the artists idiosyncratic drawing style graced each pose each movement fantasia

7740086 many fish are hard to tell apart once theyve been filleted and packaged
7740087 we hope our work lights the way to getting mislabelled and endangered fish species out of grocery store refrigerators and frying pans
7740088 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
7740089 we are not certain where the mislabelling occurs but it seems it is not the fishermen since the mislabelled fish are from completely different parts of the world
7740090 perhaps the mislabelling occurs somewhere in the middle when the fish are filleted and no longer easily identifiable

7740218 i couldnt get too much because he wasnt here and whatever i picked out would be wrong
7740219 some people really give us their junk which is sad some of it does get tossed
7740220 i dont know if people are doing it for the benefit of the tax writeoff or theyre just generous or they dont know what they have
7740221 we got a kitchen sink once so then we couldnt say everything but the kitchen sink
7740222 saya masih mengatakan relatif kecil terjadi tsunami mungkin kalau diatas 6 8 sr ada kemungkinan tsunami

7740224 for ldre samarbejdet er et af de omr der man kan g re en indsats p s b rnene kan forts tte udviklingen derhjemme
7740225 der er blandt andet sket en stigning i antallet af kommuner der kun informerer for ldrene p dansk
7740226 det betyder rigtig rigtig meget for barnets trivsel det p dagogiske sigte og for den f lles indsats at der er et godt samarbejde med for ldrene jo bedre kendskabet til familien er jo lettere er det at stimulere barnet men det kan v re vanskeligt at f etableret en t t relation til for ldrene n r det mest er i afhentningssituationer man ser dem og s rligt hvis man ikke taler samme sprog
7740227 men tolkeprioriteringen er der blevet sk ret meget ned p i kommunerne og det er meget rgerligt for relationen mellem hjem og institution
7740228 sprogstimulering for tosprogede b rn er et omr de der er i v kst og som har regeringens bev genhed vi har l bende fokus p nye initiativer der er ogs lige blevet skabt et visiteringsmateriale der skaber et fysisk m de med barnet hvor for ldrene forh bentlig ogs er til stede
7740229 det er afg rende at f skabt et godt samarbejde til for ldrene
7740230 id hate to lower it and have to raise it again later
7740231 we can afford that we could even look at it again in two years and possibly reduce it again
7740232 i like the thought process of doing what we can but doing it in a controlled way
7740233 id hate to lower it and have to raise it again later
7740234 if our revenues exceed our expenses were taking in too much money
7740235 great seminar i will come back next year and bring my friends
7740236 thanks for providing this im encouraged and excited to take action toward improving my financial situation
7740237 thanks to the sponsors for a great service to oklahoma women i will recommend the conference to all my friends
7740238 excellent conference great price nice people will attend next year
7740239 how does it make you feel to do this what are your thoughts what meaning does all this have for you
7740240 so its one of those things you just suck it up go about your business and try to have some fun with it
7740241 mike is a very mature guy so if he has to line up there he will
7740242 you cant replace coop because hes not just a playmaker
7740243 he made sure everybody came along with him thats tough to find
7740244 i thought i was going to be able to bounce back
7740245 if this levy doesnt pass well be forced to remove all the plaster from the walls your children will freeze you dont want that do you weve already had to stop providing toilet paper and washroom soap
7740246 did you hear that the grounds keeper is paid 65 000 a year
7740247 ex police open up kid i know youve used unstamped lemons
7740248 you never knew what person or booby trap was behind any door you were about to open
7740249 you cant say this route is becoming more dangerous due to global warming it was perfect conditions to climb mont blanc but a falling serac is like an earthquake we know they could happen at any time
7740250 they are part of the objective risks of the mountain in an area which is well known and which sometimes results in serac falls
7740251 avalanches are possible in the swiss alps in summer if it snows for a few days above 3 000 metres
7740252 the mont blancs very popular and busy but compared with the number of people who try there are only a few accidents on this mountain in summer some days we have over 100 000 visitors a day in chamonix 100 deaths a year in the alps is not a lot when you compare with car accidents
7740253 when we have good weather more people go out to the mountains
7740254 high mountain conditions have often been more difficult than in previous years as the weather has not been stable the good weather hardly lasted longer than three days and it snowed at high altitude at 4 000m
7740255 uh not sure if im a perm kind of guy
7740256 well bury our dead a half mile away from our homes to ensure that their rest is eternally peaceful
7740257 keep moving get back to where there are people around
7740258 well gosh im thinking we need to start worrying about the number of saber toothed bison weve been able to kill this year winter is coming and while were fine some of the other lodging areas are short of meat and furs its that esther
7740259 its all her fault the silly glutton she wandered off while the men were hunting all the women are supposed to stay in the lodging area but esther wandered now the mountain god is angry and has reduced the number of bison for the hunt
7740260 of course not dont tell me youve swallowed that simplistic hogwash of course if we could find a way to be less dependent on the bison count wed be ok but hey a guy has got to eat a man has to keep warm when the mrs thong is in a twist about something eh
7740261 are you dense well have to stone that stupid furry esther appease the mountain god actually we had to promise to kill her in the bambuto protocol treaty we signed with that other lodging area over there on the hilltop see it the one with the smoke they were pissed that we have more food than they do so we had to agree to snuff wandering esther whatever gets the bison back out here yknow there must be something to this angry mountain god thing all the guys over in la5 say its the prevailing consensus
7740262 the brainy sorts i think thats where esther was headed personally
7740263 the crops sir aye the crops theyve not been the same since we found a witch among us
7740264 keep your voice lowered if you would sir she might be in the mists around us
7740265 the witch would be esther she was seen walking on the undercliff by the sea and the crops starting withering in the sun soon after no rain for weeks on end she has angered the lord his wrath is mighty
7740266 oh you should have been at the meeting of the three villages they were all sure it was our esther after they found out about her comings and goings its a shame well have to burn her but we cant have the crops failing on account of our squeamishness over a little crispy remains well we do like her mind you shes awfully handy at the bread oven and never fails to help with the threshing but it cant be helped alas an agreement is an agreement
7740267 i can see plainly that the hex is upon you
7740268 well i understand were all worried about global warming the climate change all that i dont really get it all but it does sound serious
7740269 look no further than esther its the suv she drives and now the air is dank and chewy causing some kind of iceberg melting off in well north or south a pole
7740270 yup which they have a point of course were gluttonous and we dont want to make mother nature angry now do we
7740271 and its a flip of the coin if its going to come together
7740272 were talking to all of them to come up with the best spot
7740273 one of them said i was his favorite player i almost fell over
7740274 were just waiting for baseball to say turn it on
7740275 i think hes balanced his numbers in the minor leagues were good i cant say one side was stronger than the other there were no significant splits hitting from either side
7740276 its hard to say but i think hes a 25 to 30 home run guy
7740277 been better than the other two alex smith and shaun hill and there hasnt really been much of a gray area his plays been better at the position than what weve had at any point in the last three years
7740278 a million dollar friend to me is someone who takes the time to get to know you on more than a superficial level it is someone who is willing to put for the effort it takes to be a friend with no thought of what theyre going to get out of it
7740279 this is high ive been on this board for 25 years this is high and that brings this all into question
7740280 the alleged disabilities and or religious tenets outlined on said applications do not exist
7740281 we found that some of those applications are tainted and thats why they were not accepted by us
7740282 the people who signed it were unsure what they were signing
7740283 this is malicious these people are using the law to harm voters
7740284 in the neighborhood i live in there are a lot of jehovahs witnesses
7740285 it was hard for me to convince them but im a christian too and i have knowledge of the bible
7740286 incapacitated to such an extent that it would be an undue hardship to vote at the polls because of illness mental or physical disability blindness or a serious impairment of mobility
7740287 he is on disability hes got liver problems hes sick hes very very sick
7740288 hes in and out he has problems he comes here he fights with his girlfriend sometimes then he comes here
7740289 it became obvious to me 18 months to two years ago that with the retreat of the multiyear polar sea ice the coast guard was going to have to do more than it had in the past to provide maritime safety and security to northern and western alaska the arctic ocean and the beaufort sea
7740290 through the spring and summer weve been conducting a test bed for moving various coast guard units into the arctic environment and determining their suitability for service in northern alaska
7740291 the biggest hazard frankly is ensuring that we avoid sea ice
7740292 and the second issue is that helicopter operations will be constrained because in the arctic we have a concern with the ability to self rescue
7740293 so when you start launching helicopters and sending boats over the horizon you now have to worry about how do you get them back
7740294 for example if i have a ship of a certain size with a certain crew and a certain cargo inbound to new york at ambrose we understand what that means because we know the infrastructure
7740295 we know the traffic patterns we know past history with the company we know all the surrounding information for a vessel contact in much of the world
7740296 in order to project a surface presence in that part of the world for any extended period of time we very quickly realize that because of the weather conditions meaning that even though its more ice free than ever theres still ice much of the year and the distances involved these places are very far away
7740297 the issue of the full function operations the requirement to do everything we do in southern alaska in northern alaska at least seasonally will take several years perhaps up to five years to ramp up to a capability
7740298 and thats why were pushing forward to be positioned and to be prepared to ensure that we dont have a titanic of the north like the motor vessel explorer in antarctica last november
7740299 they would then get diversion a scheme for first offenders and the lesson would be learnt for the rest of their lives
7740300 the police said it was far too serious for diversion its gone far beyond what was intended
7740301 i am persuaded that young men setting out on their lives dont need convictions for such serious charges
7740302 its good motivation for us but that motivation is already there
7740303 we are pleased with the effort but not pleased with the outcome
7740304 there are a lot of reasons why our crowds have been small but mostly its been because we are not as competitive on the field as we need to be
7740305 didnt build that stadium for a below average football team
7740306 any way that we can get people to sample stanford football is something we need to explore
7740307 stanford was an entertaining product last year and that vibrancy and charisma winning when they are not supposed to sometimes losing when they are not supposed its entertainment the more people we expose we think theyll be happy with their investment
7740308 when the game starts im far more interested in the team and the players than how many people bothered to come it doesnt bother me until after the game is over
7740309 the thing is not only do we lose but sometimes we stink
7740310 kamu belajar rajin2 cari dadah yang boleh kuruskan badan abang ni cepat2 tak pun kamu belajar camane nak buat liposuction senang nak sedut lemak ni
7740311 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7740312 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7740313 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set
7740314 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7740315 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7740316 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7740317 oh man we have just had heaps of response its been much easier than i thought
7740318 people seem to be quite keen to come here so i am quite surprised
7740319 i have got a few bookings so things are looking good a fews better than none i tell myself so fingers crossed
7740320 not that i am aware of i never was aware of it i hardly read the newspapers or watch tv
7740321 i have been told the knitting lady brothel opponent gillian allardice has backed off shes not going to be knitting outside any more
7740322 oh come on donny they were threatening castration over a split infinitive are we gonna split hairs here am i wrong
7740323 while we still do not have a positive confirmation of where that c 130 is right now as of 11 15 this morning the tactical operations group 11 commander col isagani silva has just given me his report on some pieces of debris at the vicinity of davao gulf in between samal island and davao city
7740324 but we are still trying to confirm whether these pieces of debris were from the c 130 aircraft and the combat boots and some manuals they have recovered were from the pilots and crew of c 130 aircraft
7740325 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
7740326 unfortunately their aircraft was not able to land so we initiated search operations as early as that around 10 last night their aircraft is still missing up to now and were conducting search and rescue operations concentrating on the 20 mile radius around davao city international airport
7740327 were still verifying really as to what really transpired because this is something very unusual the aircraft and the pilots were all ok before take off and everything was normal until that time
7740328 most probably crashed thats why we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius
7740329 i think this happens to even the best hitters you have to keep working to get better
7740330 its just that i dont feel comfortable because when i do ill hit whatever they throw i know all be fine and theyve been throwing me good pitches to hit i just miss them its me nothing else
7740331 here take this vibartor and stand with the guys over there
7740332 go stand with the other cattle till we whistle for you shep
7740333 that wasnt my choice but you still take all the flak from it
7740334 after awhile youve gotta do what you gotta do and do the best at where youre at
7740335 in such stories they never say a name just sources
7740336 do they seem like they dont like me if i was an outcast and a bad guy why would i still be around
7740337 did you hear anything after that where was the big ripple from lotts comments he said his sources said ive never seen the man in the locker room
7740338 so ive had success with every running back that ive had gores big year was more of a high point because were good friends hes like a little brother to me
7740339 im going to still roll as long as im on the field
7740340 methane needs to be regularly monitored were not allowed to just let it escape into the atmosphere so we would eventually have to deal with methane in some form or another at our own expense where this allows us to joint venture with mdu and get rid of it ahead of time plus bring revenue that the city can use
7740341 if id known that was going to happen i wouldnt have gone to the ballpark
7740342 theres nothing like knowing the game is in your control
7740343 nothing that happened to me was because of that man baker
7740344 you have guys who go through their whole careers and dont get injured other guys pitch two years and get injured six times i dont think it has anything to do with a manager or a pitching coach or anything like that its either going to happen or its not
7740345 the concept of leasing the turnpike is a decided underdog
7740346 seems like they are always having to do work on it always having to fill potholes
7740347 when it comes to winter maintenance turnpike crews do whatever it takes to keep the road open in the heaviest snow and ice storms
7740348 it is the last bastion of political patronage for both parties
7740349 very few in politics want to mess up that arrangement
7740350 the governor said why dont we consider something like this
7740351 the concept of leasing the turnpike is a decided underdog
7740352 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7740353 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7740354 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7740355 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7740356 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7740357 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7740358 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7740359 the concept of leasing the turnpike is a decided underdog
7740360 seems like they are always having to do work on it always having to fill potholes
7740361 when it comes to winter maintenance turnpike crews do whatever it takes to keep the road open in the heaviest snow and ice storms
7740362 it is the last bastion of political patronage for both parties
7740363 very few in politics want to mess up that arrangement
7740364 the governor said why dont we consider something like this
7740365 the community needs to be the eyes and ears the community needs to observe the community needs to look at suspicious activity the community needs to write down license plates they need to be an integral part of this effort we need them very very desperately we cannot do this alone
7740366 their safety is paramount that its vital its important its job one the residents of oakland deserve better than to be victimized by acts of violence and robbery that tear at the very fabric of our community
7740367 people should be able to move throughout the day going about their lives with a sense of peace and security
7740368 so we cannot and will not allow fear to overtake our community
7740369 is she making this stuff up or does it really exist
7740370 we want to become a firm top three player by 2010 and become number one eventually
7740371 you see the depths of my heart and you love me the same
7740372 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7740373 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7740374 whatever the coach thinks is best we trust coach miles completely in our preparation
7740375 however hes going to handle it im sure will be best for the team
7740376 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7740377 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7740378 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward but we have plenty of time to sort through it they need some time off they really do
7740379 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7740380 but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7740381 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7740382 very difficult to refocus all my thinking is there in beijing
7740383 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7740384 be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year
7740385 instead of giving people speeding tickets were giving people tickets to the sylvania 300 and thats a pretty cool deal
7740386 i really thought our chase hopes were over at that point but we were able to rally and dig in and get a good finish
7740387 weve been struggling at the big tracks like california theres no surprise there
7740388 i think we saw some promise at michigan and hopefully that will carry over this weekend
7740389 i think that probably got blown out of proportion a little bit
7740390 my nature is that if anything is not exactly perfect im going to find fault with it and the expectation level is going to be set at a high standard
7740391 im always going to find the things that we didnt do up to the standard that i set all in all it wasnt a total wreck
7740392 theres going to be some things thursday night that dont happen exactly the way i want them to im sure in certain things
7740393 i think hes earned a couple of series in the game and well figure out when were going to put him in and play
7740394 i think hes good enough to help us win the game so were going to put him in there and see what he does under fire
7740395 never stopped fighting for folks who work long hours and face long odds and need someone on their side again
7740396 to end the war in iraq responsibly to build an economy that lifts every family to make health care available for every american and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college
7740397 all authority in heaven and earth is given to me
7740398 you dont have the things of god but the things of men
7740399 does the pastor strike you as a little cold does it bother you that he votes on his own salary did you hear about the squabble last year let me fill you in on what really happened
7740400 john you need to deal with your bitterness i wont listen to any more until you do that
7740401 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
7740402 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
7740403 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
7740404 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
7740405 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god

7740412 i have to give my partyroom the opportunity to meet and discuss the issue
7740413 but based on my knowledge of my 18 members previous positions in relation to this i doubt very much whether our partyroom will endorse it
7740414 i have a recommendation that will go to party rooms tomorrow and on thursday we will come out of that party meeting with a clear idea of what were going to do thats an issue for my colleagues
7740415 this is a wide ranging program across many of our businesses it affects corporate and group services affects a wide range of our businesses in the publishing and printing area
7740416 it affects fairfax new zealand the program will deliver around 50 million in annualised cost savings around 25 million of which of the savings will flow in the 2009 financial year
7740417 its journalism in the sense that subediting the paper is an important component but we do believe for a range of structural and other reasons that we can be more productive and itll have absolutely no impact on the quality of the papers
7740418 no were not its not within our control but we have a very constructive and open relationship with the staff and weve communicated directly with them
7740419 these sort of cuts by corporate management at one of australias largest companies is going to have a very serious affect on the quality of the journalism thats produced by the companys papers and websites and magazines
7740420 i think the really important question here is the sort of damage this is going to do the company for a bit of short term benefit a bit of short term cost saving
7740421 you cant produce the sort of quality product that are so essential in this day and age by cutting costs
7740422 dont take my word for it whats rupert murdoch doing hes not engaging in these sort of short sighted cost cutting measures hes investing in journalism and its only by investing in journalism that companies can position themselves for the long term
7740423 i will be telling my delegates that i will vote for barack obama
7740424 right now hillary is actually not deciding my vote the people who elected me to represent them are
7740425 any of hillarys delegates addressed at all by barack obama
7740426 its not hillarys job to deliver her voters to barack it is baracks job to recruit hillarys voters by appealing to the reasons we supported hillary in the first place
7740427 ive accepted the fact that im going to vote for the second best democrat in november
7740428 but im going to vote for the best democrat on wednesday
7740429 harder for me to let go of hillary than i thought
7740430 if there is some hanky panky way to do that i would go for it
7740431 we need to make a change at the white house
7740432 i am frankly distressed i think there are people in this delegation and certainly nationally that i dont think are committed to voting for the democratic party
7740433 it troubles me that people would rather have four more years of george bush because hillary didnt prevail
7740434 nobody has explained why it is disunity for us to do our job voting for senator clinton when were clinton delegates
7740435 it would cause disunity to tell us not to vote for her
7740436 what is absolutely critical to them is that we really honor hillary and that were cognizant of our actions
7740437 we can lay the love on hillary as deep and wide as humanly possible but we want to get the votes in and then move on
7740438 the problem is playing toronto cincinnati and beijing then coming back here in two weeks two times 12 hours jet lag
7740439 im a little bit more tired than i usually am but at the same time i must be very happy how i did this year
7740440 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7740441 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because my mind is still there

7740444 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer
7740445 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands he was determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7740446 after all thats happened these past 19 months see the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7740447 to commit to memory every single episode of the brady bunch
7740448 im really excited about all of us emulating her not only in her style but in her grace
7740449 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong
7740450 bostich fussible hit a sweet spot thats less world music than blissfully whirled music
7740451 i have often wished i had two penises to enjoy simultaneously the double but different sensations of oral and genital copulation
7740452 is the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer
7740453 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7740454 they think that if they can beat us here in minnesota they can beat us anywhere
7740455 but you know what theyre not going to beat us here
7740456 no democrat is taking this state for granted including me
7740457 we have demonstrated for a few decades that it is the swing voters in our state who are the balance of power
7740458 it gives us a great forum to talk to a part of the country that we need to talk to
7740459 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7740460 you see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7740461 we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7740462 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7740463 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7740464 there is a new wave of change all around us
7740465 and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation and this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7740466 so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause
7740467 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7740468 i am concerned about the length of time it took to notify the public about this escape
7740469 these people are considered dangerous and could possibly be armed so we are asking the public please do not approach them
7740470 they were in custody for a range of offences ranging from property offences to serious violent offences
7740471 were doing an internal review to get those details and know what happened we take these all seriously and work with the rcmp
7740472 this escape was from the middle portion built in the 1960s not the 1913 portion
7740473 im unable to comment at this time if infrastructure had anything to do with the escape
7740474 we wanted to make sure we had our information correct and that we then got it out as quickly as possible to the public
7740475 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america
7740476 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama to the presidency of the united states
7740477 together we have known success and seen setbacks but we have never lost our belief that we are all called to a better country and a newer world
7740478 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
7740479 nothing nothing is gonna keep me away form this special gathering tonight
7740480 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and bold endeavors
7740481 our people answered his call and rose to the challenge and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7740482 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7740483 but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7740484 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

7740500 prince john adopts a similar pose ken related the story of accompanying ollie to the white house in 2005 where he was the first animator to receive the national medal of arts the most touching aspect of the experience according to ken was not the medal rather the moment in which his father told glen keane recalls what it was like to work under this animation master the discussion of ollie as master animator was overseen by those artists who came to the studio in the 1970s such as brad bird together these men defined not only ollies philosophical understanding of craft but also the airy and subtle grace of his rough drawings lastly leonard maltin introduced a half dozen men who shared ollies lifelong enthusiasm for steam trains michael broggie whose father worked for walt disney grew up at the studio he explained how ollies backyard locomotive helped inspire walt to build a similar scale railroad in his own backyard without ollie michael suggested there might never have been a railroad in walts backyard and without that railroad there might not have been disneyland in an early version of this article i transcribed highlights from the evenings presentations onto the page but i soon discovered that the article wasnt the best way to convey the warmth humor and pathos of the evening so i clicked open dolby studio and started to piece highlights together into a podcast the result is a 25 minute highlight reel but you should know this the source audio comes from a reference file i didnt initially plan to use the audio for a podcast it was simply a reference file so i wouldnt misquote any of the presenters ive done my best to enhance smooth and clarify the audio but still its a little rough youll enjoy it more if you listen to it with headphones or earbuds rather than on speakers for me the ollie johnston tribute held a double sadness ollie johnston was the last of the walts nine old men those animators he most trusted at the studio the other eight have already passed on in fact most all of the disney animators from the 1930s have left us bill justice who joined disney in 1937 might be the only one left but the loss of ollie was greater than that of a single man it was the loss of a craft though the work and teachings of ollie johnston will continue to inspire young animators well into the future the world of animation has changed since ollie retired from the studio ollies brand of character based animation was a highly personal art even casual observers of animation can recognize the difference in a scene drawn by ollie johnston and a scene in the same movie drawn by another animator such as ken anderson because a single animator oversaw an entire scene or often a sequence of scenes the artists idiosyncratic drawing style graced each pose each movement fantasia

7740505 the surprising part is how he finished last year and the way he started this year

7740509 i got a great shot onto the green on my last one no 1 and tapped it in from 4 inches away for a birdie
7740510 hes been playing smart golf hes not trying to get all the strokes back on one shot
7740511 i only hit three fairways out of 14 but i hit 12 greens and putted well
7740512 if we get three kids in the mid to lower 70s we have a chance of winning each time
7740513 you cant count out cheyenne mountain either with the kids they have
7740514 i think she sent the message not only to gambari but also to the un and the burmese people that there is no tangible consequence from the last meetings
7740515 she obviously wants to send the message to the junta and to the un that she is frustrated with the lack of progress
7740516 we deeply regret that daw aung san suu kyi declined to meet with your excellency
7740517 her suu kyi tactic was clearly the result of frustration at the failure of the regime to take her and gambari seriously
7740518 he is doing what the junta asked for he is like a representative of the junta
7740519 mr gambari hasnt achieved any concrete result from this trip at all
7740520 there is no improvement in the political situation there was no discussion of the release of political prisoners

7740524 i always have been able to find them here any time between may and the end of august
7740525 um its in the thread that one of adzs account started he linked it from his site i know what you mean you want to go here to this link
7740526 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7740527 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7740528 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7740529 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7740530 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7740531 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7740532 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7740533 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7740534 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can

7740537 advanced analysis of the message structure to determine the probability
7740538 it was pretty much just a little payback for hitting his quarterback i understood
7740539 thats like cardinal rule no 1 with the linemen dont touch the quarterback theyre protecting him
7740540 he can score a touchdown on any play he has the ball in his hands hes rodney thats all i can say
7740541 he had a great cast around him similar to what i have the only difference between us is the wins and losses i feel like i have some of the same qualities its just going to come down to whether or not i execute put our team in position to win
7740542 ive never thought those won loss records for quarterback are like baseball pitchers there are too many other variables in it
7740543 rodney last year played tremendous at delaware and at appalachian he couldnt help it if one of the backs fumbled the ball and you count that as a loss
7740544 that was just a decision between me and coach matthews
7740545 we just tried to eliminate some of the outside influences so we could concentrate on football get back to the basics i wasnt trying to shy away from the media or anything like that it was just a decision we made to try to stay focused and get our team back on track
7740546 we were prepared saturday morning to tell the kids that drew was going to be the quarterback
7740547 i thought the first quarter last year at north carolina was the worst quarter wed played here in four or five years
7740548 it really had nothing to do with what north carolina did they made some plays but it was how poor our execution was on both sides of the ball i was embarrassed for everybody wearing purple as bad as we played in the first quarter we just laid an egg
7740549 who you open with in your first game really kind of dictates what youre going to do with your fall camp
7740550 you really have to have the equivalent of a couple of preseason games to get prepared to feel like youre in a position to win the game in preparing for duke weve had a very physical camp
7740551 i just felt like we needed to scrimmage more this camp and take some chances
7740552 where we are now i feel like were a better football team than we were three weeks ago
7740553 were really going down there kind of handcuffed and blindfolded
7740554 certainly i think theyre going to run a david cutcliffe offense what he ran at ole miss and tennessee
7740555 we looked at some ole miss tape and some tennessee tape thats all you can do
7740556 im sure well make some adjustments in the first quarter down there
7740557 they had peyton manning and jamal lewis and joey kent playing wide out they were pretty good it was some tough sledding for the bulldogs when we went against those guys
7740558 we heard a pop almost like a firecracker went off and then he started screaming and blood was coming down
7740559 it was so scary it just happened in split second
7740560 my sister said a gelatinous material came out of his eye which we believe now is the lens of his eye
7740561 when you take a bottle and put it on ice its not supposed to explode
7740562 my son is blind in one eye and they should be accountable
7740563 sorry for all the mondays and to those who cant sing

7740568 i can only think that people are looking at the continuing strength of the beer business higher margins
7740569 theres a chance people potentially were expecting a worse result
7740570 we are making good progress with our wine review but wont be commenting on our analysis or conclusions until the review is completed
7740571 ok i get it now im doing my best to end oppression and make the world peaceful
7740572 there was a connection between the shooter and the victim
7740573 they knew each other it wasnt a random shooting or a drive by shooting
7740574 i havent gotten a call from them yet but he does have my support
7740575 as you might imagine for barack running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother craig
7740576 i do not see any improvement in these issues for at least a year
7740577 the relationship would have to come out of the official box and become more people centric by enlarging stakeholders be it youth women businessmen academicians and widen the area of knowledge by bridging the information deficit that exists
7740578 through the personal engagement of leaderships as evidenced through the regular bilateral exchanges and interactions
7740579 the primary objective of such visits has been to transform these traditional and friendly ties into a new relationship
7740580 im sorry i already have animals and i need to consider their safety and health first
7740581 first the word of god torches the human centered view of the world and the fixation on individual happiness and fulfillment so common in the west
7740582 there is something in each of us that wants us to be unhappy
7740583 without difficulties life would be like a stream without rocks and curves about as interesting as concrete without problems there can be no personal growth no group achievement no progress i hate that word by the way for humanity but what matters about problems is what one does with them
7740584 so it is that the knowledge of the small minded cannot reach to that which is great just as the experience of a few years cannot equal that of many the mushroom of a morning knows not what takes place at the end of the month the short lived cicada has no awareness of what happens in the seasons beyond
7740585 the west is full of tiggers restless seekers of instant gratification larger than life overachievers the west idolizes them because theyre bouncy and exciting maybe even a bit too exciting and theyre becoming more exciting all the time it seems that its no longer adequate to be a true individual or even a hero now one needs to be some sort of superman living an overinflated life punctuated in true tigger fashion with exclamation marks faster than a speeding bullet more powerful than a locomotive able to leap tall buildings in a single bound this is the age of supereverything superstar superathlete supercoach superpolitician even superbusinessman faster than a speeding ticket more powerful than a profit motive able to lease tall buildings in a single day
7740586 tiggers are never satisfied because they dont know the feeling of accomplishment that eventually comes when one persistently applies ones will to the attaining of no immediately reachable goals
7740587 the worthwhile and important things in life wisdom and happiness in particular are simply not the sorts of things one can chase after and grab they are instead the sorts of things that come to us where we are if we let them if we stop trying too hard and just let things happen as they need to
7740588 the natural world needs to be protected from us its wisdom needs to be recognized respected and understood by us and not merely viewed through the distorted lenses of our illusions about it
7740589 in other words modern mans difficulties dangerous beliefs and feelings of loneliness spiritual emptiness and personal weakness are caused by his illusions about and separation from the natural world
7740590 dont make a big deal of anything just accept things as they come to you

7740611 he used to be really sweet sensitive and loving he started doing dope then his drinking got out of control and then the cheating started

7740615 i chose not to get married and have those sort of things music is my children
7740616 with an amazing ceremony the olympic games finished and for the first time china is in the first place of the medal table
7740617 weere perfect and glared the world for 16 days the games of beijing will be remembered as the most praised ones of all the history
7740618 id dare to say that we begging to count as consecutive the success at the medal table as it was done before by u s the red machine is going and with free road the asian giant finished waking up
7740619 were simply wonderful the facilities were unsurpassable the organization a model of efficiency with a great transportation with adequate information and high level computing systems nothing escaped from the organization committee
7740620 a huge challenge for london which has four years to work or simply admit that it is not possible to surpass the chinese economic and social device
7740621 beijing 2008 left a great challenge which it is not impossible to surpass if the respect peace and over all the olympic spirit are taken as the base
7740622 we have imagined great the olympic games of beijing 2008
7740623 the reality like in the best movies or novels always surpasses the imagination and beijing with it facilities its olympic village its order its logistic surpassed everything but even more at the trails the swimming pools and the fields
7740624 it was a presentation to the world of a great china and an asian continent in all the senses
7740625 the host won the biggest number of gold medals 51 and it displaced u s 36
7740626 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7740627 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7740628 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7740629 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7740630 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7740631 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7740632 hey i have an idea lets put a trailer for a romantic comedy based on a self help book about relationships before an action comedy tv show movie you know a little something for the ladies

7740643 weve basically been going through this standoff between buyers and sellers
7740644 were just seeing more and more increases in inventory and sales coming down
7740645 i cant buy another house until i sell my house up there
7740646 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7740647 these are things that we can do right now for the customer
7740648 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now
7740649 hondas been a fuel economy leader for an entire generation because we bake in good fuel economy at the design stage
7740650 we just really paid attention to detail in fuel economy
7740651 but surely there is nothing more important than bringing sk2 to the masses
7740652 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
7740653 therefore son of man prophesy and say to gog this is what the sovereign lord says in that day when my people israel are living in safety will you not take notice of it

7740655 yeah but that doesnt limit him in the tools he would use now does it

7740678 a friend its none of your fuckin business i didnt believe it then a couple of weeks ago when i left the studio i came here hoping to be with you i pulled up and the thoughts about what i had been told started runnin through my head i got pissed so i left and went down to see johnny down at the tattoo shop so i could clear my head a little alyson winters was there and i went home with her trying to forget about you it was meant to be a one night thing nothing else
7740679 where id rather fuck her id much rather have an eager whore than a frigid used up bitch like you
7740680 i swear to god i fuckin hate you you want to know something i could kill you right now and id get off on it since youve never been able to do it for me with that two inch long shriveled little stump you call a dick
7740681 hell my fuckin fingers are a hell of a lot better than you could ever be hell alyson can have you i think its funny that it takes so little to get that slut off
7740682 if thats what you think then its over and the next time you think you have the balls to ever raise a hand to me i swear to you that you will be on the ground and you will not get back up do you understand me woman

7740685 i swear i didnt mean to get you guys involved in this
7740686 when it involves you getting hurt it involves mandy you two are like sisters so that makes it her place to jump in and when it involves my brother beating you like a dead fuckin dog that most definitely makes it my place to try to keep it from happening again do what mandy says and ill make sure he comes nowhere near you do you understand me rachael
7740687 yes i understand but im so scared what has happened to him david youre his brother his twin brother surely you know something
7740688 success has gone to his fuckin head thats whats happened
7740689 he thinks that because he and the band have a record deal that he can do whatever he wants to whoever he wants and doesnt have to answer for any of it
7740690 by god the next time i see him he is damn sure going to answer for this
7740691 he thinks hes such a big fuckin rock star now i hate to admit hes my own fuckin flesh and blood
7740692 surely hes not like this when hes in certain company they must see it too since hes almost always with them it wouldnt make any sense otherwise
7740693 to kickin his sorry ass out of the band danny told me that theyve kept their mouths shut so far and they all know about him screwin that alyson girl again they havent brought it up yet i think theyll step up and do something once they see what he did to rachael they love her to death
7740694 hes changed so suddenly they dont know what to do or what to say around him anymore i think theyre just as scared to say something to him as everyone else he hasnt been right since james got killed now he just doesnt give a fuck anymore
7740695 rachael i cant help but feel responsible for this the same with david we shouldve seen this coming but didnt
7740696 i know he still loves you and i know you feel the same way but please rachael stay away from him for a while if youre out somewhere and see him walk the other way if he tries to call and talk to you hang up dont set yourself up for getting hurt again philip has turned into a sorry son of a bitch as of late so as your best friend listen to me and stay the fuck away from him
7740697 rachael i know youre awake i need to talk to you could you get up please
7740698 you can loosen up angel im not going to hurt you
7740699 if you came here to brag to me about how you ran over to alyson after you left i swear
7740700 no i didnt come here to do anything like that
7740701 that whole thing is over with rachael i ended it after i left earlier today
7740702 i thought you preferred her to me im frigid and used up remember

7740704 and davids no good for protection when hes snoring right
7740705 well you better not stay long if he catches you in here hes going to hurt you he and mandy are dead set on making you pay for what you did to me today and right now i hope they succeed
7740706 you have a lot of fuckin nerve coming in here at almost four oclock in the morning wanting to talk to me you said it was over so just leave it at that
7740707 rachael please dont make me ask again come back here
7740708 i came here to tell you that im sorry for what i did to you i love you rachael i never stopped loving you no matter how pissed off i get or what i say my feelings for you have never changed and never will
7740709 look at me philip look at my fuckin face this is your way of saying you love me if it is i would fuckin hate to see what youd do to me if you hated me
7740710 you beat me like a fuckin animal it took almost an hour to stop my nosebleed and im going to be fuckin lucky if my lip doesnt need stitches or that i can see out of my right eye again i have never seen you so angry philip i was almost sure that you were either going to choke me out or beat me to death
7740711 rachael ive told you a thousand fuckin times over seven fuckin years what happens when someone hits me i black out and i dont know what the damage is until after the fact if i knew that i was going to hurt you that bad i wouldve just walked out believe me baby please

7740713 i cant forgive you right now its going to be hard to trust you or feel comfortable around you for a long time and im sure you understand that i think its best that we just call it quits and try to be friends although being friends with you right now doesnt seem like a very good idea either im sorry philip but nothing you say or do is going to make me feel safe around you again
7740714 i was never around when you needed me like i told you alyson was used to take my mind off the situation she was a balm to numb the anger and the pain i didnt want to admit it was all my fault
7740715 i could sit here all night and listen to you swear up and down that youll quit drinking that youll do this and youll do that but i know you and you wont do a damn thing to change who you are and quite frankly i dont really believe that you ended it with whatever you said that fuckin whores name is you betrayed my trust and my love for the last time philip and im not taking it anymore
7740716 ill do anything i cant lose you rachael please dont do this
7740717 you better leave now if mandy hears you shes going call the police i havent decided yet if im going to press charges but unless you leave now im afraid i wont have any choice ill die before i allow myself to take you back after doing this to me

7740763 they were hitting him with the taser and he wasnt fighting he was just trying to get back up he didnt understand the situation were they in the wrong i dont know

7740799 if you find for the plaintiff but you find that the plaintiff has failed to prove damages as defined in these instructions you must award nominal damages
7740800 an actual award of compensatory damages is not necessary rather the plaintiff need only prove that he or she suffered damages or injury
7740801 the commissioner has not persuaded us that the reasoning of gagnon should extend to this case where compensatory damages even nominal damages were legally available and explicitly sought by the commissioner
7740802 we reverse the post verdict order and remand for a new damages phase trial limited to proffer of the nolhga premise and a determination of damages including punitive damages if any on that theory

7740810 the elected representatives in iran to meet with members of the united states congress
7740811 we had one overt policy which was one of negotiation and confidence building and a covert policy which was continuation of activities
7740812 during our negotiations and so long as we were not subjected to sanctions we could import technology we should have negotiated for so long and benefited from the atmosphere of negotiations to the extent we could import all the technology needed
7740813 iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups of iraqi shia militants
7740814 i voted against the amendment to designate irans revolutionary guard as a terrorist organization because i dont trust this administration
7740815 this senator biden correctly says israel could not suppress hizbullah in lebanon so how can the u s stand face to face with a nation of 70 million this is the blessing of the guardianship of the jurists the theocracy which plants such thoughts in the hearts of u s senators and forces them to make such confessions
7740816 advanced amateur photographers blur the line between the hobbyist and the professional looking for professional features and capabilities in their equipment that will allow them to capture that awe inspiring image canon is constantly striving to provide these shooters with the most advanced imaging technology like the new eos 50d digital slr camera to fuel their passion for photography and help them achieve their creative potential
7740817 the success of the masterpieces seems to lie not so much in their freedom from faults indeed we tolerate the grossest errors in them all but in the immense persuasiveness of a mind which has completely master its perspective
7740818 we believe the creative vision propelling each movie comes from one or two people and not from either corporate executives or a development department our philosophy is you get great creative people you bet big on them you give them enormous leeway and support and you provide them with an environment in which they can get honest feedback from everyone
7740819 we want to make sure our clients have a place where they can be as safe and dignified as possible
7740820 we knew some folks would ask why we couldnt make it a move permanent so we decided to stay our clients may be homeless but this is their neighborhood their community and their neck of the woods uprooting them would be no more fair than if you did that to any other neighborhood
7740821 how much bs are you going to put up with
7740822 if theyre fenced in and surrounded by protests noise and crowds
7740823 we have to go on standstill just because of those people
7740824 when they put those tarps up we knew what they thought about us its about making the city pretty thats what its all about
7740825 were not trying to hide them nor are we trying to put them on display we have a fundamental belief in the dignity of every human person and we are trying to get people to hear the voices of the poor
7740826 frankly they are hardly ever heard by anyone in our political system

7740835 performance from the fx35 was very good for a 10 megapixel camera
7740836 so how did the panasonic fx35 do on our image quality tests in the lab
7740837 the good compact wide angle lens camera with smart software the bad proprietary connector requires special cables no viewfinder
7740838 the fx35 takes good quality photos though there are definitely some issues to point out on the whole photos were well exposed with pleasing vivid color images are on the soft side
7740839 the good 25mm wide angle lens hd quality video recording elegant design maximum iso of 6 400 the bad slightly soft images focusing a tad slow
7740840 the canon sd1100 is is a full featured point and shoot digicam that really impresses if you crave compactness without sacrificing too much the canon sd1100 really delivers
7740841 we analyze the color of the video the sd1100 is captures under good lighting using two large lights in our test lab in this lighting the sd1100 is does a decent job capturing color there is some error but this is a lot less extreme than many cameras weve tested
7740842 the sd1100 iss auto exposure system is generally accurate and in good lighting the camera produces dependably very good to excellent images the sd1100 is is an impressive digicam when compared to the competition but it doesnt fare quite as well when compared to the original sd1000
7740843 the canon sd1100 is physically attractive but its images arent always as beautiful images look good when taken in bright light with the iso set low but images taken with high iso settings are noisy and can look somewhat unpleasant
7740844 canon leads the field in image quality because it relies on intelligent solutions not quick fixes
7740845 every camera released today incorporates class leading features to combat common problems like camera shake and subject blur without sacrificing overall image quality

7740877 sbp would broaden the horizon of islamic banking and agriculture while smes and micro finance would be given special attention in the new policy
7740878 in the islamic banking policy we would focus on evolving a regulatory framework enhancing the spectrum of islamic banking strengthening shariah compliances mechanism internal and external stakeholders would be consulted for better liaison and special focus would be made on strengthening human resources
7740879 in 2003 the market share of islamic banking in the country was only 0 5 percent with only one full fledge bank and one branch of a conventional bank but now the deposit of islamic banks is rs 160 billion which is 4 5 percent of the market share
7740880 indonesian islamic banks could grasp only 1 5 percent market share in more than 10 years while malaysian islamic banks could accumulate 12 percent in more than 20 years
7740881 we have started from zero and to reach 100 there is need of patience we should not go for a jump of 100 steps rather one step approach would make us successful

7740908 this is my life work helping people understand and respond to this message it came as a sheer gift to me a real surprise god handling all the details when it came to presenting the message to people who had no background in gods way i was the least qualified of any of the available christians god saw to it that i was equipped but you can be sure that it had nothing to do with my natural abilities and so here i am preaching and writing about things that are way over my head the inexhaustible riches and generosity of christ my task is to bring out in the open and make plain what god who created all this in the first place has been doing in secret and behind the scenes all along

7740913 we are of course extremely proud of him proud of his achievements but more proud of him as a person for the way he coped with those achievements
7740914 were very touched that people continue to remember him as they do so long after he retired from playing cricket
7740915 i suppose it the level of interest does astound us it always astounded him
7740916 he couldnt understand why people still remembered him so long after hed finished playing
7740917 i think we share that same outlook but its clear that people do and that clearly relates partly to his achievements but i think it also relates to something that is deeper and more significant than that
7740918 the fact we have this collection is in no small measure due to my mother
7740919 my father was a chucker outer and my mother in good measure nurtured this collection she was very keen on keeping family things together

7740921 i played with this stuff in the backyard which people now handle with white gloves so it is very precious to our family and im delighted we can continue to be associated with it

7740941 they can come out in several different options whether its two backs or no backs and five receivers
7740942 we have to be prepared to adjust to whatever they do we have to be aggressive at times but also be conservative at others obviously youd like to do both but we have to just react to how they come out
7740943 our team is excited to come out and play our first game but we have to have a good week of preparation and make sure we dont get ahead of ourselves

7741044 there would have been nothing better than putting a w on the board and waving goodbye to this place but it didnt work out that way
7741045 i had the opportunity to play with him in florida hes well prepared hes probably one of the most prepared guys that ive ever played with as far as scouting pitchers hes a hall of famer one day he just took a pitch and drove it out
7741046 thats probably as good a performance as ive seen this year pitched against us
7741047 he was down in the strike zone at 92 and 94 mph the ball was running sinking
7741048 we felt like we had a chance to win three of four and we ran into a good pitcher tonight
7741049 the guy threw predominantly all fastballs and you got one run so that tells you how much it was moving you tip your hat to him
7741050 oh well the postman said we had too much mail stacked up so he will deliver it a little each day

7741066 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7741067 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7741068 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable

7741082 over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7741083 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
7741084 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7741085 is always gravely evil and so are the evasions employed to justify it

7741087 listen i want you guys to look after the girls look after mommy before i get there and ill see you guys on thursday all right
7741088 she was unbelievable but im not surprised when she does something she does it well
7741089 she told her story its a story that a lot of families can relate to her dad struggled worked hard and here his daughter is addressing the nation
7741090 not the city which enthusiastically approved the creation of dozens of new neighborhoods without pausing to wonder if it could absorb the growth
7741091 obviously not the speculators turned landlords who thought that they could get san francisco rents in a working class agricultural city ranked by the american lung association as having some of the worst air in the nation
7741092 and sadly not the local folk who moved up and took on more debt than they could afford they believed because who was telling them differently that the good times would be endless
7741093 the belief that this dream could be achieved with no risk no worry and no money down was at the center of the american romance with real estate in the early years of this decade and not just in merced
7741094 how long will the economy have to pay the price for that illusion the experience of merced which rose higher and fell faster than nearly anywhere else suggests that recovery from the national real estate debacle will be painful and protracted

7741241 mistrust and resentments continued to boil among top associates of presumptive nominee barack obama and his defeated rival hillary rodham clinton
7741242 one flashpoint is the assigned speech topic for former president bill clinton who is scheduled to speak wednesday night when the convention theme is securing americas future
7741243 the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas emphasizing the contrast between the bush years and his own record in the 1990s

7741316 estoy aqu como una esposa que ama a su marido y cree que ser un presidente extraordinario

7741325 for the past seven seasons paula has had to endure the experience of being the only woman at the judges table
7741326 with kara by her side paula has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7741327 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7741328 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7741329 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7741330 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers

7741341 and my goals have shifted as ive become maybe more experienced as the head coach and thats with having as healthy a team as you can come out of fall camp with
7741342 it is funny that could be such a priority but when you consider there are 13 more weeks to play your best players are who youd like to do that with and how we manage a few of our injuries i think has really helped us as you watch austin collie run around for example maybe a few years ago as i was the head coach that wouldnt have happened probably to the detriment of our team
7741343 and now we do know whos capable and whos not which is one of the goals we established
7741344 defensively it was a matter of getting as much experience as many snaps as we could
7741345 we didnt devise scrimmages as much to make those plays live because i think that increases risk of injury so i kind off chose a trade off there less live work hopefully we will be ready the first game
7741346 but thats what the preseason is for to come and play these kind of teams we learned a lot about the team and we did some good things we just have to bounce back
7741347 why dont you just pick hillary that would be fantastic

7741359 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to

7741361 we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7741362 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7741363 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7741364 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7741365 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7741366 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7741367 what it is is to get in there and fix these issues in the past it just hasnt happened
7741368 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7741369 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report

7741375 as soon as we have received a call about a tree being down our crews have been dispatched to clear the roadway

7741417 ich habe lange berlegt ob ich mir das anschauen soll
7741418 ich sa mit meiner frau und meiner enkelin im auto und schaute zu wie die schaufel den ganzen teppich rausgerissen hat in dem moment lief vor meinem inneren auge ein film ab teppich kaufen verlegen und die ganzen geschichten wie wir in dem haus erlebt haben
7741419 wir haben hier eine gute nachbarschaft f hlen uns wohl der neue ort ist ruhiger es ist weniger verkehr die kinder haben eine sch ne moderne schule und einen zentral gelegenen sportplatz

7741425 es ist schade dass uns dieser positive effekt nicht mehr gegeben ist

7741431 she was unbelievable but im not surprised when she does something she does it well
7741432 she told her story its a story that a lot of families can relate to her dad struggled worked hard and here his daughter is addressing the nation
7741433 its an attractive portrait of the family i honestly did not think the speech was particularly effective
7741434 it was moving on some level as juan said it was a very liberal speech any sort of conservative sensibility that might have appealed to those voters who are little nervous about them i just really didnt see that there
7741435 thats a lot to ask for a short speech on the first night of the convention

7741441 tu hai preso la licenza liceale e sei cosi stupido da non pensare pi in l del tuo naso un uomo cui dio ha dato lintelligenza non dovrebbe forse guadare anche un po pi lontano
7741442 ma zio quello che viene dopo la morte nessuno lo sa
7741443 perch c qualcuno che so bene ci che viene dopo la morte ges e lui ha detto larga la via che porta alla perdizione stretta invece la via che conduce alla vita dopo la morte c il giudizio di dio e si pu essere condannati oppure salvati tu decidi
7741444 infame non trovo parola peggiore per descrivere la tua vilt osi presentarti a me a me essere odioso il pi odioso a me e agli dei e a tutto il genere umano

7741461 frank marshall davis alleged communist was early influence on barack obama
7741462 although identified only as frank in mr obamas memoir dreams from my father it has now been established that he was frank marshall davis a radical activist and journalist who had been suspected of being a member of the communist party in the 1950s
7741463 my reporting conclusion was the role of frank had been hyped out of all proportion both by obama himself in his book and some others later he did not play a role in really shaping obama
7741464 was chatting with him davis that late autumn afternoon as dunham and barry obama approached
7741465 its possible he briefly went back to indonesia before actually starting at the school
7741466 frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7741467 bridges of course always denied party membership and attempts were made to deport him because he was a communist he was born in australia but he was able to fight back because he had very very sharp shyster lawyers and a lot of friends in the u s government that helped him and they prevented his deportation but he had been a major force promoting communism
7741468 the book which closely tracks mr daviss life in chicago and hawaii and the fact that his first wife was black and his second white describes in lurid detail a series of shockingly sordid sexual encounters often involving group sex one chapter concerns the seduction by mr davis and his first wife of a 13 year old girl called anne mr davis wrote that it was the girl who had suggested he had sex with her
7741469 he then described how he and his wife would have sex with the girl
7741470 mr davis would cruise in hawaii parks looking for couples or female tourists to have sex with he derived sexual gratification from bondage simulated rape and being flogged and urinated on
7741471 left himself some wiggle room not least i suppose because of the possibility of prosecution
7741472 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7741473 listen i want you guys to look after the girls look after mommy before i get there and ill see you guys on thursday all right
7741474 she was unbelievable but im not surprised when she does something she does it well
7741475 she told her story its a story that a lot of families can relate to her dad struggled worked hard and here his daughter is addressing the nation
7741476 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7741477 its becoming increasingly expensive for both fannie and freddie to fund their business
7741478 if thats not addressed fairly soon the companies will continue to be under stress
7741479 im bullish now for the short medium and long term
7741480 im not always short term bullish but i think health care will be the best performing sector for the next 12 months
7741481 there is more of an emphasis on financial and energy regulation than health care reform
7741482 the population is getting older biotech life science and medical device companies are still at the forefront of innovation
7741483 biotech companies are a lot more mature these days they are holding onto more cash they are not turning public as early as they used to
7741484 working people in silicon valley are walking an economic tightrope and any unexpected medical bill or even a car breakdown can push them over the edge
7741485 this report does an excellent job documenting what people outside the region have been slow to understand that silicon valley is a fairly brutal environment
7741486 our performance on the global stage doesnt necessarily translate into regional prosperity the kind that is widely shared so you get this troubling picture where our companies are thriving but the region feels worse off
7741487 the bay area council has seen increasing evidence that an increasing wage disparity is putting the region at significant risk
7741488 the sustainability of the economy depends on people at all levels being able to live and work here

7741501 there is no stronger surrogate for senator obama than senator clinton

7741504 id still want to be behind her for the first couple times

7741516 put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7741517 we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong

7741525 we are internally unable to estimate the effect on sales going forward
7741526 our primary responsibility and need at this stage has been to remove the recalled products from the market weve provided the list of products and weve been in direct contact and have talked with every single one of the customers and distributors that have received and distributed that product
7741527 we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7741528 with six people that escaped i would have to surmise there was some planning involved in this and thats what i want to have the investigation look into did staff miss signals did they miss signs that there was something going on did the actual day to day operations contribute to this in some shape or form
7741529 we are all just human beings who want to feel good about what we do
7741530 nothing good in the world has been accomplished without passion
7741531 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
7741532 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
7741533 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7741534 feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7741535 just the vision that they have for our country that family is a priority and her daughters are her world
7741536 michelle obama showed tonight what democratic family values truly are
7741537 she described the similarities between her and baracks upbringing in a moving way demonstrating that with hard work anything is possible
7741538 who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7741539 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7741540 i think this is not the way to go and wrong
7741541 the world must increase pressure on iran over its nuclear program before israel feels it has its
7741542 put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7741543 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7741544 like you and i believe that america should be a place where you can make it if you try
7741545 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7741546 she is on her way to the little country of georgia
7741547 im gone all the time i cant be around as much as mom
7741548 i havent been in this country all my life kristina things are different here and i have to adapt
7741549 if peru is so wonderful then why the hell did you move here
7741550 can i have some sprite and cranberry juice with my vodka thanks
7741551 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7741552 the boys are going well they won i think their first game since 2000 in south africa and an opportunity to win for the first time in almost 50 years at altitude and the tri nations
7741553 were a good chance at winning it so its a tough team to crack at the moment
7741554 but i think ive showed im not too far away and im playing well so ill just wait for a phone call
7741555 i was pretty happy with the way australia a went even though we lost the last game to lose the tournament
7741556 ive been playing a lot of footy so its just a matter of keeping myself on the park in terms of keeping my body right
7741557 this season just gone i thought the rugby we played was really good we just found ways not to win games and i think thats the key
7741558 all those teams at the table didnt play great rugby every week they just found ways to win and hopefully a tour like this the culture it builds will impart in the team the ability to find the way to win games
7741559 and thats really all we need to do clean up a few areas of our game and just find ways to win
7741560 prices are not going up as a result of what were doing
7741561 prices will rise as a result of emissions trading they will rise as a result of actions of governments around the world to tackle climate change and gas emissions
7741562 the point is this if you increase the supply of electricity then you put a downward pressure on electricity prices
7741563 theres a national regulator these companies operate in a national market if theyre going to switch their power stations off then their competitors in victoria south australia and queensland and their other competitors in nsw will supply their electricity
7741564 the second point is the national regulator holds back around 850 megawatts of power
7741565 if theres a company or power station that wants to play games theres penalties but the reserve trading capacity of the national regulator can come in and have that electricity supplied
7741566 thirdly making a return on behalf of shareholders whats the best way to do that get more customers and thats exactly whats happening
7741567 and there is a simple reason i got elected to do what is right not necessarily what is popular

7741573 i dont think barry realises how close he is coming to seriously getting the business community offside
7741574 he is going to have some serious navel gazing to do if he plans to sell it off when he is premier but opposed it in 2008
7741575 seven has kept the accc regularly updated on its purchase of shares in wan and this review was foreshadowed by the accc some time ago seven said in a statement today

7741578 pebble beach and those kinds of trophy assets its clear those were crazy deals but now theyre buying things that are earnings enhancing and using cash thats been generating no income to do it said london based scott mcglashan who manages japanese stocks for j o hambro capital management
7741579 its a very opportune time for japanese companies looking to make acquisitions overseas
7741580 in general m amp a doesnt benefit the acquirer because it tends to occur during boom times when management is overconfident and they pay too much said seiichiro iwasawa chief strategist at tokyo based nomura securities
7741581 japan is unique because they remember their massive bubble era failures and have such low confidence that they are being extremely careful to do deals that make sense
7741582 the deals are nowhere near as accretive as returning cash to shareholders or buying domestic competitors and profiting through consolidation and cost saving he said

7741584 at present the white is ultra white its just magnificent

7741586 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7741587 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7741588 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7741589 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7741590 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7741591 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7741592 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are going to do
7741593 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president

7741613 i told them to get ready to have a real good practice tomorrow
7741614 we had a real good camp and was really proud of it outside of two or three really good injuries i thought the guys gave good effort and we got a lot of things done
7741615 you always hate to lose your starters but that is a part of football
7741616 we have been proud of the guys that have stepped up and thats what we have to tell them everyday that is why when you stand on the sideline there needs to be a mental rep going on in your head because you never know when your name is going to be called
7741617 memphis has a lot of success in the last several years and they have a lot of confidence they have some very good athletes at wide receiver quarterback is one position coming from a junior college that you dont know much about but apparently he is a very athletic player who likes to run the ball and throw all you have to do is look at the score of the last several years between ole miss and memphis and realize the rivalry and competitive spirit between one another
7741618 cordera eason is going to be in there first i think if you have done research on me we have done this quite a bit its not just for show you just dont ever know it is just hard to separate the running backs brandon bolden or enrique davis will be in next depending on the situation
7741619 we will just have to see how the flow of the game goes and they all know they have to be sitting on g o there are some sets that have three running backs that is why you have all these guys listed on the depth chart if they werent listed on the piece of paper then we werent thinking about them in terms of the game plan
7741620 jamarca sanford has been a great leader for us he has really stepped up ashlee palmer michael oher darryl harris and peria jerry have done a really good job of accepting what were trying to do its the next play if something doesnt go right then well get them next play it is also the theme of one heartbeat and finishing everything you do and these guys have carried it out

7741623 im upset because we just passed this levy this tax levy to give the hospital a lot of money and they made it seem like they were going to use the money for the best interest of the community but it just seems like now theyre cutting a huge part of what the community relies on the hospital for
7741624 weve elected these officials to talk on our behalf and work in our best interest and i feel like its their job to keep ob and to doing something for us in this situation
7741625 we have a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer we believe that they have a viable plan for turning the hospital finances around
7741626 i dont feel like i trust them now and i dont feel like they are working in our best interest

7741705 the thing is they got guys that are willing to make a three year commitment which i think is tremendous
7741706 we had guys that committed for 2004 and then all of a sudden 9 11 happened and then there were

7741708 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open

7741736 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report

7741758 the trinamool congress is pro industry and pro farmer but the communists are pro industry and they make no pretence of being pro farmer the basic issue is that the chief minister should have got the consensus of all shareholders and all people in singur when he brought the tatas here

7741779 anthony moved across to betfair on secondment from pbl in 2006 to guide the initial stages of betfairs establishment in the australian wagering landscape he will leave his position as ceo with the knowledge that betfair is well placed to achieve its objectives in the australian market while well be sad to see anthony go were delighted that he will retain a role in the business by staying on the companys board
7741780 andrew has been crucial to the companys continued growth in australia over the last four years and is the natural successor to anthony
7741781 he has worked alongside anthony for the last two years and was the obvious choice to guide betfair through the next stage of its development
7741782 thats where i started its definitely nice to get back there and play a few games for the most part everything seems to have come back fairly quickly
7741783 i understand that gordon is the third baseman now but given the opportunity im going to try to make the most of it enjoy it and kind of prove i can still play there
7741784 right now we are trying to make sure that mark after a long absence of not playing that position is as prepared as possible
7741785 its one of the reasons i didnt force the issue with the questions i was asked on why didnt i send gil back out over 100 pitches in his last outing against cleveland
7741786 you should always know as a manager and pitching coach what the next rotation will look like and will they get an extra day of rest its an opportunity for gil to get an extra day of rest
7741787 not a whole lot to say i left a lot of pitches hanging i didnt throw many good breaking balls my fastball wasnt good at least i hung in there until the seventh
7741788 so when you finally get to this point youre more aggravated when this happens than anything
7741789 the home run was probably one of the better pitches i threw all day
7741790 knee high on the corner away but on a day when my velocity wasnt up
7741791 normally i could get that pitch by him but he put good wood on it and wrapped it around the pole
7741792 id have to say its a coincidence because hes a very good pitcher
7741793 he showed that tonight when he got in trouble how he worked out of it
7741794 we got five runs off him and we couldve had 10 or 11 thats what good pitchers do they know how to stop the damage
7741795 but even though gil didnt have his overpowering stuff he kept us in the game and gave us a chance to win that ballgame we just couldnt get it rolling
7741796 anything that is complex is not useful and anything that is useful is simple this has been my whole lifes motto
7741797 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him

7741799 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
7741800 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7741801 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7741802 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7741803 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7741804 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7741805 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7741806 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7741807 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7741808 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7741809 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7741810 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7741811 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7741812 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7741813 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions

7741818 eighty five percent of the people are good some are actually bringing in food for us pizza doughnuts coffee but youre going to have a small percentage when youre dealing with the public thats going to be a little tough on you but that goes with the territory
7741819 were boiling some water at home for cooking and for washing i boil it and for doing dishes
7741820 weve been in this business for 102 years in wareham and this has happened in two of those 102 years
7741821 unfortunately its been back to back which has brought us to this position we dont really know the cause of the contamination but the system has grown by 30 percent since seven to 10 years ago were not a small system anymore
7741822 heres my short excerpt from my eppie nominated cozy vampire mystery underdead about middle school science teacher jo gartner who is bitten by an inept vampire and becomes almost undead
7741823 if it doesnt seem to be a problem with the five board members maybe well continue it
7741824 its been and continues to be a crazy couple months
7741825 we have been working very hard over the past few weeks to find ways to make the budget work while saving jobs and programing
7741826 in previous years the funds have been used for paraprofessionals but this year we will be using the money to help bring back a kindergarten teacher since the grant will not cover the whole amount about 10 000 will come from the operating budget to fund the balance of her salary
7741827 our art teacher is going out on extended maternity leave at the end of october instead of bringing in someone else to teach art the money will go toward keeping the library open
7741828 this doesnt mean that there will be no art forever at the school just the rest of this year
7741829 we have taken pretty substantial steps to cut down on utilities such as turning every other light off in the corridors and turning the heat down i hope it is going to be a mild winter because we dont want to have to lay off people to pay the heating bill
7741830 na pr xima vez que voc ouvir dizer que algu m est diante de um problema e acreditar que o problema n o lhe diz respeito lembre se que quando h uma ratoeira na casa toda fazenda corre risco o problema de um problema de todos
7741831 the law and order situation in nwfp and fata will not be solved until theres a stable government in islamabad
7741832 saving lives should be the first issue then we can look at the judges
7741833 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7741834 are we now a laughingstock for those who didnt want democracy in pakistan for them its a victory but were both losers
7741835 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7741836 seeing kids in iron lungs was a real impetus in working toward helping control the virus
7741837 mr sisson has exposed the town to unnecessary litigation and potential liability
7741838 during this period of time the board of selectmen has taken every necessary step to see that this matter did not progress to the level it has now
7741839 i cant be responsible or accountable for what he runs off the mouth about
7741840 theres just too much uncertainty out there creating all this volatility and whats adding to the volatility is were entering this holiday period the swings are exaggerated by the light volumes
7741841 the whole week is going to be a do nothing week
7741842 the market doesnt dance with the same partner forever its all a matter of investors starting to look beyond the valley of all the problems to better times ahead
7741843 will some bodies go unidentified i cannot tell you right now but it is a possibility
7741844 in general the company was fine and no problems whatsoever were detected
7741845 from the caribbean to the caspian weve had one bullish headline after another and the market cannot generate a sustained rally
7741846 it certainly doesnt bode well for anyone who owns commodities
7741847 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7741848 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries
7741849 its been fits and starts but theres always some activity going on
7741850 weve even seen several properties in the past month that have had multiple offers
7741851 a lot of sellers are nostalgic for what was so theyre disengaging from the market
7741852 maybe theyre going to florida for all the good buys down there
7741853 foreclosures are coming onto the market faster than you could keep up with them
7741854 its an excellent time to buy there are plenty of houses on the market plenty to choose from
7741855 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
7741856 this is a case where everyone was so enamored and felt so much sympathy for the holocaust survivor it just overwhelmed everyone in the case including the jury
7741857 now to find out that the book was not true that is fraud on the court
7741858 this credibility issue is something jane is digging up now
7741859 thats not what the trial was about it was about the fact that she cheated us
7741860 she said the reason she was so attached to dogs is because she had been so attached to wolves
7741861 this story is mine it is not actually reality but my reality my way of surviving
7741862 from the outset she breached her contract but nobody knew it until much later
7741863 i think she went along thinking she had a blockbuster and she didnt want to hear anything about it not possibly being true
7741864 she always maintained that this was truth as she recalled it and i trusted that that was the case
7741865 if you read a lot of holocaust literature all survivor stories are miraculous
7741866 show the desperate level al qaida has reached with members of one family driving each other to death
7741867 i swear to allah that i do not know them they were strangers
7741868 no no they put it on me and told me to take it off at home
7741869 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7741870 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7741871 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7741872 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armored vehicles
7741873 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
7741874 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7741875 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7741876 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7741877 im ready to go back and see all my friends but im excited about school this year because i have the best teacher miss matos
7741878 my cousin had her last year and he told me she was the best
7741879 it has all these colors inside like purple green and yellow i like school and spelling is my favorite part because i always get as
7741880 ive been waiting all summer for this and its my big day too
7741881 the building is sparkling and everything is looking great i had my first meeting with the staff today and they are full of energy tomorrow i get to watch it all unfold and get a feel for how the school is
7741882 my 7 year old is going into second grade and my 5 year old starts kindergarten wednesday i have a 3 year old who will be going to preschool next i am not planning any activities except rest for this weekend
7741883 i guess im here for the people and its my pleasure
7741884 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7741885 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7741886 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7741887 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7741888 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7741889 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7741890 i know you have students who come from all over the world i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7741891 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7741892 noaas decision on these measures is based on the best data and scientific understanding available
7741893 what we have seen over and over again where economics and partisanship and political interests bump up against the science science loses
7741894 where the science is the weakest and the economic impact is the greatest
7741895 its really a challenging time in young students lives because they are on their own for the first time
7741896 some kids who have been sheltered they find it difficult to just transition from having parents providing three meals a day to making their own selections
7741897 freshmen have a schedule packed with classes that makes it difficult to eat regular meals
7741898 i encourage them to look at their class schedule and find times to eat their meals its not a good idea to rush to class and not eat anything until 2 p m
7741899 i know a lot of college students really enjoy sleeping late and then rushing to classes but i think its really important to take time for that meal
7741900 i tell them they can enjoy their friends without eating again if theyve already had dinner
7741901 during finals we had an ice cream night and a doughnut night
7741902 and you can almost always find someone who wants to order pizza
7741903 i recommend that when they go to a dining hall they first start with a salad or soup
7741904 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7741905 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7741906 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here that they were elected to represent
7741907 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7741908 that however they decide to vote we will all be united behind senator obama
7741909 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
7741910 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7741911 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7741912 we are neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7741913 we hope that sharif will not cause us any pain nor that we will cause any pain to him
7741914 if the government is showing resolve they should be encouraged
7741915 if pakistan fails to overcome this problem the whole world will have failed
7741916 this is part of an ongoing ice investigation that has revealed that illegal aliens are employed at howard industries
7741917 evidence relating to aggravated identity theft fraudulent use of social security numbers and other crimes as well as a civil search warrant for individuals illegally in the united states
7741918 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs
7741919 it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
7741920 everybodys crying worried about whats going to happen to him
7741921 some people have the money and can buy the fish but id rather do it this way have fun take the day off and enjoy it
7741922 you can spend a lot of money buying food but this way we get our own food and we save some money
7741923 i do a little bit less shopping now of course if you catch enough fish it goes a long way
7741924 if you do it a lot it can be expensive but consider buying a couple of mackerel or a box of squid every couple of days compared with 5 a pound for chicken breast it makes a big difference
7741925 its free bait but youve got to use your energy a little bit
7741926 if we fished to catch food wed be pretty hungry
7741927 if you know what youre doing if you know when to go and how to do it then its fine we met a family that was out here all night long and they said they were catching fish left and right they knew what they were doing
7741928 its something good to do together soon hell be older and we wont be able to do things like this much anymore it beats sitting at home
7741929 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow

7741933 there are still a lot of families that have experienced a lot of damage some of which is not covered by insurance we have a state disaster relief fund that is in desperate need of donations from folks that are willing to give
7741934 we want to do everything we can to help the families and individuals who suffered as a result of the tornado
7741935 were very aware that communities have spent considerable dollars in the recovery phase after the tornado and the floods and were very aware that many of them have budgets that are strained which is why were going to expedite the reimbursement process
7741936 the people who get the top salaries wear multiple hats
7741937 if you are going to have people you have to pay them a living wage
7741938 that contract is very clear that this location will always be known as hoppys landing
7741939 basically what youre doing with this is cutting a portion off and naming it somebody else
7741940 i dont really care how they vote im going to appeal it anyway
7741941 im out of here i dont want to deal with these people
7741942 we just wanted to dedicate something in jim holmes name

7741944 this turned out to be a yelling match this is not what this mans memory should be about im very shocked tonight
7741945 i wouldnt particularly like to see this go forward as a legal case
7741946 i think we are in our right legally but do i want to push that point no id like to defuse the situation

7741955 nunca ning n piloto ha sido presionado para volar un avi n que no cumpliera los est ndares legales de aeronavegabilidad y seguridad las diferencias entre compa a y trabajadores se centran fundamentalmente en el nefasto modelo de gesti n empresarial y comercial que a nuestro juicio se viene aplicando desde hace a os
7741956 el uso sesgado y especulativo que por parte de cierto sector de la prensa se est haciendo de algunas comunicaciones escritas entre empresa y pilotos y anima a los medios de comunicaci n social a que no propaguen ni alienten informaciones especulativas sobre unos hechos que requieren de la necesaria investigaci n t cnica y judicial creemos que dichas pr cticas denigran la memoria de nuestros compa eros fallecidos por lo que solicitamos el respeto para las v ctimas y familiares de esta inesperada tragedia a rea que nos ha consternado a todos

7741962 lo que m s molesta a ryanair es que en otras webs el cliente pueda comparar los precios de sus vuelos con otras compa as y ver que no son los m s baratos como aseguran
7741963 no se ha producido nada nuevo en rumbo los clientes pueden seguir reservando los vuelos de ryanair sin ning n problema
7741964 nosotros actuamos en inter s del cliente que tiene la oportunidad de acceder a toda la informaci n sobre las distintas compa as a reas y elegir el vuelo que prefiera
7741965 es muy complicado llevar a cabo un filtrado por el que la compa a pueda identificar la procedencia de la reserva
7741966 ya tienen reservas para el pr ximo a o en las mismas fechas
7741967 algunos clientes antes de marcharse han reservado su habitaci n para asistir a la celebraci n del pr ximo gran premio de europa en valencia ya que saben que es un evento multitudinario y que tiene muchos seguidores entre la gente de alto poder adquisitivo
7741968 no s lo el nivel de ocupaci n es excelente
7741969 como este evento atrae a gente con un alto poder adquisitivo tambi n se ha producido una gran repercusi n en el precio medio

7741973 decir en este momento que el problema que motiv el primer retorno del avi n tiene conexi n que la puede tener o no con lo ocurrido es una frivolidad
7741974 en principio todo el mundo puede pensar que si se detect un primer problema a lo mejor es que no se regl bien y tuvo algo que ver pero puede ser que ocurriera as o que no

7742000 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7742001 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7742002 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7742003 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7742004 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7742005 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7742006 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7742007 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7742008 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7742009 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7742010 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7742011 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7742012 we were really lucky at that point we fielded a freshman team and some went to jv during the season a couple went up to varsity thats 30 kids who love soccer thats a good thing a contagious thing
7742013 our town is only two square miles weve been playing together since we were so young we all hang out in school and out of school
7742014 since weve been playing together for so long theres a lot of chemistry we know how each other plays and where theyll be its like being home its something weve always done
7742015 there arent that many pieces to fit in thats the difference between the wins and losses is the supporting cast thats going to be our key
7742016 starting out it was 30 when we all hang out its a very large group of girls
7742017 well hang out at someones house or we all go out together birthday parties theres a big crowd
7742018 we were really lucky at that point we fielded a freshman team and some went to jv during the season a couple went up to varsity thats 30 kids who love soccer thats a good thing a contagious thing
7742019 our town is only two square miles weve been playing together since we were so young we all hang out in school and out of school
7742020 since weve been playing together for so long theres a lot of chemistry we know how each other plays and where theyll be its like being home its something weve always done
7742021 there arent that many pieces to fit in thats the difference between the wins and losses is the supporting cast thats going to be our key
7742022 starting out it was 30 when we all hang out its a very large group of girls
7742023 well hang out at someones house or we all go out together birthday parties theres a big crowd
7742024 we were only really healthy for two games last year
7742025 but that happens you go through those years you cant cry about it we just go about our business but if we stay healthy this year well be all right
7742026 im not sweating right now if my quarterback can play in a game at the varsity level
7742027 i know he can he did a real nice job last year and maturity wise he is five times ahead of where he was last year
7742028 hes just so much more confident in himself he feels good about what hes doing i dont have to worry about anything with him
7742029 our senior class weve been together since we were 5 years old
7742030 we have a lot of chemistry if we all stay healthy i have a real positive feeling about the team this year
7742031 we were only really healthy for two games last year
7742032 but that happens you go through those years you cant cry about it we just go about our business but if we stay healthy this year well be all right
7742033 im not sweating right now if my quarterback can play in a game at the varsity level
7742034 i know he can he did a real nice job last year and maturity wise he is five times ahead of where he was last year
7742035 hes just so much more confident in himself he feels good about what hes doing i dont have to worry about anything with him
7742036 our senior class weve been together since we were 5 years old
7742037 we have a lot of chemistry if we all stay healthy i have a real positive feeling about the team this year
7742038 in a perfect world i would have loved to put haggerty up front from the beginning but we didnt have anybody else to play sweeper
7742039 a change had to be made and i knew he could do it hes a tremendous athlete very quick good with both feet big he could do it all
7742040 everybody played well together and stepped up all at once
7742041 it was really hard because i played basketball my entire life
7742042 when i went into high school i wasnt sure which one id excel in
7742043 but after playing for coach here i realized soccer was way go
7742044 in a perfect world i would have loved to put haggerty up front from the beginning but we didnt have anybody else to play sweeper
7742045 a change had to be made and i knew he could do it hes a tremendous athlete very quick good with both feet big he could do it all
7742046 everybody played well together and stepped up all at once
7742047 it was really hard because i played basketball my entire life
7742048 when i went into high school i wasnt sure which one id excel in
7742049 but after playing for coach here i realized soccer was way go
7742050 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7742051 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7742052 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7742053 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7742054 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7742055 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7742056 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7742057 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7742058 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7742059 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7742060 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7742061 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7742062 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7742063 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7742064 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7742065 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7742066 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7742067 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7742068 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7742069 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7742070 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7742071 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7742072 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7742073 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7742074 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7742075 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7742076 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7742077 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7742078 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7742079 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7742080 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7742081 moreover since bill is not and has not been for years gainfully employed he will be scrounging around for cash everywhere but that wouldnt be exactly new would it
7742082 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7742083 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7742084 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7742085 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7742086 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7742087 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7742088 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7742089 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7742090 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7742091 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7742092 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7742093 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7742094 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7742095 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7742096 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7742097 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7742098 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7742099 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7742100 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7742101 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7742102 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7742103 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7742104 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7742105 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7742106 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7742107 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7742108 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7742109 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7742110 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7742111 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7742112 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7742113 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7742114 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7742115 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7742116 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
7742117 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7742118 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
7742119 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7742120 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that
7742121 were not staying around for ever for you to get around to this you have to do it now overdue
7742122 help me out here madame speaker when does life begin
7742123 the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose roe v wade talks about very clear definitions of when the child first trimester certain considerations second trimester not so third trimester theres very clear distinctions
7742124 and if that in fact is a a a a good alternative then that is something that we should do
7742125 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7742126 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7742127 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7742128 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7742129 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7742130 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7742131 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7742132 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7742133 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7742134 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7742135 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7742136 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7742137 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7742138 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7742139 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7742140 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7742141 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7742142 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7742143 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7742144 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7742145 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7742146 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7742147 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7742148 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7742149 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7742150 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7742151 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7742152 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7742153 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7742154 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7742155 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7742156 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7742157 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7742158 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7742159 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7742160 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7742161 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7742162 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7742163 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7742164 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7742165 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7742166 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7742167 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7742168 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7742169 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7742170 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7742171 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7742172 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7742173 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7742174 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7742175 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7742176 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7742177 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7742178 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7742179 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7742180 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7742181 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7742182 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7742183 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7742184 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7742185 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7742186 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7742187 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7742188 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7742189 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7742190 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7742191 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7742192 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7742193 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7742194 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7742195 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7742196 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7742197 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7742198 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7742199 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7742200 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7742201 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7742202 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7742203 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7742204 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7742205 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7742206 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7742207 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7742208 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7742209 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
7742210 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
7742211 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
7742212 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
7742213 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7742214 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7742215 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7742216 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7742217 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7742218 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7742219 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7742220 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7742221 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7742222 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7742223 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7742224 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7742225 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7742226 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7742227 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7742228 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7742229 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7742230 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7742231 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7742232 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7742233 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7742234 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7742235 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7742236 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7742237 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7742238 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7742239 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7742240 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7742241 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7742242 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7742243 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7742244 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7742245 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7742246 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7742247 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7742248 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7742249 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7742250 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7742251 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7742252 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7742253 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7742254 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7742255 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7742256 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7742257 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7742258 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7742259 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7742260 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7742261 the boys are going well they won i think their first game since 2000 in south africa and an opportunity to win for the first time in almost 50 years at altitude and the tri nations
7742262 were a good chance at winning it so its a tough team to crack at the moment
7742263 but i think ive showed im not too far away and im playing well so ill just wait for a phone call
7742264 i was pretty happy with the way australia a went even though we lost the last game to lose the tournament
7742265 ive been playing a lot of footy so its just a matter of keeping myself on the park in terms of keeping my body right
7742266 this season just gone i thought the rugby we played was really good we just found ways not to win games and i think thats the key
7742267 all those teams at the table didnt play great rugby every week they just found ways to win and hopefully a tour like this the culture it builds will impart in the team the ability to find the way to win games

7742271 prices are not going up as a result of what were doing
7742272 prices will rise as a result of emissions trading they will rise as a result of actions of governments around the world to tackle climate change and gas emissions
7742273 the point is this if you increase the supply of electricity then you put a downward pressure on electricity prices
7742274 theres a national regulator these companies operate in a national market if theyre going to switch their power stations off then their competitors in victoria south australia and queensland and their other competitors in nsw will supply their electricity
7742275 the second point is the national regulator holds back around 850 megawatts of power
7742276 if theres a company or power station that wants to play games theres penalties but the reserve trading capacity of the national regulator can come in and have that electricity supplied
7742277 thirdly making a return on behalf of shareholders whats the best way to do that get more customers and thats exactly whats happening
7742278 and there is a simple reason i got elected to do what is right not necessarily what is popular
7742279 the easy thing would have been to not have taken action but that would have been the wrong thing by nsw
7742280 we have party meetings commencing tomorrow we have shadow cabinet on thursday and a joint party meeting on thursday and well have a vote on thursday or friday whenever mr iemma brings it on
7742281 im confident about my colleagues their vote will as usual be worked out within our party room structure and well be ready to vote when the legislation is put on either thursday or friday
7742282 ive invited a number of people to offer their views to me i invited the business community in this afternoon to see me
7742283 ill listen to that advice ill listen to the advice i get as i walk down the street today and on thursday therell be a decision
7742284 i dont think barry realises how close he is coming to seriously getting the business community offside
7742285 he is going to have some serious navel gazing to do if he plans to sell it off when he is premier but opposed it in 2008
7742286 seven has kept the accc regularly updated on its purchase of shares in wan and this review was foreshadowed by the accc some time ago seven said in a statement today
7742287 seven co operating in the review does not indicate any intention to acquire further shares in wan which seven regards as an important investment
7742288 under the corporations act seven is obliged to publicly notify changes in its shareholding which it will continue to notify to the market as required
7742289 pebble beach and those kinds of trophy assets its clear those were crazy deals but now theyre buying things that are earnings enhancing and using cash thats been generating no income to do it said london based scott mcglashan who manages japanese stocks for j o hambro capital management
7742290 its a very opportune time for japanese companies looking to make acquisitions overseas
7742291 in general m amp a doesnt benefit the acquirer because it tends to occur during boom times when management is overconfident and they pay too much said seiichiro iwasawa chief strategist at tokyo based nomura securities
7742292 japan is unique because they remember their massive bubble era failures and have such low confidence that they are being extremely careful to do deals that make sense
7742293 the deals are nowhere near as accretive as returning cash to shareholders or buying domestic competitors and profiting through consolidation and cost saving he said
7742294 give me six hours to chop down a tree and i will spend the first four sharpening the axe
7742295 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7742296 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7742297 a heavily armed group infiltrators cut the fence and entered the indian territory they were heading toward jammu and a massive manhunt has been launched to nab them
7742298 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7742299 no official announcement has been made about pradeep gandhis return to the party fold
7742300 election control cell being set up by the state party headquarters
7742301 we will upgrade the cyber security of our computer lab
7742302 though we have been conducting workshops on cyber crimes for our faculty we will now take more steps towards cyber security since computers are available to students as well
7742303 in the light of what has happened we are definitely reworking our internet security we are studying the details and also talking to our in house it professionals
7742304 we definitely need more internal security and are going to talk to our computer experts about increasing it
7742305 a case has been registered against the malaysian social service a chennai based private company licensed by the indian government for having sent at least 120 children for adoption abroad our investigations found a simple modus operandi street children were kidnapped for a mere rs 500 and given for adoption abroad for sums ranging from as low as rs 10 000 to as high as 10 000 per child
7742306 obviously kidnapped children have been passed off by impostors claiming to be their mothers donating them for adoption their real parents may not even be aware where their children are and may not have received a single rupee as compensation
7742307 while bringing the guilty to book may be a problem due to the absence of complainants disturbing children living abroad with emotional moorings may prove counterproductive as none of them would like to return to a poverty stricken life back home
7742308 there are many examples of cultivable land being used for other purposes
7742309 if the farmers are getting good money then where is the problem
7742310 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7742311 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7742312 as a revolutionary bhagat singh was known to sport a european hat the bust doesnt do justice to his persona during that historic period family members were not consulted on the statue
7742313 bhagat singh did not wear a turban for three years between 1928 till he was hanged on march 23 1931 and he did not have a beard
7742314 four real pictures were available to the government and were handed over to the parliamentary committee
7742315 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7742316 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7742317 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7742318 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7742319 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7742320 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7742321 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7742322 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7742323 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7742324 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

7742330 for future major road construction projects fine gael wants all roads to remain in public ownership so that the massive waste of taxpayers money and congestion problems associated with the west link will never happen again
7742331 the private sector can still design build finance maintain and even operate tolls but operational control needs to remain with the government
7742332 the taxpayers have already paid 500m for the west link and are now being fleeced on the double
7742333 a toll is only supposed to be introduced if there is a viable alternative road until the outer orbital route is introduced no such alternative exists
7742334 a ppp is a fancy way of financing roads to keep them off the balance sheet but will prove more costly
7742335 tolls are an extremely inefficient way of raising revenue and have all sorts of negative consequences
7742336 we could not continue supporting the government after mr zardari failed to honour his promise to restore the judges
7742337 we are only interested in buying the club outright rather than pumping money in with arkaga still in place
7742338 its a brilliant draw with the two best supported teams in
7742339 weve cork in the league next week and the last match i lost with derry in the cup was against cork in turners cross so its always a big game for us
7742340 you must give yourself every opportunity were not going to raise the white flag by switching it to dalymount especially when you have the option of going to bray
7742341 well probably go for sunday too as thats when we normally play the last time we played bohs over the two games we made 9 000 which was massive for us
7742342 yes we are off our all time low of last month but it would have to be sustained to have any kind of effect
7742343 a lot of the improvement seems to have come about from people perceiving it may be a better time to buy major household items so there may well be a summer sales effect in there
7742344 i think if the consumers see the government was making a serious effort to ensure that prices were being kept as limited as possible it would have an effect on boosting confidence
7742345 i think its about time they showed they are back at their desks and that they are working on behalf of consumers to make a very difficult situation somewhat easier
7742346 although confidence is fragile consumers are at least capable of taking comfort in a number of slightly encouraging developments
7742347 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7742348 we dont do things by half in woodford the area he is from we dont do civic receptions but well have a bit of craic i want it for all the little kids really
7742349 i didnt send out any invitations but they will probably come
7742350 obviously he will be very tired coming back it is a long journey we will meet him at the airport and find out what he wants to do
7742351 there can be no question of simply putting the same proposition to the people once again
7742352 there is no basis for believing that a second referendum would produce a different outcome to the one we got on june 12
7742353 minister roches comments may simply have the effect of driving even more people into the no camp
7742354 the only initiative they have come up with was a totally futile plan to set up a new committee which would duplicate the work of the existing committee on european affairs
7742355 there is no political crisis as minister roche has suggested
7742356 there is simply a political task to be dealt with the irish people like the french and dutch before them rejected this treaty a new deal now needs to be negotiated
7742357 i think he is jumping the gun i dont think its helpful we may have to say at the end of the day that the people have spoken and take the consequences but i dont think its helpful to be coming out in the month of august with proposals or solutions one way or the other
7742358 concerns over social and moral issues taxation and representation on the european commission
7742359 rather than threatening to ram another referendum down peoples throats
7742360 im going to wexford on friday week for the first late late show
7742361 i had a planning meeting to discuss the first show its going to be a spectacular show all sorts of weird and wonderful things
7742362 it will be the inauguration of the new opera house and i hope to go down to see it before i actually arrive down to do the show maybe next weekend i might motor carefully down to see it
7742363 it is more about learning for life than learning to pass the test
7742364 i think the other man omahony overreacted and its something similar to what we see in other games on tv
7742365 i feel sorry for donnacha who was harshly done by he was walked into it and apparently he had to put up with some fierce verbal abuse
7742366 lots of people dont realise the verbal abuse in certain matches
7742367 at county board level we are very friendly with the kerry lads but the two teams have met so often over the last five years that it seems familiarity breeds contempt
7742368 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7742369 a little ironic when some of our hospitals such as cork university maternity hospital have commissioned a state of the art robotic surgical system but do not have a website
7742370 each hospital should have its own website telling the public about the good things that it does if we are moving towards a world class health system the patient is also a consumer
7742371 i think people want to buy local to support economy and they feel safer knowing where the food is coming from
7742372 i was about five to ten feet away from it
7742373 we were just yelling the whole time chupacabra chupacabra which is like a mythical creature in mexico or something
7742374 it was all mangled it had a long tail and it couldnt have been a fox because the tail wasnt bushy its legs were too long

7742377 harry williams is currently in the post surgical recovery phase at presbyterian hospital dallas and will remain under observation
7742378 given the severity and depth of the injury to his neck and spine it is highly unlikely that harry will return to football
7742379 harry was fixing to be a big part of this team and have a chance in his career that he had really earned
7742380 to go out there on that field and see that kid laying there and what he went through i think its just the reality of how tough this game is and what can happen to you on any given play i just thank the good lord that the kid is going to be fine

7742385 they want to see if there is any interest there
7742386 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7742387 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7742388 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7742389 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7742390 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7742391 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7742392 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7742393 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7742394 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7742395 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7742396 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7742397 they want to see if there is any interest there
7742398 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7742399 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all

7742401 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that

7742407 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7742408 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat
7742409 he is another one of those infectious personalities so his personality and his mind state are always going to be at the utmost highest so i am not worried about him on that point
7742410 if they kill our revered leaders in such a brutal manner the people will react in any manner to vent their anger we cannot restrain them
7742411 the massive and peaceful peoples protest which is continuing in the jammu region is not only unique but unparalleled in the history of democractic movements in the country
7742412 people from every segment of society including those from every community and faith came out with the indian flag to protest against this meek surrender by the upa before patently anti india demands
7742413 neither hindu versus muslim nor jammu versus the kashmir valley it is essentially nationalist versus separatist
7742414 the nationalist elements in the kashmir valley read farooq and omar abdullahs must rise to the occasion and firmly speak against the voice of secession which is only being encouraged from across the border

7742431 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7742432 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7742433 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7742434 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7742435 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7742436 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7742437 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are going to do
7742438 i feel pretty good about my chances especially now that ive got one of the finest statesmen in this country on my ticket joe biden as vice president
7742439 nuclear is not green is not safe and has no role in western australias future energy mix

7742447 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the senate
7742448 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7742449 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7742450 for him it is a joyful passing before he was sick he specifically said its time for a new generation and he said that obama reminded him of his brother look this is a powerful moment in the history of the party
7742451 senator kennedy realized as i do that when you have been in this business for a while as a progressive politician you dont want to retire the trophy
7742452 you want to hand it over to the next generation fresh troops on the field ready to fight for the things that you have believed in all your life
7742453 the symbolism of taking the torch from the kennedys and saying its time to pass it on was remarkable it was one of the magic moments of the convention
7742454 i think kennedy and obama have the same message of hope
7742455 the invoking of his brothers generation was perfect political symbolism to someone who came of age with the kennedys
7742456 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7742457 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7742458 put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7742459 the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago

7742517 there is a common misconception that the sith access the force through evil or that being a sith lord automatically means that you are evil
7742518 and it was okay i still think that while i do like mitchs voice he should be the one to go home this week i think hes got a career ahead of him but i think he needs a little more development
7742519 and i liked it a lot i love the quality of his voice
7742520 and while he sang it well i found my attention drifting away during the performance it may not be his fault though since the song was not one of my favorites
7742521 and it was soulful and emotion filled i thought it was great
7742522 and i think it was a good choice for his voice

7742530 the darkest in an attempt to bring order to the world the government funded a company to make little robots that would clean on august 4th 1997 one of them became aware
7742531 but first they gave me this two pack of go dusters theyre motorized you see but non sentient they only operate under my control that makes me a cyborg
7742532 im a freak you see a tortured misunderstood freak and yet i can also work on vertical blinds electronics and furniture also theres multi surface spray included
7742533 but mine traps dust on the duster head and thats how i fight skyoomba trying to prevent it from coming to life
7742534 no no curse them im too late theres nothing i can do but try to create the warrior that will through struggle overcome skyoomba and redeem our future hurry i know a cheap motel where we can get started tonight
7742535 but but the future let me embrace you with my go duster two pack arms
7742536 it is important for me to go to work knowing that i am doing good of some sort in the world at the very least i dont want to be causing harm how are these concerns resolved in the law firm environment
7742537 in a civilized society law floats in a sea of ethics
7742538 shumang leela provides an artist with a source of livelihood besides providing a career option for the artist as well while in the theatre the chance of earning livelihood is very bleak as only the big directors earn while there is no scope for the artists at least in manipur
7742539 our aim and objective of organising this workshop is to preserve promote and propagate this kind of traditional theatre form
7742540 children are pillars of the nation and if the militants keep doing these evil activities they will ruin the childrens life so it will not bring any good to the nation
7742541 i really dont like such kind of atmosphere it affects our studies
7742542 the activities of militants have hampered development its because of them the people of manipur are suffering
7742543 in future i would like to see manipur to be very developed and all should be in unity

7742548 a person who loses a classmate will deal with the death differently than someone who loses a life partner
7742549 i understand youve lost someone dear to your life but i dont want to lose someone dear to mine
7742550 i guess it comes down to the same issue as whether it is on a beach or a cemetery
7742551 those who have children who dont have dogs would they feel safe if there were dogs not on a lead i dont think the cemetery is any different to any other public place the same issues apply
7742552 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7742553 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7742554 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7742555 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7742556 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7742557 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7742558 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7742559 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7742560 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7742561 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7742562 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7742563 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7742564 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7742565 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7742566 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7742567 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7742568 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7742569 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7742570 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7742571 following my suspension by the general medical council i have been informed that the greater glasgow and clyde health board has taken legal advice and may cancel my contract to provide medical services this means i will no longer be able to work as a general practitioner at all in future my staff will also lose their jobs
7742572 necessary to send a message to the medical profession that this behaviour is unacceptable
7742573 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act
7742574 they indicated that they were considering terminating my contract and since then ive been told that they are looking at it quite seriously
7742575 obviously i dont want that to happen im 62 now and dont think i could cope with starting up a new practice i understand there will be another meeting next week but have been told not to expect good news

7742582 this is advocating common good to change systems to help us all
7742583 whether comments or questions are allowed is in the discretion of the board and according to policies it might adopt
7742584 it is not illegal for the board to have a regimen that citizens must follow to speak at a meeting
7742585 nothing in the freedom of information act requires a public body to provide an opportunity for public comment
7742586 i contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself out by the handle

7742593 a happy man or woman is a better thing to find than a five pound courteous professional and effective in dealings with senior executives 6533
7742594 in picking sen joe biden to be his running mate barack obama sought to shore up his weakness inexperience in office and on foreign policy rather than underscore his strength as a new generation candidate defying political conventions
7742595 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7742596 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over sen john mccain
7742597 something profound about obama for all his self confidence the 47 year old illinois senator worried that he couldnt beat republican john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack the biden selection is the next logistical step in an obama campaign that has become more negative a strategic decision that may be necessary but threatens to run counter to his image
7742598 the biggest thing barack obama has ever run is his own presidential campaign
7742599 the 47 year old illinois senator is asking voters to look beyond his thin r sum and conclude that he has the wisdom and toughness to be president the economy terrorism health care he hopes voters will trust him with all that and more
7742600 thats a lot to ask for someone who just a few years ago was an obscure member of the illinois legislature
7742601 we have more gas than the mine is actually utilizing
7742602 we want to know whats next and how we can best utilize that resource is it generating power is it putting it into a natural gas pipeline is it trying to draw in another industry that might be able to use that and bring jobs to the area theres a lot of options and we just want to look at them all
7742603 at this point in the study well be looking for information and historical data that people in augusta may have
7742604 daniel field was sort of the center point for a wide area from here to fort gordon for world war i and ii training sites
7742605 there were no actual facilities on daniel field itself where they used weapons but theyve identified areas around here that were used for rifle ranges and that sort of thing
7742606 wrightsboro road and wheeless road now highland avenue ran through the camp which featured nine miles of clay and sand roads
7742607 in its final configuration camp hancock could accommodate 45 099 troops the highest number of troops in camp in any one month was 35 148 in october 1918
7742608 we want people to tell us where things took place and what we may want to look for
7742609 our contractor would determine if there is any danger from unexploded ordnance and decide if any actions are needed
7742610 if there is something that could cause risk we may need to post warning signs or actually go out and conduct ground penetrating investigation
7742611 one area was on an old mortar range and we were blowing stuff up literally just a few feet from peoples foundations
7742612 we were telling them not to dig in their gardens
7742613 but if someone finds something they should remember the three rs of unexploded munitions recognize retreat and report
7742614 if you could write a letter to yourself regarding your personal relationships what would you say
7742615 times are hard there aint no jobs in augusta and you gotta do what you gotta do
7742616 and you know its got to be rough for the people on the bottom
7742617 if you cant work after 6 oclock at night no one needs you
7742618 i guess they feel like in their heart of hearts i let them down
7742619 most of the people in there dont want to be there
7742620 no more of my money going to a service that doesnt benefit me wont cant benefit me and more importantly is going to squander my tax dollars

7742622 no more of my money going to a service that doesnt benefit me wont cant benefit me and more importantly is going to squander my tax dollars

7742631 tamb m queremos que nossas crian as e que as crian as de toda esta na o saibam que o nico limite na busca de seu pr prio sucesso s o seus sonhos e a vontade de trabalhar por eles
7742632 estou aqui como uma filha criada na zona sul de chicago por um pai que era um oper rio e uma m e que ficava em casa com meu irm o e eu
7742633 o amor de minha m e sempre foi uma for a revigorante para nossa fam lia e uma de minhas maiores alegrias ver sua integridade sua compaix o e sua intelig ncia refletidas em minhas filhas
7742634 iam a matar a obama desde um ponto elevado utilizando uma espingarda
7742635 only four and older only four and older can play
7742636 im not three im four im four i can play
7742637 right there thats where i made my stand that was my hill
7742638 you know what mellissa youre selfish and greedy and dont think about anyone else but yourself you deserve losing all your friends and getting evicted you did this to yourself and i hope you revel in your dispair because its all youve got now
7742639 i aint pro human because all humans aint pro black
7742640 because i believe that each of us no matter what our age or background or walk of life each of us has something to contribute to the life of this nation
7742641 hell achieve these goals the same way he always has by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7742642 what kind of legal system lets a psychologist test a spanish speaking kid with an i q test in english something was wrong here and what kind of defense lawyer tells a boy that if his family comes up with 4000 it would take him just a month to get that boy home you could buy your way out of trouble with a clever lawyer and expensive psychiatrists but they are out of reach of the poor whites and blacks and hispanics that crowd americas lockups
7742643 i like the red shoes but whats most important to me is that youre happy
7742644 if you havent done anything wrong you dont have anything to worry about
7742645 thereve been too many times when ive drown you with these perfect lines

7742647 as the new home for the artwork and documents for the running fence the smithsonian american art museum is now the institution of record for this pivotal project
7742648 this acquisition measurably strengthens the museums commitment to major artists who have made an indelible mark on american art and culture

7742650 lida abduls video works bring to light the poignant stoicism of how the people of afghanistan are dealing with a long history of violence
7742651 as an encyclopedic museum with a robust contemporary program the ima is uniquely able to show how artists across time have examined the current events of their lives through their work
7742652 why cant a ruin itself be transformed into a meditation on something other a non referential work of art a visual or sculptural poem that one hopes will open up new spaces for rethinking about society about ethics and identity itself
7742653 abduls video works offer counter representations to the images of kabul and afghanistan that permeate news media throughout the united states and europe
7742654 ruin and devastation are pictured but abdul adds to the scene an utterly human aspect reflecting upon the physical displacement and psychological trauma experienced by those who live there

7742656 our monitoring shows the start of a change in driving patterns and behaviour
7742657 average motorway speeds have reduced as well as congestion which indicates a reduction in the volume of vehicles especially lorries
7742658 one explanation is that rising fuel prices and economic concerns are making people think about how they drive
7742659 the fall in congestion is good news in an otherwise bleak picture
7742660 but this altered pattern of demand can only be a breathing space for policymakers and does not remove the case for investment in congestion busting measures

7742729 los alumnos de primer ano llegan a la universidad con muchas inquietudes ideas y entusiasmos que canalizadas de manera adecuada son un motor trascendental que estimula sus aprendizajes motivados por cumplir los fines de sus planes los alumnos producen saberes y habilidades tecnicas y sociales que se vinculan a un desempeno profesional competente en ingenieria
7742730 bender es un robot funcional que mediante algoritmos puede movilizarse y actuar frente a diferentes obstaculos presentados en la trayectoria del mismo si el robot detecta un objeto en su camino como la cajetilla este lo tomara mediante un mecanismo de agarre que consta de dos servomotores que suben y bajan o aprietan y sueltan respectivamente
7742731 bender es un robot que se compone de piezas trascendentales a destacar como la placa basic stamp que se programa en lenguaje pbasic y es la encargada de mover los servomotores a traves de pulsos y la placa arduino modelo diecimilla que envia senales logicas al basic stamp dependiendo de la lectura de los sensores infrarrojos que miden distancia chasis y ruedas
7742732 si el proyecto se llegara a realizar a gran escala creemos que podria favorecer a muchas empresas que buscan automatizacion y rapidez en su produccion nos gustaria seguir trabajando en bender incluyendo muchas mas funciones con el proposito de que pueda realizar diversas tareas y resolver una gran cantidad de problemas nuestra expectativa es seguir formandonos como ingenieros que ponen en practica lo aprendido y no se quedan solo con la teoria que es lo que requiere el mundo actual aunque no todos poseen
7742733 la metodologia de planes genera situaciones de aprendizaje trascendentales y motivadoras donde los alumnos adquieren y aplican saberes al mismo tiempo que producen cualidades trascendentales del perfil de los ingenieros

7742735 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7742736 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7742737 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7742738 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7742739 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7742740 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7742741 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things i dont want to look back on my career and think i only won the carling league cup
7742742 i want to push on and win more and thats one of the reasons why i came to liverpool another reason is the fact that ive always been a fan and if i could win something with this team it would be a dream come true

7742793 how are we gonna do that its hopeless unless we triple the salt in our pulled pork sandwiches mmmm salt
7742794 i think people would notice and it wouldnt lure more people anyway
7742795 hey we could lower our prices so theyre below the insane level of the fair that would bring in lots of customers
7742796 and we could sprinkle it with sea salt if the combination of bacon and chocolate doesnt get them the extra salt will
7742797 who ever heart of dipping bacon in chocolate its insane
7742798 whoever heard of dipping a snickers bar in batter and deep frying it on a stick

7742849 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7742850 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7742851 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7742852 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work

7742863 no es f cil muchas veces nos salimos del camino sobre todo cuando hay vac os como una falta de pol tica energ tica en chile que est a expensas del mercado y de lo que digan las empresas pero si nosotros como regi n le exigimos a nuestro pa s estar en esa mesa podemos dar los primeros pasos para lograr una pol tica energ tica
7742864 su impacto ser en al menos 372 predios afectados muchos m s hacia norte del pa s una cicatriz tremenda imborrable con una gran cantidad de reas silvestres protegidas afectadas
7742865 se produce p rdida de la biodiversidad acu tica de las pesquer as r o arriba y abajo y de los servicios brindados por las planicies de inundaci n r o abajo por los humedales y por los ecosistemas de las riberas y estuarios adyacentes adem s hay p rdida de bosques y de h bitats naturales de poblaciones de especies y la degradaci n de las cuencas r o arriba debido a la inundaci n de la zona de los embalses tambi n se generan impactos acumulativos en la calidad del agua en las inundaciones naturales y en la composici n de las especies cuando en el mismo r o se construyen varias represas
7742866 aumento de problemas mentales y f sicos hay inadecuados programas de mitigaci n reasentamiento y desarrollo para desplazados la permanente desconsideraci n comunidades aguas abajo de represas han conducido al empobrecimiento y sufrimiento de millones y son los grupos m s pobres y vulnerables y las generaciones futuras las que deber n soportar costos sociales y ambientales sin obtener proporcionalmente beneficios econ micos
7742867 ha generado el desplazamiento 40 a 80 millones de personas de las reas de construcci n e inundaci n y los problemas sociales generados golpean m s cruelmente a las mujeres
7742868 hay una serie de problemas que se han identificado con el propio estudio por ejemplo ste considera zonas de an lisis muy limitadas sin tomar en cuenta las comunidades cercanas como tortel ni la cuenca como un todo ni hacia la regi n de magallanes falta informaci n sobre caudales sedimentaci n y per odos de retorno de los r os que pueden provocar accidentes con los embalses hay diversos elementos que son de suma gravedad que permiten decir que a este estudio le faltan muchas cosas

7742879 quickbooks online is perfect for us as there is no office just volunteer member parents working from various home or work offices
7742880 given the virtual nature of our interactions iphone support helps us be more productive while waiting for an appointment i was able to check quickbooks online using my iphone to look up parents with open balances and send them an e mail reminder to pay their bill
7742881 a growing number of small businesses are looking to mobile technology to run their business
7742882 our goal with these new mobile services is to give quickbooks online users the edge they need to compete and manage their busy lives by keeping tabs on their business even when they are out of the office
7742883 the iphone utilizes direct push to synchronize with microsoft exchange so we have expanded the conversion utility of our emailgateway component so it extends to the aiff and cif file formats native to the iphone we already had extended the utility to take into account symbians native wav and amr formats so iphone support was the natural next step in our efforts to remain at the forefront of the mobility push taking place in the global legal community at present
7742884 having been first to support blackberry dictation after the release of their sound supporting operating system 4 2 it is testament to the technical expertise and client driven philosophy within our development team that they are now leading the way with iphone sound format support just as that device starts to gain in popularity there is no doubt this will be of use to organizations who are now starting to have iphone requests from individual business users for the first time and whose users do not want to carry or the firm pay for multiple dictation devices
7742885 our new mobile icc solution frees call center managers and executives from their workstations so they can manage critical issues wherever they are

7742889 the 1st amendments right to the free exercise of religion does not exempt defendant physicians here from conforming their conduct to the anti discrimination requirements even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defe ndants religious beliefs
7742890 we are particularly concerned that the draft guidelines might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7742891 we understand that you intend to finalize and sign next week the draft attorney general guidelines intended to govern fbi criminal national security and foreign intelligence investigations
7742892 we have a number of questions and concerns about the guidelines and urge you not to sign them until members of congress experts in the relevant fields and affected communities have had a full opportunity to provide detailed input

7742917 i would not be here today if i thought there was a health risk from quarry operations
7742918 they have done things like sweep the streets of dust and limited hours of operations
7742919 i have complained that at times i cannot breathe and when the blasting goes off it rattles my windows and home
7742920 ive documented the hell that its been to live near the quarry
7742921 significant unavoidable impacts on air quality including a contribution to significant unavoidable cumulative human health risks
7742922 we will be signing the reimbursement agreement with the city of azusa in early april

7742937 this is not going to be an overnight fix by any means
7742938 this is not something thats going to be resolved by summer or even the next year
7742939 we have car deer accidents infectious disease possibilities and for lack of a better term vandalism
7742940 its not the fault of the city the city didnt do anything wrong but i think its 100 percent our responsibility
7742941 one could argue that one crash increases the safety concerns anytime there is a car deer crash there is a potential for injury
7742942 i think there will be some negative reaction to sharpshooters although most of the communities ive worked with have said its very short lived
7742943 i think as it becomes an accepted practice that negative response goes away
7742944 one of the things that the committee discussed was coming up with a strategy that would be successful in the long term
7742945 aku suka dia karena orangnya cuek aku juga jadi cocok
7742946 our hearts are heavy at this moment for the two deceased individuals including one of our own employees and the additional injured workers
7742947 most of the errors that we find with the destruction of cranes with cranes falling is from the fact that we dont have certified operators out there operating these cranes

7742951 the number of people who have become more active and visible on the national political front has increased dramatically because people have suddenly sensed that they have to defend themselves as americans defend themselves as arabs and muslims
7742952 the senators voted 3 2 not to let our bills out of committee and it doesnt look like they will ever get to the senate floor for actual vote
7742953 we told them that while the quarry owner rogers group is good corporate citizen we should have a say in where they locate
7742954 if a quarry is so good then maybe they need another one in morgan county he doesnt need to tell us how to run our county
7742955 is why did rogers group bring stacy george in to talk about it
7742956 certainly we would urge all hauliers and transport companies to look at their procedures and do all they can to minimise accidents these types of measures could help prevent more deaths on the road as well as costly legal proceedings
7742957 the more your procedures are beyond criticism the better that sort of thing is to be applauded and i will say to my other clients think about this it will put you in a better position
7742958 this is a strategic decision for caterpillar and it is an important part of our comprehensive business strategy for competing and winning in the rapidly expanding emerging markets of asia and the commonwealth of independent states
7742959 our joint venture with mitsubishi heavy industries has been remarkably successful and moving forward im confident that as scm is fully integrated with caterpillars core operations our customers will see greater benefits from this agreement
7742960 although mhis shareholding stake in scm will decrease as a result of the change in ownership structure mhi intends on further enhancing its value by strategically focusing its management resources on mhis core competency businesses with high growth potential
7742961 the trusted relationship we cultivated with caterpillar over the years will be maintained and further developed after this transaction
7742962 scm and its employees are proud to be part of team caterpillar and this agreement will allow scms manufacturing design and process expertise to be fully leveraged across the global caterpillar enterprise
7742963 het was een heel positieve en serene vergadering waarop de wedstrijd van zondag in alle openheid is geanalyseerd
7742964 geen zoektocht naar schuldigen wel naar een verklaring voor het collectief falen dan kom je bij een grotere wil om te winnen bij de thuisploeg uit bergen startte scherper en zoiets krijg je bijna nooit rechtgezet in een wedstrijd
7742965 niemand wint in belgi nog een wedstrijd op talent zelfs anderlecht niet kwaliteit moet gekoppeld worden aan een enorme wedstrijdmentaliteit zoals standard dat al een poos demonstreert dat ontbrak bij ons en zoiets zou ons niet alleen in bergen kunnen overkomen maar pakweg ook op dender of in tubeke daarom is het belangrijk om meteen de puntjes op de i te zetten
7742966 wij hebben een enorme inspanning gedaan om de spelersgroep te versterken wij verwachten van hen zaterdag een krachtige respons ik reken op meer scherpte zoals dat bijvoorbeeld in de oefenpot op willem ii getoond werd daar werd gebikkeld wonnen we w l de afvallende bal misschien moeten we meer van dergelijke wedstrijden spelen in de voorbereiding al krijg je zon match natuurlijk nooit op bestelling
7742967 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7742968 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7742969 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7742970 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7742971 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7742972 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7742973 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7742974 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7742975 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7742976 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7742977 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7742978 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7742979 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7742980 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7742981 renno roelandt lid van het boic riep herhaaldelijk vuile zwarte wanneer een nigeriaanse voetballer een fout maakte op een belgische speler tijdens de wedstrijd nigeria belgi we volgden de match op groot scherm op de belgische ambassade in beijing
7742982 vuile zwarte riep renno roelandt lid van het boic herhaaldelijk wanneer een nigeriaanse voetballer een fout maakte op een belgische speler tijdens de wedstrijd nigeria belgi we volgden de match op groot scherm op de belgische ambassade in beijing
7742983 toen eerst mijn vrouw en dan ikzelf hierover duidelijk ons ongenoegen uitten ging het gesprek letterlijk verder als volgt
7742984 ik voel me werkelijk gevleid dat jij mij terechtwijst trouwens als jij eens met zwarten zou gewerkt hebben in brussel zou je wel anders praten
7742985 laat maar dit is te zielig om verder over te praten
7742986 het afscheid doet pijn maar we zijn dankbaar voor de vele mooie jaren die we samen hebben gehad
7742987 hij was mijn grote broer die zes jaar ouder was en naar wie ik opkeek hij wandelde iedere dag met mij en mijn twee andere broers naar school het sint jozefscollege in hasselt na het overlijden van onze ouders heeft hij de rol van pater familias voor een groot stuk overgenomen hij zorgde ervoor dat we als familie samenbleven
7742988 hij ging regelmatig met ons neefjes en nichtjes naar het dierenpark of wandelen in de ardennen dat waren plezante tijden
7742989 paul had een grote bezorgdheid voor de minderbedeelden en ieder jaar droeg hij met kerstmis een mis op in de gevangenis van hasselt en luisterde hij naar de verhalen van de gedetineerden
7742990 hij is ook verschillende keren naar rwanda geweest om de missionarissen een hart onder de riem te steken na zijn pensioen wilde hij zelf naar afrika gaan om er actief missionariswerk te verrichten alles was geregeld maar zijn gezondheid liet het niet meer toe
7742991 paul kon eindeloos vertellen over de tweede wereldoorlog die hij bewust had meegemaakt nadat een verdwaalde bom op de olv basiliek in hasselt was gevallen is hij ernaar toe gegaan om hulp te bieden als vijftienjarige stond hij daar tussen het puin de doden en gewonden
7742992 hij vertelde ook vaak het verhaal van de fiets ooit had een duitse soldaat de fiets van zijn vader opge ist toen zijn vader die nadien wilde terugnemen kwam het tot een woordenwisseling waarbij de soldaat zijn revolver trok nonkel paul heeft altijd gezegd als ik mijn vader niet gekalmeerd had dan had de duitser hem ter plekke doodgeschoten dat is een moment in zijn leven dat hem fel heeft aangegrepen
7742993 de oorlog was verschrikkelijk we zijn verschillende keren gevlucht voor de duitsers paul heeft ons verteld hoe onze vader op zoek ging naar eten over hoe hij een biefstuk gesneden had uit een dood paard dat in de vijvers van kiewit lag we hebben dat vlees moeten koken omdat er geen bakboter was
7742994 hij was erg sportief hij wandelde en fietste graag in zijn jeugdjaren voetbalde hij ook niet bij een echte club gewoon bij de ksa ploeg hij stond bekend als een harde verdediger die zijn voet nooit terugtrok sport kon hem altijd boeien hij keek naar wielrennen tennis en voetbal op televisie en hij bleef tot op het laatste moment supporter van excelsior hasselt het huidige ksk hasselt
7742995 de laatste jaren verloor hij soms zijn ori ntatie we waren altijd ongerust als hij op zijn eentje ging wandelen maar paul zei altijd er overkomt mij niets ik ben in gods handen dat moet haast wel want hij heeft in zijn leven veel geluk gehad toen hij drie jaar was werd hij getroffen door hersenvliesontsteking maar hij overleefde de zware ziekte in de jaren 70 is hij ooit met een bootje gekapseisd in het meer van b tgenbach en hebben ze hem uit het ijskoude water moeten halen
7742996 en hij is eens door een houten brug gezakt en heeft daarbij zijn twee polsen gebroken
7742997 zijn meter tante b atrix heeft paul gezegd dat hij op bedevaart moest gaan als dankbetuiging dat hij de hersenvliesontsteking had overleefd hij heeft dat gedaan en tijdens die bedevaart heeft tante b atrix gebeden dat paul priester zou worden
7742998 het was niet verwonderlijk dat hij dat ook is geworden paul was diepgelovig eerst wilde hij naar een trappistenabdij gaan maar uiteindelijk heeft hij toch voor het seminarie gekozen
7742999 ik weet dat zijn eerste auto een daf was maar eigenlijk heeft nonkel paul nooit goed kunnen autorijden gas geven remmen gas geven remmen ik kwam altijd ziek uit de auto
7743000 toch heeft hij nooit een ongeval gehad en hij geraakte ook overal waar hij moest zijn
7743001 onderweg nam hij vaak lifters mee omdat hij hun verhaal wilde horen hij luisterde naar iedereen
7743002 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7743003 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7743004 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7743005 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7743006 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7743007 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7743008 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7743009 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7743010 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7743011 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7743012 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7743013 despite taking significant number of potential toublemakers off the streets and seizing dozens of weapons a small minority still managed to marr the end of what had been a largely good natured and peaceful two days of celebrations
7743014 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7743015 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7743016 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7743017 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7743018 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7743019 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7743020 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7743021 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline
7743022 how to make the world notice your video game blog
7743023 bowser takes peach mario chases after bowser bowser falls into some lava the end
7743024 concedes that drilling is a false solution but we need to expand the debate beyond drilling and find real solutions for rising gas prices
7743025 ceding the point that he doesnt have the foreign policy experience to be president
7743026 you reflect the immediate gratification pose of an anxious teenager when you suggest that drilling for oil today will not affect supply for 10 years

7743036 in the final analysis pakistan will only be as strong as its political system
7743037 informed and unimpeded debate on the 21 year old drinking age
7743038 the ads have youth believing that participating in major league sports or skiing surfing or mountain climbing go hand in hand with alcohol
7743039 we want to put more dollars into driving consumer choice and offering them what they want
7743040 if that means raising our advertising and spending against our brands to get that done we have to get that done
7743041 taxation restricted access and advertising bans were the most cost effective policy options in reducing harmful alcohol use which includes binge drinking
7743042 the argument for offshore oil drilling has focused wrongly on current gasoline prices
7743043 the argument against oil drilling has also wrongly focused on the potential environmental disasters in store from offshore drilling
7743044 at least i thought the environmental disaster argument was wrong because it misses a larger point investing in oil now is like deciding its a good time to get into the subprime mortgage business the game ending and youve already lost
7743045 offshore exploration opponents point out that if the federal drilling ban were lifted today thered be no immediate effect on gasoline prices it could take 10 years to get any crude to the gas pump fine most people driving today still will be 10 years from now
7743046 another argument for not lifting the drilling ban pumping more oil will just feed our addiction to the fossil fuel that is burning up the planet we ought to be focusing on renewable energy wind solar geothermal people didnt give up their horse and buggy until henry ford began making affordable cars were anxiously awaiting our next transportation mode
7743047 we are making progress suvs are going the way of the dodo bird alternative fuel vehicles are becoming more and more prevalent heck even my mom uses reusable bags now but heres the half empty offshore drilling is not a solution its not even a quick fix its a mistake plain and simple the only thing it has to offer is false hope and more environmental damage
7743048 the clark rockefeller story is just too weird to ignore first a magnate then an alleged murderer now a messed up german exchange student thats quite a progression
7743049 all in all a creep but rockefeller must also have been cunning to get away with the identity shifts he did and to go so far as to start a family and accumulate enough cash to lay down a half mil in cashiers checks for a house theres just no way a normal person could do this morality or mere mix ups about ones own lies would get in the way at some point
7743050 all im saying much political ado about nothing dems get back to the political discourse

7743055 to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7743056 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7743057 see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7743058 we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7743059 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7743060 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7743061 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7743062 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7743063 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7743064 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7743065 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7743066 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7743067 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7743068 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7743069 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7743070 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7743071 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7743072 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7743073 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7743074 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7743075 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7743076 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7743077 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7743078 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7743079 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7743080 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7743081 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7743082 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7743083 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7743084 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7743085 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7743086 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7743096 ks oils has been rising for the last couple of months and its an uptrend so a stock that is trending up one tends to go long it has a resistance at rs 78 and major support area would be between rs 65 and rs 61 so unless and until the stock breaks below rs 65 and rs 61 even medium term traders may continue to remain long or buy on dips and above rs 78 one can add more if one is technically oriented i think above rs 78 the target would be rs 85 to rs 90
7743097 marksans pharma is showing a major buying intensity over the last three days if it were to cross rs 23 25 range then it would bring about a kind of an intermediate uptrend but it is little doubtful whether it will be able to cross rs 23 25 immediately and without much a do
7743098 sasken communication technologies has been consolidating and now if there is a breakout above rs 160 then one would say its an accumulation once it crosses rs 160 range it can move up even further this is one of those stocks that were showing signs that some accumulation is happening and the stock is showing bullish signs so above rs 160 the immediate target is rs 173 to rs 180 but if it sustains above rs 160 it can be bought even for the medium term expecting a minimum target of rs 200 210

7743115 college students of course are a little more than the average because theyre getting more than the average amount of education but theyre not radically different theyre not radically more politicized i think some people look back with nostalgia at the 1960s when the anti war demonstrators burned down rotc buildings and occupied the presidents office etc etc but even the 1960s as its remembered was a thing that happened only on some campuses not on all and number 2 was historically the exception it wasnt historically the rule
7743116 i always sort of lay down the law at the beginning of the semester that were not in this class to argue about who should be president but rather who we expect to win and why we expect that what sorts of issues are going to work well for different candidates in other words we focus a lot more on the science of elections

7743124 the fact that the line of democrat leadership from kennedy to carter to pelosi were paraded across the stage without the clintons said volumes about what the campaign wanted monday night
7743125 for a year and a half obamas name has been intertwined with clintons tonight the separation was clear and purposeful

7743139 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7743140 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7743141 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7743142 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7743149 it was just an unbelievable sports week in hawaii and im as proud as anybody could be
7743150 i thought to myself gosh hawaii is really a special place
7743151 im hoping that every parent takes a note that there is a special gift in their childs life
7743152 never never you get individual situations but this has been just awesome
7743153 you couldnt have written a better script i mean this is hollywood
7743154 this is not only going to benefit all of our sports programs but really the entire state the amount of exposure thats been coming to the state of hawaii is absolutely unprecedented
7743155 i think it helps the economy quite a lot it helps all of us who live because we feel better but it also helps because of the exposure our state has been getting throughout the olympics and now with this little league world series
7743156 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7743157 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7743158 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7743159 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7743161 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7743162 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7743163 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7743164 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7743165 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7743166 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7743167 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7743168 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7743169 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7743170 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7743171 who are open to doing something on the production side
7743172 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7743173 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7743174 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7743175 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7743192 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7743193 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7743194 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7743195 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7743196 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7743197 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7743198 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7743199 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7743200 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7743201 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7743202 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7743203 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7743204 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7743205 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7743206 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7743207 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7743232 to like something is to want to ingest it and in that sense is to submit to the world to like something is to succumb in a small but contentful way to death but dislike hardens the perimeter between the self and the world and brings a clarity to the object isolated in its light any dislike is in some measure a triumph of definition distinction and discrimination a triumph of life
7743233 the bottom line is i think they have a decision to make and from our standpoint were ready to move on

7743237 our business grew 66 million year on year but the two acquisitions accounted for less than 30 million of that so a good percentage of our growth was organic
7743238 if your underlying business isnt growing acquisitions can just leak away
7743239 there are a couple of commander assets that would fit our business but were conscious that acquisitions have to be the right fit
7743240 if we bought a whole business it could upset the apple cart commander had this difficulty when it brought volante

7743243 when my son was 3 months old i took him to the zoo
7743244 yet i see something very hopeful in kids the birth of new activists kids dont just feel helplessness and panic but a sense of injustice too i sometimes think the thing that keeps adults from acting is cynicism a belief that we cant really change things kids arent like that theyre awake to whats around them so they can actually do something about it we teach our kids all these ideals lets leave the earth a better place than we found it kids are motivated not just by whats in their heads but by what they actually see like a baby polar bear they can be the ones to motivate us their parents to change
7743245 kids learn manners from their parents why shouldnt they learn from them the beauty of asparagus im not one of those mothers who could ever have grown her own garden but if i had to do it all over again i would really celebrate the joys of carrots and broccoli and spinach i certainly would have felt better had i tried and of course my children would have too
7743246 my mom has always been conscious of the environment and health issues
7743247 it wasnt until later that i understood the harm that can come from pesticides and other chemicals in food
7743248 now we also do other things to protect our familys health from installing a water filtration system to using nontoxic shampoos i try to open the windows in the day an old fashioned airing out even in winter because the air inside the house is often more polluted than the air outside
7743249 i just want my kids to be as healthy as they possibly can and i feel like eating well is the best start for living well
7743250 some things are important for the world to know like how long i shower seriously i take a three minute shower i even brush wash brush my teeth while i shower heres why i learned that every two minutes in the shower uses as much water as a person in africa uses for everything in their life for a whole day drinking bathing cooking and cleaning everything when you become aware of all the things you do and the effect those things have you want to make small changes when i found out that my cell phone charger still uses energy when its plugged in and its not being used i began unplugging it it all goes back to awareness and knowing better and then making a simple shift in habit eventually it just becomes second nature if we all begin to learn from one another and share some of the things we do we just might be able to affect the world for the better through these little rituals

7743252 it is expected that the center of the depression will move near or over the southwest of haiti on tuesday
7743253 president bush came into office and declared he had a vision but in practice there was nothing visionary innovative or well thought out
7743254 and as a consequence we have been driving full speed ahead on neutral for a very long time
7743255 with the bush administration we have no sense of any legacy at all
7743256 its fashionable to say bush missed opportunities and was using the wrong paradigm but i disagree the dna of peacemaking is strong palestinian and israeli leadership and that we dont have
7743257 if bush had tried to do more in these circumstances he would have risked further deteriorating the prestige of his presidency
7743258 there is not enough time to do any work now none of the players are in any shape to formulate policy and no one has energy to work on this peace process
7743259 the only thing we can hope for now is to avoid a complete breakdown in dialogue and keep a small flame going for the next american administration
7743260 there is absolutely no hope for progress on the peace process at this junction
7743261 the idea that this is going to strengthen abu mazen in any substantial way is a big mistake
7743262 there will be celebrations yes but the day after nothing significant will remain and it will not move dialogue forward
7743263 people are realizing that economic independence is probably more important than political independence
7743264 nobody was realizing that before india can choke us anytime no matter what the situation is tomorrow the first they will do is stop the supply into kashmir
7743265 trade between srinagar and muzaffarabad is part of confidence building measures between india and pakistan that has time and again been talked about by mainstream political parties
7743266 unfortunately new delhi has not responded as a result the separatists have jumped on the same bandwagon that is when the fruit growers and everybody else said hang on if the rest of indias market is closed to us then we will start heading the other way
7743267 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7743268 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7743269 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7743270 we will not rest until all of the prisoners are released
7743271 the prisoners message is that they should not be forgotten
7743272 i will continue the struggle for our national goals the establishment of a palestinian state and the release of prisoners
7743273 releasing prisoners especially those involved in terrorist attacks is not simple
7743274 but we understand the importance of this to palestinian society and we hope to strengthen the moderate and pragmatic leadership
7743275 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7743276 there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but you know its always complicated out here
7743277 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there

7743289 the airline put pressure on mechanics for them to authorise planes to take off even if they were not ready
7743290 flights and planes are absolutely safe and respect all operational security standards
7743291 at spanair no pilot faces pressure to fly a plane that does not meet all the standards of operational security
7743292 i feel this is the beginning of the new era in parliament the era probably when the executive has to find ways of negotiating with the legislature in order to put through programs
7743293 obviously as a party we are fully aware that we find ourselves in a situation where we have somebody claiming to be head of state which we know very well did not win that head of state
7743294 we would like to play a bridging role between developing countries and developed countries
7743295 i think im gonna stay unmarried and just go for the babies im following in angelinas footsteps
7743296 we get such a kick out of seeing the work and effort that locals put in

7743303 now it seems as if the market is already feeling the chillof autumn
7743304 stocks are suffering around the world losing out to bondsand some commodities as investors shy away from equity risk

7743307 there will be people who leave this convention saying theywill vote for mccain and thats what the media is going tofocus on
7743308 but the majority is putting aside the personalitiesof this convention and well focus on winning the election
7743309 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporterswho were going to have to work hard to persuade to come onboard thats not surprising
7743310 merrill lynch told us they are willing to cooperate withus
7743311 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations

7743315 when you dont play as well as you know you can but you are still getting results then that is a sign of a good team
7743316 we have a big game on wednesday night and we have to respond with a top class performance because was we did today saturday was just not good enough
7743317 they are definitely the toughest opponents weve had in a champions league qualifier i know people expect us to get through but its not as if were playing a mickey mouse team
7743318 the belgian league has a lot of quality and their champions are used to getting into the group stages we had a tough match against anderlecht a few years ago so im not surprised liege caused us problems
7743319 they caught us a bit cold in the first leg but you have to remember that they had gone something like 30 games unbeaten in their own league and they are a club with european pedigree
7743320 we didnt play well and we know well have to improve at anfield everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7743321 its always a funny time for us to have such a massive game before weve got going in the season some of our results have reflected that
7743322 we lost at home to ak graz in the year we won the competition and had a narrow win in the last minute against maccabi haifa two years ago so anyone thinking well win comfortably knows thats very dangerous
7743323 i believe im at the top of my game right now and like any player i want to win things
7743324 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7743325 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognise these separatist regions
7743326 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7743327 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7743328 the g7 is united in support for georgias territorial integrity and alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognise abkhazia and south ossetia
7743329 that decision is not going to help things it only adds to the tension in the region
7743330 we will take any decision including up to a complete break in relations
7743331 there has been a dramatic worsening of our relations but we are not to blame
7743332 if there is a suspension of military cooperation this is military cooperation
7743333 no one with common sense can expect to co operate with russia in one part of the world while acting against it in another
7743334 every australian is proud of you every man woman and child in this nation is proud of each and every one of you
7743335 for those of us who may be going to london start preparing
7743336 when it comes to sports funding its not either or either community sport or elite sport well be doing both
7743337 the kids who are engaging in community sport a lot of them want to have the hope in their eyes that they can rise to elite representational levels as well
7743338 the government is funding a large slab of investment in community level sport school sports indigenous sports but also were not going to be back tracking when it comes to funding for olympic level sports either
7743339 we want to have another look at it because its a positive constructive idea lets see if it works
7743340 im just looking forward to seeing my mum and having a holiday
7743341 when you win in three sets it is a good results
7743342 i had some difficult moments in the match so that is going to help me be prepared for the pressure moments later on
7743343 i tried to keep my level up i tried to hurry him
7743344 he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7743345 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7743346 in the first set i felt like i was playing against a wall
7743347 in the second set i told myself to just play your game and dont give up
7743348 it is tough to play opponent who doesnt have anything to lose
7743349 i didnt know she was 16 until they made the announcement before the match i did as much as i needed to win the match
7743350 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands
7743351 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7743352 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change
7743353 i just wanted to make the statement that i have and always will be proud of my country
7743354 what i was clearly talking about was that im proud in how americans are engaging in the political process

7743369 our study found that pregnant women were more likely to aim for a vaginal delivery and they accept a higher threshold of risks from vaginal delivery when compared with clinicians
7743370 this indicates that experiencing labour and attempting a normal birth are two very important priorities in womens decision making
7743371 it may also indicate that doctors are biased by their inevitable involvement in complex cases or labours where things have gone wrong
7743372 if theyve seen a traumatic birth or been involved in a tragedy there is no debriefing for them
7743373 it can mean they are more judgemental about the risks involved
7743374 the numbers are relatively small but the important thing is that these deaths are preventable
7743375 every year a number of patients die in the bath so convincing people to take showers would be life saving

7743380 my eyes are seeing x but whats really going on
7743381 this study shows a consistent 20 increase in the risk of diabetes
7743382 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7743383 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause
7743384 however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown
7743385 the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life

7743405 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7743406 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7743409 there was a commitment in early 2007 that elections in fiji will take place in march 2009 and there is every reason that the country should work towards that date he said
7743410 as it is in the best interest of our distinct and diverse communities that elections are held as it marks the commencement of democratic processes whereby the will of the people will determine our future as a nation
7743411 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7743412 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7743413 just like me barack obama lost his mother to cancer too young
7743414 i understand that the mccain campaign is running ads trying to divide us and let me state what i think about their tactics and these ads im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message

7743416 were not the fall in line party were diverse many voices but make no mistake we are united

7743422 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7743423 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7743424 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7743427 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7743428 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year
7743429 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured
7743430 if they break any law they will be dealt with accordingly
7743431 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7743432 i think police are still able to control the situation so there is no need to send the soldiers out to stop the protesters
7743433 they were quite interested in my research and passed it around internally to a few select people
7743434 they may end up introducing some of the protection mechanisms i have suggested in my research

7743596 the green party is claiming they have made the scheme even tougher than it was previously which should ring alarm bells for the public

7743667 at work for whatever reason weve applied more management tools than we have at home which doesnt make sense because a family is an organization
7743668 weve never recognized the incredible cost of winging it which is what we do

7743700 i am a jumping jack always looking for an opportunity to expand my design vision
7743701 fashion was just another medium to express my creativity the plan was to design a space where young entrepreneurial individuals could shop for clothes and accessories with an asian aesthetic sensibility
7743702 i shortlisted 80 designers out of which 20 agreed eventually just eight fit the bill
7743703 the space was decorated in white with all 2 500 guests wearing white ensembles carrying white binoculars and hand fans it was spectacular
7743704 for a buyer shopping at my boutique should be a breeze you will find clothes that are flattering easy to wear and bear a print of heritage
7743705 if someone asks me where they can buy an indian ensemble i wouldnt know where to direct them
7743706 her price point is the major draw not everyone wants to spend a lakh on a wedding outfit considering that indian weddings have multiple functions like the sangeet haldi ceremony and reception
7743707 no matter whether it is sandalwood or bollywood music is the same everywhere for me music is not about composing after conducting a survey of what will work and what wont for me i believe in composing from the soul that music will touch hearts kannada films are not new to me i have been in touch with musicians like gurukiran manomurthy and harikrishna for a while it was during this point of time that jothegara happened with ram prasad as the producer
7743708 my first film was ghulam where music composers jatin lalit gave me the chance to sing the song tujkho kya however it was the aamir khan song aati kya khandala that became a bigger hit
7743709 the first film i composed for was hum dum directed by kushan nandy the film did pretty well and the audio was a commercial success now its my turn to give my best to the kannada film im working for it has always been my dream to be part of this industry and i hope to be successful
7743710 in my opinion there was a big gap between traditional project management software and e mail e mail is the most widely used software for project management right now most of the projects are not managed in microsoft project most of the projects right now are managed in e mail and microsoft excel it is a huge inefficiency when the project manager has to copy information from one tool to another back and forth when he sends an e mail or when he receives an email he has to update the plan when he updates the plan he has to communicate that back to the members of the team and upper management he has to send e mails again thats a lot of e mails as you know the number of e mails that you send and receive can become a problem in some cases i saw this not as a problem but rather as an opportunity to make people more productive and to cut unnecessary costs right from the start i envisioned that our project management tool should be as much integrated with e mail as possible with this in mind we came up with the idea of how people can create tasks via e mail we have applied for a patent for this idea
7743711 there are different aspects to e mail integration one if you send an e mail to somebody lets say your assistant or your employee with a task in that e mail you put wrike com in the cc field wrike will catch that e mail it will parse it it will create a task it will share this task between you and the recipients and it will assign this task to the employee to whom you sent this e mail if you put a due date in the subject line wrike will keep track of it and if the person misses a due date the system will send a reminder to him or her instead of you two if you tag the e mail wrike will put it into the right part your hierarchy like plan or to do list this saves you a lot of time later the feature we are working on right now we will catch the discussions if you start to have a discussion about that task we will keep track of it and store it along with the task in our web based system you can always check out the discussions if you want to plug a new person into this lets say you want to pass this task to quality assurance they will see a full trail of discussions behind the task thats an interesting part of the e mail integration three you will receive notifications when something is changed there are different settings so you may subscribe to what you need you will be updated about what is going on with the project what people are changing for example if somebody is rescheduling his task youll get an update if you think that this jeopardizes some deadline you can follow up on that last but not least we designed our e mail integration so it requires no installation you can easily run it from blackberry devices you can run it from gmail you can run it from outlook you dont need to install or download anything email integration is a big commitment from us and we want to make it as good as possible so we are working right now on a native outlook to introduce some more advanced features for people who are using microsoft outlook we are spending a lot of time tuning things up and making the e mail integration part better and better
7743712 what are t emerging structures in project management speaking with andrew filev
7743713 david and victoria beckham were driving a car that had been scratched the day before when it had been left parked at the airport they were not involved in any accident at all there was no police no crash no paparazzi chase etc just very incorrect reports via internet gossip sites
7743714 maybe my question now is how can a married man be offended by rude disrespectful behavior from the woman not his wife hes trying to seduce when hes been keeping his marital status a secret
7743715 i think most white politicians do not understand that the race pride we all have trumps everything else
7743716 every effort to enact immigration legislation must expect to meet a number of hostile forces and in particular two hostile forces of considerable strength one of these is composed of corporation employers who desire to employ physical strength broad backs at the lowest possible wage and who prefer a rapidly revolving labor supply at low wages to a regular supply of american wage earners at fair wages the other is composed of racial groups in the united states who oppose all restrictive legislation because they want the doors left open for an influx of their countrymen regardless of the menace to the people of their adopted country
7743717 hey we need to fit the words gift shop in here somewhere
7743718 ok well just start pushing the letters up to make room
7743719 the princess of acadia ferry crosses from saint john to digby in about 3 hours and reduces the trip to this end of nova scotia by quite a few hours and substantial reduction in carbon footprint

7743802 as a global services provider wipro will increasingly see business in geographies like india west asia and australia in soa consulting enterprise soa enabled packaged applications and development of new applications in the soa space in the next two to four years
7743803 soa adoption has gone from the hype part of the technology curve to the mainstream adoption part and a lot of money is being spent on both infrastructure and tools as well as in building the soa services and processes however most of this adoption still seems to be in the localised scenario of specific business flows or visibility requirements this would require a serious change in the mindset of developers and it operation teams across the whole enterprise

7743910 providing greater opportunities for cycling through the creation of more bike lanes and the provision of cycling infrastructure means more people will choose to ride their bike to work or study in the city
7743911 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7743912 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7743913 that was immature and irresponsible on your part but i accept that you were not acting as a predator
7743914 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
7743915 class of 2021 thats nuts 2021 i think well focus on 2008 noah is gonna be busy and zach starts tue thur pre k next week

7743918 de spekulerar i en b rsv ndning som i alla fall inte jag har sett de kommer att tvingas s nka terb ringsr ntan och kanske till och med g ra tertag av utlovade medel vi siktar p att uppr tth lla en positiv terb ringsr nta genom en f rsiktig och tryggare strategi
7743919 det viktiga r att vi har tillg ngar som t cker bankens l ngsiktiga pensions taganden
7743920 pensionsstiftelsen har ven efter nedg ngen betydande verv rden med tillg ngar som vida verskrider pensionsskulden
7743921 vi har en tonvikt p ett f tal aktier och det r inget vi verv ger att ndra p p grund av kortsiktiga reaktioner p b rsen

7743931 we knew as we started redesigning the teaching and learning curriculum in the district that it would take three to five years working the plan before we could expect significant improvement
7743932 we consider this year to be the base year for changes that are being put in place
7743933 im very pleased that all of our 10th grade assessments improved in math social studies and in science
7743934 we are one of 16 school districts in the state to have a development grant which is being used to re evaluate the kindergarten through 12th grade curriculum and our delivery of instruction
7743935 we looked at the data from the past report cards and placed our resources in those areas with the greatest needs the value added measurement shows what gains districts earn gaining from year to year
7743936 at the beginning of the year we set our academic goals spelled them out and wrote them down sheets said we place our resources on those issues that needed the most attention we focused on the needs of our subgroups
7743937 you win with people and i would put my professional staff against any in the state
7743938 we have some very innovative programs including the response to intervention which monitors what students are doing in every grade level
7743939 the state report cards measure the minimum competency in specific areas
7743940 they are a snapshot they do not define a district
7743941 we are continuously looking at the individual learning styles of our students
7743942 we did a lot of curriculum mapping having instructors who are teaching the same subjects across several grades talk about what they are doing each grade knows what the next expect their students to know when they enter their classrooms
7743943 we cant go backward we have to get better every year
7743944 our high school and our elementary school achieved excellent ratings last year
7743945 we still have room for improvement but this is a result of a lot of hard work on the part of our staff
7743946 weve done a good job in using data to determine our needs
7743947 we have comprehensive programs to help our students needing help in the classrooms and in after school programs
7743948 it takes a lot of work for member of my staff to maintain what we have done these tests are making us accountable he said
7743949 valued added scores are designed to show how schools and districts have improved over time
7743950 it was tougher for schools to make the ayp standards this year than last year
7743951 our students are on trajectory to make proficiency by 2012
7743952 these problems going into year end are likely to be worse this time round because of the amount banks have to refinance in december
7743953 the suspicion is that banks are still hiding losses the banking system relies on trust and at the minute there quite simply isnt any
7743954 that would be an international marriage would you get married just after one or two blind dates
7743955 an important part of what im about what makes me tick
7743956 shes on the phone with the world food program hes on the phone with saakashvili
7743957 its like this great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7743958 georgia back in the third century the king of georgia converted to christianity you see churches there that date back to the fourth and fifth century
7743959 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now
7743960 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7743961 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7743962 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7743963 their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7743964 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7743965 who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling
7743966 we will not rest until all of the prisoners are released
7743967 the prisoners message is that they should not be forgotten
7743968 i will continue the struggle for our national goals the establishment of a palestinian state and the release of prisoners
7743969 releasing prisoners especially those involved in terrorist attacks is not simple
7743970 but we understand the importance of this to palestinian society and we hope to strengthen the moderate and pragmatic leadership
7743971 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7743972 there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but you know its always complicated out here
7743973 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7743974 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7743975 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7743976 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7743977 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7743978 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7743979 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home
7743980 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients
7743981 it wont damage the building or contents but it will make it uncomfortable
7743982 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7743983 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7743984 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7743985 she hasnt talked to anyone she just looks like your sweet little grandma and no one knows where she is
7743986 there has no doubt been an upheaval in film during the 1960s but almost nothing has been said about the department store styling or modistes sensibility which seems to be causing the upheaval
7743987 every inch of the screen and film as a potential area for prizeworthy creativity
7743988 nothing in its path other than the signs of eager industrious unkempt activity
7743989 i knew i was hip at any point in my life
7743990 when did movie directors decide that boredom was part of the game
7743991 theres so much lust for naturalism that its puzzling how he keeps being seduced into a soupy pretentious symbolism
7743992 i think its sinful to give the audience material it knows already whether the material is about race relations or the car culture or the depiction and placement of a candy bar
7743993 great ill go back and ride on my throne again
7743994 i dont think this segregation idea was done to help the smaller theatres im sure it was done because some of the larger theatres were sick of being beat by the smaller theatres
7743995 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7743996 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7743997 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7743998 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7743999 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7744000 i never dreamed i would walk again after i was wounded i forgot what its like
7744001 only when standing up can i feel how tall i really am and speak to people eye to eye not from below
7744002 it raises people out of their wheelchair and lets them stand up straight
7744003 physically the body works differently when upright you can challenge different muscles and allow full expansion of the lungs
7744004 psychologically it lets people live at the upright level and make eye contact
7744005 it may be a burdensome device but it will be very helpful and important for those who choose to use it
7744006 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7744007 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7744008 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7744009 i looked across the table and there was joey maybe 5 10 5 9
7744010 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7744011 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it

7744015 i will be there next january on the floor of the u s senate when we begin
7744016 there is a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass through we will reach our destination
7744017 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope lives on and the dream lives on
7744018 reminds us as a party and as americans what our core values are

7744022 commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7744023 moral obligation to do everything possible to make this world a better place
7744024 as he built up to a climax the crowd roared and took him and accepted him with all its heart
7744025 people were shouting and hollering that one will always stick out for me
7744026 he is one of the veterans of the civil rights movement and the progressive era and obama is the rookie who is picking it up and carrying it into the 21st century there is so much history in this
7744027 the united states will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and to support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7744028 they are clearly trying to empty southern ossetia from georgians which i dont think goes by any of the books that we deal with in international relations
7744029 we are thrilled to partner with the mets and the city of new york on this stadium seat project
7744030 mets fans have a unique opportunity to own a piece of history and s amp s seating is honored to provide our expertise to ensure each seat pair is professionally removed and shipped

7744033 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7744034 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7744035 the reason the state fair of virginia was so interested in him is because he is the spitting image of his great grandfather
7744036 hes got so much personality hes a licker and he loves to kiss
7744037 but i think these other young men were concerned that they would be identified and they were telling him you got to do it
7744038 simply means the matter will now likely go to trial
7744039 really the bottom line is that r j reynolds continues to believe that we didnt infringe the patents
7744040 the patents in question are invalid and if and when the matter goes to trial we are confident we will prevail
7744041 our company really believes that we ultimately will be successful
7744042 all through the district state region and now here at the world series we were able to come back and play as a team with purpose
7744043 i think we had a great group of team leadership
7744044 were all friends outside of this so it was a great experience being in hotels together for the last few weeks
7744045 when we choose the team there are the 11 or 12 players that we know will be there then we try to think for the future
7744046 the high schools how do you help them you want to help their kids get work for the next season
7744047 we cannot keep these people if we dont pay them
7744048 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world

7744052 i am a mistreated parasite suffering a subtle disease a stray bullet shot into the crowded air but a misplaced reaction of a thermo nuclear fusion the narcotic victim of lyrical dependency
7744053 they whisper our destiny the wind and the air disclose our futility nightly serenading our deceit to the skies and to the seas
7744054 all through the district state region and now here at the world series we were able to come back and play as a team with purpose
7744055 i think we had a great group of team leadership
7744056 were all friends outside of this so it was a great experience being in hotels together for the last few weeks
7744057 in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends

7744068 cuando un inversionista llega al pa s pide seguridad garant as de que lo que se apruebe hoy ma ana no lo cambien porque muchas veces se presenta un proyecto te dicen que s y se comienza a desarrollar pero luego llega a otra instancia y te lo frenan pero resulta que ya hay toda una inversi n hecha
7744069 aqu se requieren permisos municipales no objeci n de turismo permisos medioambientales y dem s por eso entendemos que lo mejor ser a tener una ventanilla nica que permita que ese proceso se acelere porque es m s conveniente para el inversionista que no tendr que estar dando brincos de un sitio a otro
7744070 extraordinaria labor de promoci n y b squeda de inversi n que se hace desde el gobierno pero entiende que lo importante es que una vez llegue el inversionista tenga la mayor facilidad posible dentro del marco regulatorio
7744071 el dinero que se pierde por los retrasos es incalculable cada transacci n inmobiliaria es millonaria y mientras m s tiempo se dure m s dinero se pierde pues se impactan m ltiples agentes econ micos un d a de retraso significa miles de pesos

7744074 there is a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass through we will reach our destination
7744075 the hope shall rise again and the dream lives on
7744076 no hacemos nada ni el gobierno ni el ayuntamiento de intervenir en la colocaci n de aceras contenes y asfaltado de las calles si no se resuelve primero el problema de la ca ada y eso requiere una inversi n muy significativa que supera los 80 millones de pesos
7744077 con los moradores de la javilla el manguito y la barquita hay un compromiso que no s lo abarca al s ndico y al ayuntamiento sino al presidente de la rep blica y al secretario de obras p blicas
7744078 phenomenal she nailed it im sure barack is very proud
7744079 she seemed down to earth warm and kind good story too
7744080 very moving very human made me cry a couple of times but the kids at the end almost stole the show
7744081 i thought it was wonderful i was especially blown away by the end when she talked about barack and the girls
7744082 peoples perceptions are that when they rent larger vehicles the cost of filling up with gas is going to be a lot higher
7744083 they would have a few little cars and a huge field of beautiful suvs next to them
7744084 car rental people have not seen such an abrupt change in demand at the counter ever before
7744085 people used to be very happy when they were upgraded

7744088 the access to this website is prevented by court order
7744089 aq is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern domestically or overseas but countering the aq threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires aq centric communications efforts
7744090 it the narrative combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events
7744091 the objective is not to dismiss grievances but undermine aqs position as their champion and violent extremism as the solution
7744092 our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme aq is losing support
7744093 this series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the aq narrative but it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard hitting campaign using private sector resources
7744094 we are in negotiations with several major communications companies to design and deliver high impact campaigns across media and non media channels
7744095 push these message themes to a wide range of contacts
7744096 if it looks too much like government propaganda then i dont think people are going to listen nor should they
7744097 on balance and given the very significant changes that we have achieved we have decided it is better to make a start than to do nothing and so we have told the government this morning we will vote for a scheme that proceeds on the basis of what we have negotiated so far
7744098 we have won 1 billion to insulate and upgrade new zealand homes to make them warm and dry and to keep peoples power bills at a level they can afford

7744101 in terms of the front end journalist area there might be some but main thrust is in the sub editing

7744520 in minnesota we have 200 to 300 commercial beekeepers who make their living primarily from the production of honey though some of them also move their bees around the country for pollination theyre the ones who have seen the biggest decline in numbers in recent years
7744521 the rest of us are hobby beekeepers about 700 to 800 and the hobby operations arent as badly affected
7744522 many have lost a hive or two but nothing to the extent of what some commercial producers have lost

7744542 if my life can be a ray of hope for those struggling through marriage then ill put it out there im happily married and loving it
7744543 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7744544 you see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future he knows that that thread is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7744545 we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7744546 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7744547 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7744548 there is a new wave of change all around us
7744549 and if we set our compass true we will reach our destination not merely victory for our party but renewal for our nation and this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7744550 so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause
7744551 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7744552 john mccain has spent more than 25 years in washington voting against womens freedom
7744553 and has pledged to appoint justices to the supreme court who will overturn roe v wade
7744554 know that this son of a single mom will stand up for the dreams of our daughters and i know that john mccain wont
7744555 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
7744556 i think its a shame that you are not hiring an outside investment banker to put the company up for sale
7744557 ive heard the exact same set of promises for years and years and years and we seem to get no closer
7744558 i just dont understand how hiring an investment bank is not the next step
7744559 whether the company should hire an investment banker is yet to be determined
7744560 the selections are made by our board and various committee members and they certainly had a lot of people to look at
7744561 their efforts are already having an impact on our downtown and their current plans show additional accomplishments in the months and years to come
7744562 but also broadway itself its as if she is poised to transform broadway single handedly
7744563 whether the original billy wilsons on franklin street or the new billy wilsons on broadway he has been a fixture on the norwich scene
7744564 he has supported numerous organizations and events usually behind the scene without looking for credit
7744565 they have seen many changes in downtown over the years
7744566 and for better or for worse they unflaggingly continued on and worked to serve those whose careers centered around downtown
7744567 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7744568 first youre happy youre all safe then you realize you dont have any pictures anymore
7744569 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7744570 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7744571 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7744572 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7744573 their comments build upon a cynical view of the law the courts and lawyers their views and opinions showed a total disregard and disrespect for the basic principles of what our criminal courts are all about
7744574 the basic principles of what our criminal courts are all about
7744575 because it would give them their 15 minutes of fame
7744576 since the defense closed yesterday by advancing this theory many people have expressed to me how
7744577 hook up 4 pin 5v 12v power plug from the system power supply if your card has an auxillary power connector
7744578 the sky is falling please post here if u agree
7744579 run 4 teh hills guyz teh sky it is ah fallin on our hedz oh noes
7744580 the dark gods march in step and i shall deliver them this world for their pleasure
7744581 then i am glad once again that you are on my side
7744582 we hired cu law school to identify specific authority for executive action
7744583 now were putting together a list of options directly tied to the specific authority that the president has
7744584 there was a clause in our previous contracts that assured us that master developers will guarantee residence visa the clause has now been removed
7744585 we do not assure property buyers residence visas for freehold property buyers across dubai the grant of residence visas is subject to the rules requirements and procedures of the department of naturalisation and residency not the developer
7744586 upon the purchase of a nakheel property we will provide customers the basis for sponsorship although the grant of a residence visa is still subject to the rules requirements and procedures of the department of naturalisation and residency
7744587 never assured any visa and was just acting as a facilitator
7744588 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7744589 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7744590 its based on what we are charged at the tesoro refinery
7744591 when i get a phone call i change the sign im not sure i want to know how it works i dont know who makes all the money off gasoline
7744592 good deal of the cuts are in the newspaper production area we can be more productive and itll have absolutely no impact on quality
7744593 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7744594 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7744595 you cant have those sort of cuts and keep providing the same sorts of service to your community
7744596 a significant number will come out of editorial i think they say therell be about 120 jobs lost out of editorial
7744597 from what we see of their statements so far most of those will come out of the age and the sydney morning herald
7744598 to think you can do that without undermining the quality of those papers i think defies belief
7744599 there was no report of casualty or damages at lampung
7744600 i try to cut out all the parts youd skip
7744601 manifestar su apoyo al proceso pol tico que vive bolivia y a la gesti n del presidente evo morales
7744602 estuvieron presentes el frente farabundo mart de liberaci n nacional fmln de el salvador el frente sandinista de nicaragua el polo democr tico alternativo de colombia y el frente amplio de uruguay
7744603 en la campa a del referendo revocatorio en el cual estuvo en juego el mandato de evo morales su aliado estrat gico hugo ch vez fue la espada y el presidente brasilero lula da silva el escudo
7744604 i saw one house maybe two that were completely in flames
7744605 i thought it was all dust at first but it started picking up and then i could start seeing the flames
7744606 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7744607 first youre happy youre all safe then you realize you dont have any pictures any more
7744608 i was doing a two day swing through eastern washington heard about the lentil festival had never been here
7744609 i thought wouldnt it be fun to see the community come around to the festival at the exact same time that parents are dropping off their students to wsu
7744610 i cant reform our health care system in one term weve made huge strides in economic development we are number three in the country now and weve made very good progress on things like community safety and quality of life and leading literally in alternative fuels and global climate change
7744611 i take nothing for granted weve got a long way to go but weve got momentum going toward the general and with barak obama i am sure he is going to bring out a whole lot of new voters voters that i know are going to ask for change in america like the change weve made happen in washington state i think it is really positive coming out of the primary and onto the general
7744612 as usually i worry a little bit about that gas then my maintenance codes
7744613 if you look almost all the way to the bottom you will see maintenance equipment and maintenance building are at 95 and 100 percent so those are the two that worry me because obviously we cant make a concerted effort to not spend it if something breaks then i need to fix it i have to fix it
7744614 the girders underneath are rusted away so we declared an emergency
7744615 we have a detour around the structure at this point
7744616 what a thoroughly stupid and naieve little girl she is
7744617 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
7744618 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7744619 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7744620 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7744621 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7744622 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7744623 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7744624 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7744625 warum holt man mich immer dahin wo noch nicht fertig ist
7744626 ich war neulich mal in rom hab mir auch mal die sixtinische kapelle angeschaut sch ne musik haben die gemacht
7744627 con los juegos ol mpicos el mundo ha conocido m s a china y china m s al mundo han sido unos juegos realmente excepcionales
7744628 been better than the other two alex smith and shaun hill and there hasnt really been much of a gray area his plays been better at the position than what weve had at any point in the last three years
7744629 whenever they give me the ball im going to take it
7744630 the guys behind me played very good if i can save the bullpen for a night that makes it even better
7744631 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7744632 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7744633 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7744634 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7744635 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7744636 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7744637 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7744638 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7744639 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can
7744640 that will contribute to how successful my season is going to be if i play all 16 games as the starter its not about yards catches touchdowns or averages just 16 games if i dont play 16 games who cares
7744641 i was tired after three or four plays coming back to the huddle asking for a breather that wasnt me i just didnt train hard enough
7744642 thats the key building block when a guy is in condition sharpens his skills gets in sync with the quarterback the results are what they are hes better positioned to take advantage of opportunities
7744643 thats why i wasnt interested in doing it last year but i grew up in virginia in an era when washington redskins hall of famer darrell green was a part time punt returner who showed up big in big games when you have skills that can help the team win you let guys do what they do
7744644 being away from it last year that kind of took away from my game
7744645 it kept me from getting my hands on the ball
7744646 the biggest question is whos no 1 whos no 2 i dont worry about it
7744647 they can put santonio no 1 but we dont sit there on the board and say this is no 1 this is no 2 coverage dictates where the ball goes
7744648 this is the year he can make his name if the media wants to give him all the attention fine you know what youre going to get from no 86 so it doesnt bother me that im the guy talked about the least
7744649 usually in your third year a light bulb comes on
7744650 all the talents there he has potential out of this world
7744651 that wasnt my choice but you still take all the flak from it
7744652 after awhile youve gotta do what you gotta do and do the best at where youre at
7744653 in such stories they never say a name just sources
7744654 do they seem like they dont like me if i was an outcast and a bad guy why would i still be around
7744655 did you hear anything after that where was the big ripple from lotts comments he said his sources said ive never seen the man in the locker room
7744656 so ive had success with every running back that ive had gores big year was more of a high point because were good friends hes like a little brother to me
7744657 im going to still roll as long as im on the field
7744658 because still i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7744659 there was a considerable amount of damage just about every wall and window was spray painted
7744660 it looked like world war iii broke out it was a mess
7744661 were doing a lot of positive things at the school and something like this puts us on our heels
7744662 were trying to change the whole culture of the school
7744663 their continued support of this program shows they are committed to taking action against those in our community who fail to dispose of their litter appropriately
7744664 we dont get into ranking suburbs against suburbs because there are a number of things that come into play
7744665 smaller rural areas wont have the same traffic density or population base as wyndham
7744666 these statistics do not indicate how littered an area is rather they relate to traffic numbers and peoples willingness to report litterers
7744667 litter is the most visible sign of pollution and the epa wants to tackle it as part of a state wide team
7744668 brett carroll was a hard working decent australian he lost his life in a workplace accident that should never have happened
7744669 on behalf of the community i denounce paper australias offending
7744670 given its history i consider paper australia has only reasonable prospects of rehabilitation
7744671 brett was ecstatic about having a daughter and called her his finest achievement and me a perfect mother
7744672 i didnt go out but my mum panicked and she went to the door and saw a man sitting on the footpath by a dark car
7744673 was tall and wearing a dark jacket and when he saw the light he got up and started asking for help
7744674 no university can remain excellent without constantly changing to keep up and pursue that
7744675 there is nothing i like better than the fall when it starts and commencement i like everything in between but nothing is more enjoyable
7744676 i spent a good deal of time with the fundraisers about how i can best advance the fundraising agenda for the institution
7744677 its sort of how i can be the new guy on the team and play the best position i can play
7744678 its mostly doing it thats how you get into it
7744679 hes not a newcomer hes been in the business a long time hes a quick learner
7744680 he is very skilled at pulling together information data that will demonstrate not only need but what the benefit cost ratio is
7744681 the university has been making very good progress these recent years and we need to sustain that
7744682 that requires to some extent not just money but also leadership skills and hell do a good job of it
7744683 can lsu be not just a powerhouse in louisiana not just a powerhouse in the sec not just a powerhouse in the u s but an international powerhouse in academics
7744684 how do we retain accessibility and still build programs of high enough quality so that when you leave here you know youve gotten a first rate education not just an inexpensive one
7744685 give them exactly what they deserve the very best education they possibly can
7744686 my hope is that students will understand that at a great university everyone has a title and a role but at the end of the day and at the bottom of all this were all colleagues
7744687 youre going to find someone who is not only engaged in the life of the campus but who has a clear sense of what it takes to take a campus of this kind of high quality of faculty and students and move it into the mainstream of american public higher education
7744688 when you see me walking across the campus and you have something on your mind stop and tell me whats up
7744689 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

7744693 if you get overrun it only works to a certain extent
7744694 theyre only good if the flames arent directly hitting you
7744695 there does seem to be a bit more support for the third party option among minnesotans who are not enthusiastic about the upcoming presidential race
7744696 and that suggests that there is a fatigue that may have set in regarding the democratic and republican options and some minnesotans are looking for an alternative
7744697 there does seem to be enough support for those third party candidates and the openness of minnesotans to consider voting for them that they could could draw in the 3 to 5 percent range which could well be enough to tilt the presidential race or the senate race in one direction or another
7744698 its hard to say exactly how that might play out as we move toward november
7744699 we just need more choice more choices are often better i do not necessarily feel strongly about any of these independent candidates but i think that it should always be an option
7744700 were showing how we feel about issues as an american public
7744701 so even if you vote for a loser youre still not a wasted vote
7744702 it isnt a place to sit around and play cards or knit or just sit around

7744706 for the first six to eight months we had tons of work

7744708 if the business closes earlier than the 60 days and pays out the employees for all 60 days of benefits and wages due to the affected employees there is no violation of state law
7744709 it means everyone is going to be out of a job
7744710 im saddened because there are a lot of guys other than me with families to support
7744711 they are the main people who bring in the money to support their families theyre out of a job

7744731 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right

7744779 whilst we are disappointed with the lower earnings in 2008 compared to 2007 we characterise the 2008 performance as a tale of two halves and consider this result a factor of adverse short term events impacting the business over the first nine months of the year
7744780 offshore there was a change in conditions in indonesia and continuing start up losses in the us that also impacted our results all these events had a negative impact on our asset utilisation in the first six to nine months of the year but we finished very strongly

7744792 the two biggest reasons why are money in politics and media consolidation
7744793 m s firme protesta ante un hecho inaudito en toda la historia democr tica
7744794 todos los concejales tendr n derecho a asistir con voz y sin voto a las sesiones de los rganos complementarios del concello en los que la ley establece el derecho a la participaci n de todos los grupos pol ticos
7744795 es mentira que se negase la asistencia a la comisi n a alg n concejal
7744796 tiene por costumbre enviar a tres concejales a cada reuni n y a las comisiones solamente tienen que ir los portavoces
7744797 hay muchas compa as que sufren ataques para vender sus bases de datos on line pero el volumen y la calidad de la informaci n que ha sido robada en best western hace el caso particularmente poco com n
7744798 las bandas rusas que se especializan en este tipo de trabajos habr n estado explotando la informaci n desde el momento en que estuvo disponible el pasado jueves por la noche en las manos equivocadas hay suficiente informaci n para perpetrar una ola criminal muy importante
7744799 las compa as m s importantes recurren a anti virus para proteger sus infraestructuras pero el problema es que esta medida s lo detecta el 60 de las amenazas en las manos adecuadas los virus pueden vulnerar estos programas f cilmente como al parecer ha ocurrido en este caso
7744800 a matar a romper los cristales del local y a quemar la peluquer a
7744801 tuvimos la suerte de que el remanente positivo se ajust bastante a la deuda
7744802 nosotros lo que pedimos es que desde las administraciones se ponga freno a estas situaciones que a o tras a o se repiten
7744803 es una pena que a d a de hoy a n haya empresas que se dediquen a matar lo que es de todos
7744804 en algunas zonas tur sticas de espa a las ventas han ca do un 70
7744805 el carril llega hasta la calle del sol y se interrumpe porque s lo hay un carril por lo tanto no puede haber una v a para los autobuses y otra para los coches
7744806 todos los veh culos circular n conjuntamente y al llegar a la calle san juan se volver n a separar es decir los coches ir n por un carril y los autobuses por el otro
7744807 los camiones de carga y descarga tampoco pueden estacionar en la calle para hacer su trabajo
7744808 se trata de inutilizar un carril para un bus que pasa cada cuarto de hora si el ayuntamiento quiere eliminar la doble fila deber a aumentar las multas
7744809 en esta zona pasan muchos ni os que vienen del colegio y los buses van a circular demasiado r pido por el carril si los menores no tienen cuidado puede llegar a ser un caos
7744810 en esta calle solamente circulan dos l neas de bus no me parece l gico que instalen un carril para un autob s que pasa cada cuarto de hora
7744811 el bus ir m s r pido pero lo que no van a cambiar es la mentalidad de utilizar el transporte p blico
7744812 lo nico que cambiar es que los buses circular n mucho m s r pido porque tienen un carril s lo para ellos
7744813 primero deber an hacer que hubiese m s buses y que pasasen con m s frecuencia y despu s construir este tipo de carriles
7744814 todo lo que sea para mejorar el transporte me parece positivo
7744815 desde mi punto de vista todo lo que sea para mejorar el transporte es positivo el problema para aparcar es un problema que existir a igual aunque no hubiese carril bus habr calles en las que no se pueda construir pero donde se pueda me parece bien
7744816 hay muchas quejas porque los clientes no tienen d nde aparcar
7744817 no me parece bien y menos en esta calle aqu no hay sitio para el carril bus y adem s se han cargado muchos aparcamientos hay quejas de todos los clientes y comerciantes porque no tienen d nde aparcar el que quiere ir a la farmacia no puede ir
7744818 el bus tendr mucho sitio para circular pero los coches no
7744819 creo que no es una buena medida porque quitaron muchas plazas de aparcamiento el bus tendr mucho sitio pero los coches no en federico tapia adem s s lo pasan dos l neas de bus si hubiese m s tr nsito me parecer a m s l gico
7744820 creo que no es muy til sobre todo por la estructura de la ciudad en madrid o en barcelona hay mucho m s tr fico y hay cuatro carriles pero aqu cuando haya mucha circulaci n los coches s lo tendr n una v a para circular
7744821 el ayuntamiento deber a mejorar la frecuencia de los buses
7744822 garantizar la seguridad de los residentes en las zonas afectadas
7744823 la indefensi n de los vecinos y de la propia administraci n local
7744824 al eliminar dos zonas elevadas que serv an como protecci n natural

7744832 la gente se queda impactada con el ojo del culo
7744833 uno de los libros m s curiosos que tenemos y que m s llama la atenci n a la gente es el ojo del culo creo que la gente se queda bastante impactada por el t tulo y lo compra pero tenemos de todo para todas las edades tebeos libros de arte f sica y qu mica

7744837 destacar a la novelita a mi a muller de wenceslao fern ndez fl rez publicada en 1924 este es un facs mil pero es una obra poco conocida y que la gente compra muy bien el principito es otro de los que m s se vende todos los a os pero aqu la gente pregunta mucho por obras de tema local relacionadas con galicia y sobre todo con a coru a
7744838 los libros que salen mejor son los de tres euros
7744839 el libro m s extra o que tengo es regla de la compa a de jes s es el original y est datado de 1690 aunque se vende un poco de todo es muy dif cil sacar este tipo de libros y claro salen mucho mejor los de tres euros como tengo todo tipo de libros hay quien viene en busca de algo en particular y quien s lo rebusca para ver lo que encuentra
7744840 es m s dif cil conseguir un libro antiguo que venderlo
7744841 los libros antiguos se compran en subastas a particulares y muchos en el extranjero parece mentira pero es mucho m s dif cil comprar un libro antiguo y de calidad para venderlo que encontrar despu s alguien que te lo quiera comprar los buenos libros siempre encuentran compradores pero es muy dif cil que la gente quiera deshacerse de ellos
7744842 la obra m s rara es de 1649 son 52 grabados de la capilla sixtina que le compr directamente a un coleccionista de una casa particular pero por lo que m s pregunta la gente es por novelas y mucho por los antiguos libros de cuando iban al colegio todos los a os traigo la enciclopedia lvarez que se vende muy bien aunque esta vez no la tengo
7744843 tengo un ejemplar de una obra de los 2 000 que editaron
7744844 el templo de salom n es una obra incre ble sta es una edici n de s lo 2 000 ejemplares y se trata de un comentario a la profec a de ezequiel y una investigaci n que hicieron los jesuitas sobre todos los templos del mundo que en su base llevan las medidas del templo de salom n en el volumen incluso vienen los planos de todas las iglesias que investigaron
7744845 para m uno de los libros m s curiosos que tengo es el mundo cient fico de 1915

7744850 my new buttman movie is a collection of scenes i shot in brazil with my new high def camera
7744851 it is a beautiful picture i was amazed at how good the girls i used were at sex i used two girls i had seen in jazz duros movies from brazil and another new girl they were beautiful and did very hard sex
7744852 im a tech geek and im a huge fan of porn with really hot sex
7744853 this brings together two things i love i still remember the day i saw a buttman movie for the first time it was ruby in buttmans bend over babes 4 that scene with her christi lake and rocco raised the standard of porn that i watched after that imagining that scene shot in hd and released on blu ray makes me marvel at how much better it could have been im thrilled that john is releasing this new brazilian movie on blu ray sun kissed blonde covergirl talita is flawless and i got goosebumps looking at the tiny blonde peach fuzz hairs on bellas round butt cheeks on a hdtv

7744856 with the new a series cameras users dont have to sacrifice cutting edge technology for innovative style or ease of use

7744858 phase in development in such a way so that when we talk about uptown and we talk about different places to live and play we create these distinct districts within uptown
7744859 then there was no reason to leave the campus and as a result the burnet avenue business district became distressed with new urbanism you have to create pedestrian friendly neighborhood business districts and there was nothing friendly along burnet avenue north of erkenbrecher
7744860 it would benefit more than just the institution but also benefit the community with new retail new housing so that those economics would become integrated
7744861 weaving and braiding are key elements in african american culture and are symbolic of how the community has come together to help revitalize avondale
7744862 our shared goal is to help make avondale in general and burnet avenue in particular a destination
7744863 its not piecemeal flipping a house here or there but this will be a bold change in the urban landscape the burnet project is more revolutionary than evolutionary
7744864 weve been the suburban developer known for these master planned communities but when we took that to uptown it holds true to creating a sense of place a sense of vibrancy and community and shows it can be done in an urban setting
7744865 its very nice aesthetically inside and outside and within walking distance of the hospitals
7744866 whether were talking short vine burnet avenue ludlow calhoun street we need a way that collectively it says that uptown is special but yet separately each district is able to provide a retail mix that continues to make them a striving sustainable business district

7744870 at the same time its important for the club as a whole and for the fans to honour ruben logan and wairangi who have all made such a big contribution to the warriors

7744908 lo estamos dejando muy claro igual o mayor importancia tiene el partido del jueves por lo que nos jugamos estando tan cerca de la fase de grupos de la uefa no queremos dejar escapar esta oportunidad
7744909 despu s de todo lo que sufrimos y de la remontada que hicimos el a o pasado nadie imaginaba que bamos a llegar a este punto
7744910 todos los que venimos de otro equipo de otro pa s so amos con jugar un d a la uefa la liga de campeones y poco a poco vamos cumpliendo objetivos todos sabemos la importancia de este tipo de torneos te dan madurez y te proyectan
7744911 escuch que hab a mucho pesimismo por el 0 0 pero nosotros lo vemos de una manera muy diferente sabemos que marcar fuera de casa cuenta mucho y nosotros no jugamos mal de visitante por lo general a domicilio hacemos gol y eso nos da la ilusi n de que podemos avanzar ellos van a estar m s presionados ahora que juegan en casa y nosotros no tenemos nada que perder ojal haya m s espacios habr que aprovecharlos
7744912 ganar a un rival as siempre tiene mucha m s repercusi n somos conscientes del equipo al que nos vamos a enfrentar pero lo haremos sin ning n tipo de miedo o de temor jugaremos con mucha motivaci n porque queremos seguir manteniendo la racha sin perder en riazor ante el madrid que es de muchos a os se habla ya de una tradici n

7744923 son necesarias porque en el servicio de noche es muy f cil proceder a detenciones que requieren rapidez no puedes tener a una persona en actitud violenta en medio de una muchedumbre esperando a que llegue un coche patrulla
7744924 donde hay un problema y se produce la llamada de los ciudadanos se resuelve pero la presencia policial sigue siendo escasa hay muchas cosas que se nos escapan porque no tenemos efectivos suficientes como para tenerlos repartidos por el centro y por las zonas de movida es imposible
7744925 las reacciones contra los polic as eran ocasionales pero se han cultivado durante a os se ve a venir y se dej ir en los ltimos a os llev bamos diciendo que se ten a que reforzar el servicio de noche que no se pod a hacer como se estaba haciendo
7744926 la actividad ha aumentado debido a la mayor movilidad de los ciudadanos a trav s del veh culo entre la ciudad y el rea metropolitana y ocasiona un aumento espectacular del tr fico de la problem tica del aparcamiento y de la problem tica de la circulaci n

7744933 es vital que se investiguen hasta el final las verdaderas causas de dicho accidente y que identifiquen correctamente a los fallecidos mediante pruebas de adn
7744934 es necesario reclamar con car cter extrajudicial y con la mayor brevedad posible a la compa a spanair y a su aseguradora adem s de exigir la correspondiente indemnizaci n de los da os y perjuicios causados

7744983 shes been an island of consideration and gentle criticism between randy jackson and simon cowell offering her invaluable expertise as a performer and no 1 artist with kara by her side paula finally has some backup and now there is going to be a lot more girl power on the show
7744984 yeah girl power you know i am concerned about the audience and acceptance but time will tell
7744985 it became too uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream especially when i realized that many of them have supported my career
7744986 that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7744987 dont you ever ever leave me out the top 10
7744988 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
7744989 when he takes the mound hes throwing filthy filthy stuff
7744990 six rbis a couple of homers i think its the right time
7744991 thats probably as good a performance as ive seen against us this year
7744992 whenever they give me the ball im going to take it
7744993 big difference is when the guys pounding the zone throwing strikes
7744994 when i got in i regretted it my hamstrings were tight and my quads hurt
7744995 were watching how were spending our money and paying debt down aggressively
7744996 its kind of fun with younger kids to say what do you think its going to cost and then talk through it
7744997 bringing the kids in helps them understand why we cant go to chuck e cheese this week
7744998 down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountaintop
7744999 no pod amos creer estar en la rural sent amos que estabamos volando y cuando nos dijeron que hab amos sido seleccionados para ir a terra madre nos abrazamos como dos chicos
7745000 cuando abro la ventana miro para un lado y est n las monta as y miro para el otro y est el valle de los comechingones
7745001 comenzamos produciendo 20 litros de cerveza como un hobbie y ahora producimos 1200 litros mensuales
7745002 there is not a liberal america and a conservative america there is the united states of america there is not a black america and a white america and latino america and asian america theres the united states of america the pundits the pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats but ive got news for them too we worship an awesome god in the blue states and we dont like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states we coach little league in the blue states and yes weve got some gay friends in the red states there are patriots who opposed the war in iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in iraq we are one people all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes all of us defending the united states of america
7745003 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7745004 were watching how were spending our money and paying debt down aggressively
7745005 its kind of fun with younger kids to say what do you think its going to cost and then talk through it
7745006 bringing the kids in helps them understand why we cant go to chuck e cheese this week
7745007 we realized that if we were able to align ourselves appropriately with strategies underway in the community and if our investments were in line with investments ongoing in the community we would be able take care of our needs first and foremost and create a positive ripple effect in the community
7745008 looked to spend money on projects that serve the universitys needs but in a way that would have a positive impact on the community
7745009 c u picked infrastructure and housing because these were areas that benefited from mutual self interest between the county and university
7745010 a lot of jobs at cornell such as cooks and groundskeepers are where the wage is such that those workers dont even live in the county because they cant afford to live there so the benefit of those jobs goes outside the county and host communities see little benefit
7745011 the university does recognize it gets a significant benefit from its tax exemption status with respect to taxes
7745012 through taxes paid by its employees vendors and contractors as well as local taxes and fees that the university pays directly cornell in 2005 directly or indirectly generated an estimated 173 million in state and local tax revenues for every dollar that new york state spent in support of cornells operations it got back 72 cents in state and local tax revenues
7745013 faculty jobs are more beneficial to the community because faculty buy property in the county have to pay property taxes and contribute to more local sales tax benefiting the host community
7745014 nys to partially compensate communities where a tax exempt state university campus is located for lost property tax revenues
7745015 the bill is dead on arrival people say be thankful you have the college there and you have the students spending money as well as their parents its a clean industry that creates good jobs and you should be grateful
7745016 this bill is going to sit as much as id like to see something happen but given where we are and as state and as country its not likely its seen as luxury to spend money in this way
7745017 any city in new york state is facing real economic pressure and could use economic assistance
7745018 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7745019 i do not support roe versus wade it should be overturned
7745020 the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine hes erratic hes hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7745021 mccain sides with bush on torture again supports veto of anti waterboarding bill
7745022 black claims mccains campaign is above lobbyist influence i dont know what the criticism is
7745023 mccain very honored by support of pastor preaching end time confrontation with iran

7745027 cross link two amino acids in the hair to form stable heat and humidity resistant bonds
7745028 in 1969 while speaking at a small scientific conference sir roger penrose a cambridge physicist announced his discovery of what he called a gravitationally totally collapsed object the world yawned
7745029 months later he changed his description to a black hole and the news of his discovery raced around the world today the term black hole is a part of the worlds working vocabulary
7745030 what is the difference between a gravitationally totally collapsed object
7745031 we cant understand nor do we care about a collapsed object but a black hole is something very different it is provocative intriguing exciting and conceptual most important it is believable
7745032 if someone tells you that a name really doesnt matter tell them about a black hole tell them that a name does matter
7745033 what made you choose this color instead of its opposite why did you use this font why did you include this particular graphic here
7745034 all of us together suffered thats how we can survive
7745035 when i was younger i hoped and waited for outside help to come to our country and liberate it
7745036 now i realize that we have to rely on ourselves
7745037 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7745038 its not going to be one of the major sports but it got a lot more people into the world of swimming
7745039 theres always a possibility especially when someone like phelps comes along
7745040 i dont want this sport to be an every four years sport
7745041 yeah we get the most attention every four years at the olympics but in between those four years theres really not as much exposure for us
7745042 it encourages me and all the other swimmers to keep doing what were doing
7745043 hes definitely an inspiration to me and all the swimmers
7745044 it was cool to see all the coverage the underwater cameras and everything
7745045 it gets you in the mood to get into the pool and see if you can go fast
7745046 the first thing to remember is how to protect yourself
7745047 as our work involves using glow in the dark paints on a daily basis in childrens rooms it was important to find a totally safe paint that would not have adverse effects on us during the application stage and also to the child using the room once each job was completed with the introduction of our new superstarz range of paints we now have that peace of mind
7745048 i am delighted now that benjamin sleeps not only with the light off but also with his door shut this is something i thought we would never achieve but now he cant wait to see his ceiling
7745049 when i came here i came because of the pension
7745050 i worked for less because i was looking toward the future
7745051 when i came on it was under funded and its still under funded
7745052 because it requires deep cuts to basic core services it will depend on how much the public will allow
7745053 you cant invest your way out of this i dont think you cant cut our way out either
7745054 well have to look at a combination of tax increases increased investments and maybe increased cuts
7745055 we have to convince voters we dont want to be back talking about this again
7745056 it was just great to meet him and meet people you usually see on tv like tennis no1 rafael nadal and roger federer
7745057 for me michael phelps is a real inspiration and someone you really look up to
7745058 thats her business and now that were friends its not something i have to worry about
7745059 shes a mature girl and makes her own decisions and were just enjoying being friends and thats something you just cant take away
7745060 were enjoying being good friends we spent two years together and thats something you dont forget quickly
7745061 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7745062 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
7745063 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government
7745064 i dont anticipate it would have any impact on our joint efforts to combat extremism
7745065 all cell phones must be off i must not know they exist
7745066 oh no my girl has mrs x as her teacher
7745067 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
7745068 i do not ask that you take them out of the world but that you keep them from the evil one they do not belong to the world any more than i belong to the world consecrate them in the truth your word is truth
7745069 resist the beginnings remedies come too late when by long delay the evil has gained strength
7745070 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7745071 i love you because every day is christmas when were together
7745072 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7745073 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7745074 estoy muy preocupado por el mensaje que las c maras alta y baja del parlamento ruso dirigieron al presidente medv dev solicitando reconocer a abjasia y osetia del sur regiones de georgia como pa ses independientes
7745075 pido a los dirigentes de rusia cumplir sus compromisos y no reconocer a estas regiones separatistas
7745076 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7745077 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7745078 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7745079 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7745080 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7745081 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7745082 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home
7745083 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7745084 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7745085 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7745086 political business or technology reasons there is always a time when i have to return when we look ten years into the future maybe yes i may well end up spending more time on the metal gear series
7745087 in mgs4 yes i put everything in the cut sequences which i kind of regret to some extent because maybe there is a new approach which i should think about
7745088 lack a kind of deeper storyline or the expression of the feelings of the characters
7745089 despite taking significant number of potential toublemakers off the streets and seizing dozens of weapons a small minority still managed to marr the end of what had been a largely good natured and peaceful two days of celebrations
7745090 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7745091 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7745092 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7745093 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7745094 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7745095 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7745096 we cannot keep these people if we dont pay them
7745097 we thought more people would be able to participate in this
7745098 sometimes its tough to get here because of the traffic
7745099 its nice theyre inviting the community to be part of the building
7745100 were excited for the branch but well still come here too
7745101 we came to retrieve those last books before school i was happy to sign
7745102 weve had community members come to us who went to school in u 46 mobiles and now their children and grandchildren are going through the same thing just how long is temporary
7745103 when they have a school that is under capacity why are we not giving the parents the choice their kids could be bused to a less crowded school
7745104 i always get anxious with the start of year probably more so than the students
7745105 every day since july 1 i have tried to enter the building from a different door to find my way around
7745106 someone can tell you what its like to walk into neuqua valley for your first day as principal but you dont know until you walk through those doors yourself
7745107 were going to keep our traditions intact and were going to make a new one challenging every student every day
7745108 there seems to be great deal of pride in having those events
7745109 theres a deliberateness about bringing adults together at the school to celebrate student achievement
7745110 whether its a student mastering a new skill or a teacher learning a new technique were going to do it with excellence
7745111 this is not about not supporting the affected communities because we do
7745112 if its going to happen we need to extract the maximum benefit for citizens
7745113 i thought this was a community of inclusion not exclusion
7745114 im saving gas im getting exercise where is that wrong
7745115 and when did commuters become the worst people in the world
7745116 ive never heard a complaint about commuter parking on eighth i cant believe weve spent this much time on it
7745117 its three spots we have a parking garage we spent millions of dollars and staff hours to make it all perfect its there lets use it
7745118 we arent wiped out as a species in the span of a week
7745119 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7745120 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7745121 she hasnt talked to anyone she just looks like your sweet little grandma and no one knows where she is
7745122 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7745123 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients
7745124 it wont damage the building or contents but it will make it uncomfortable
7745125 were going to see a lot of young players play thursday
7745126 duane has done everything weve asked he still needs to get better of course but hes caught on faster than i thought he would
7745127 hes got the mentality you want when he gets beat it doesnt faze him usually when young guys get beat theyll soften up a little because theyre afraid of getting beat again not duane he doesnt play with any fear he gets after it on every play no matter what
7745128 we knew he was a runner who needed to get used to going north south and hes gotten better he only did it once against dallas where he really made progress was his pass protection
7745129 corners are going to give up a big play and i like his demeanor he gives me the impression that its not going to bother him a ton he can play the next play
7745130 there would have been nothing better than putting a w on the board and waving goodbye to this place but it didnt work out that way
7745131 i had the opportunity to play with him in florida hes well prepared hes probably one of the most prepared guys that ive ever played with as far as scouting pitchers hes a hall of famer one day he just took a pitch and drove it out
7745132 thats probably as good a performance as ive seen this year pitched against us
7745133 he was down in the strike zone at 92 and 94 mph the ball was running sinking
7745134 we felt like we had a chance to win three of four and we ran into a good pitcher tonight
7745135 the guy threw predominantly all fastballs and you got one run so that tells you how much it was moving you tip your hat to him
7745136 they played good we played bad and therefore thats what makes up for the score
7745137 two goals down after the first 30 minutes is difficult to overcome
7745138 i dont think we had that little zip in our step that we had in our last couple of games and all around the field we were just below average
7745139 the most solid performance weve had so far since ive been here
7745140 we didnt match them physically we didnt match them tactically and we got soundly beaten and got what we deserved
7745141 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7745142 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7745143 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7745144 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7745145 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7745146 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7745147 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7745148 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7745149 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7745150 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7745151 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7745152 theyre able to make a lifetime decision at 18 when i was recruited everybody made a four or five year decision on where youre going to play football were able to talk to them about 40 years from now 50 years from now
7745153 and say after five years we expect you to be the boss after 10 years we expect you to pay your scholarship back after 30 years we expect you to have a building named after you its not just a sales pitch
7745154 everybody we coach has a chance to be a future leader of america
7745155 we have to create a culture that you win and you graduate
7745156 its definitely an exciting year for all of us theres definitely more enthusiasm a better attitude than ive ever seen
7745157 thats one of our goals as a team to build family and passion as well as unity the last thing is accountability when we mess up outside in the summer were all doing extra running
7745158 jim wacker had me do that i know the pride i took as a player doing the little things for coach wacker which showed he trusted us and that it was our football team
7745159 we know we have good coaches we know we have a great overall school when we play other teams now its not ok we have rice homecoming we want teams to fear rice
7745160 it may be this year i dont know when its coming but its coming
7745161 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7745162 today we declare a long long holiday for the government
7745163 i think police are still able to control the situation so there is no need to send the soldiers out to stop the protesters
7745164 my love will not die please let it be known
7745165 do you want me to sing to you ill sing all night if it will keep the bad dreams away
7745166 why cant i seem to find u in this world of pure clearness

7745170 uzumaki naruto i have been hearing some rather unpleasant rumors about things you have been saying about me and the other mathletes it would do you good to formulate ways to raise the probability of your victory against the total sum of our powers

7745175 ambition is a poor excuse for not having sense enough to be lazy
7745176 never be afraid to laugh at yourself after all you could be missing out on the joke of the century
7745177 what are you afraid of a fate worse than death
7745178 you have to sing for the angels and i have to tell them stories we share the same fate it seems

7745181 mr dink underwent prosecution under article 301 of the turkish criminal code as he spoke about the armenian genocide
7745182 legal measures were taken about mr dink as he regarded the events that happened in 1915 as genocide
7745183 biden has so far been involved in all kinds of movements which are against turkey
7745184 i must say that im surprised with obamas selection of biden it is not easy to be happy with this selection when looking from turkey and considering bidens almost two decade long firm support of the armenian disaporas efforts for recognition of their allegations of a genocide
7745185 the only thing we can do now as citizens of turkey is to wish obama and biden luck although this combination is not very hope inspiring from turkeys perspective however the most important duty for nongovernmental organizations and the media as well as politicians is to thoroughly inform the obama camp about turkeys policies and understanding on certain issues we should engage both the mccain and obama camps before one of them is elected not after the election is over
7745186 i believe domestic public opinion will follow mccains strategies during the electioneering more closely than before given the disappointment over bidens selection
7745187 to achieve olympic glory for the motherland is the sacred mission assigned by the communist party central
7745188 weve got a planet to save nothing less is at stake other than civilization as we know it today

7745190 provide a wide variety of information products to the entire dod family
7745191 throughout the department of defense and to the american public high quality visual information products including combat camera imagery depicting u s military activities and operations
7745192 policies priorities and programs properly reflect dod wide and military service unique messages and strategic communications requirements
7745193 there is an agreement between both sides that no foreign soldiers will be in iraq after 2011
7745194 must be based on a specific deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces and that it should not be open
7745195 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7745196 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7745197 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7745198 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be
7745199 marlborough is showing some signs of slowing down but its holding up fairly well
7745200 its rating is certainly above what we gave the country a two star rating its not a red hot area but its doing fairly well considering the national climate
7745201 netball is fun and i really enjoy it but this is volleyball nationals thats better than a netball semi
7745202 were hoping to go pretty good weve definitely improved from last year
7745203 having nigel sowman as coach coming to tournaments has really helped and has taken a lot of the stress off senior team mates abbey greenwood and mel shearer
7745204 the whole team is going to have to step up
7745205 we obviously have our lynchpins with abbey greenwood and suzie wickham but those around them will have to play well too
7745206 even if one player isnt up to standard it will bring the whole team down to a level we know we can be better than everyones going to have to play out of their skins but i expect that from them
7745207 i took some wheat around the back to feed the fowls and there was a whole lot of feathers everywhere
7745208 as i got closer there was no sign of the fowls at all
7745209 we had a few chances but couldnt do it and they fully deserved to win

7745242 i can honestly say i dont get any favors like better grades than i deserve or anything like that ive earned my good grades the old fashioned way through paying attention in class and studying what im supposed to the funny thing is that with my breasts as large as they are people have a way of judging me as being stupid before they even get to know me like im a bimbo or something i definitely am not a bimbo and people find that out rather quickly in an academic setting like at the university so yes i do get treated differently sometimes but not usually in a good way

7745303 the god who speaks in scripture cannot refer to anything that is not already authoritatively revelational of himself
7745304 it might seem analogous to the case of a judge who accepts the witness of the accused in his own defense rather than evidence derived from all the relevant facts in the case it is fully admitted that normally it would be absurd and a miscarriage of justice for a judge to accept the testimony of the accused rather than the verdict required by all the relevant evidence but the two cases are not analogous there is one sphere where self testimony must be accepted as absolute and final this is the sphere of our relation to god god alone is adequate witness to himself

7745307 my god is about how isolationism is subconsciously applauded by our society yet it causes so many personal problems we are a self absorbed community believing we shouldnt need others and should be able to stand on our own however when we withdraw like that we become more and more numb to the human condition and our own emotions we begin living however we see fit and smile as accountability fades away this is treason of sorts knowing fully where our loyalties should lie but serving ourselves instead this song is a call to get back to god and the body of believers to pursue gods glory instead of our own selfishness
7745308 all of us are searching for an open arm and its a shame how i curl up in the dark when its the same old word giving me the spark all of us are searching for an open arm and its a shame how i curl up in the dark all of us are searching for an open arm and its a shame how i pull myself apart when its the same word making me run for cover to your heart

7745350 we needed to cut 100 000 from the fine arts budget and left it up to the directors to decide what would be eliminated
7745351 at kingwood high school we devised a plan where the 6 000 total will be split three ways between the all sports boosters the fillies boosters and our booster club the band boosters
7745352 this year we feel we can commit 2 000 for this purpose next year we will have to re evaluate our funding to see if we can continue this we are lucky enough to not have our students pay a band fee like other school districts to be a member of the band
7745353 we are planning to go to as many as we can currently we have decided that we can only attend three out of the four of the away games we are doing as much as we can right now
7745354 we are already asking the parents to pitch in and help us fund some activities and now we are asking again hopefully there will be a resolution to this problem so we can all attend these away games
7745355 it was never about us not wanting to go to away games we have thoroughly enjoyed traveling to these games in the past we will just have to see what happens in the future
7745356 while we do not know how our fundraising will go this year we are hopeful that we can continue to bring in the kind of funds needed to keep our band program strong
7745357 there seems to be a constant stream of kids wanting to be in band because of the excellent program we offer our booster club has always been thrifty with our budget and we are always looking for new income streams
7745358 it is amazing to watch a student learn how to be a band student
7745359 watching and listening to them perform is what i love directing is an art form and all of the students success is a daily journey we are excited about this band season and what is to come

7745392 i dont know how feasible it is to go back and start changing the order of finishes in all those events its an incredibly complicated issue
7745393 theres only one thing that would be wrong and that is to do nothing which is what the ioc has chosen
7745394 if you can open a door open it if you can flip a switch flip it if you arent killing anything youre going the wrong way
7745395 we need people to look at any suspicious activity write down license plate numbers and work with the police
7745396 theres no weird science no magic wand to solve robberies
7745397 weve arrested 52 robbery suspects in the last 60 days almost solely based on the publics help
7745398 we have a walking officer in our neighborhood and he keeps us in the loop
7745399 hes pretty much here five days a week from 1 to 9 p m
7745400 we advocated very hard to bring him back and its made all the difference in the world
7745401 i like to call it putting cops on the dots
7745402 we look at where these crimes are happening what days of the week and what time of day and thats where we put our police
7745403 if we say hey i got you on tape for example suspects will sometimes confess
7745404 but if the suspect has seen a small clip of footage on tv theyll look and say oh they didnt get me its happened three or four times recently reporters pressuring store owners to release their video and in turn hurt some of our investigative techniques
7745405 when we make arrests the media doesnt care so the people dont know that makes these guys more bold more brazen
7745406 but the people of oakland can make all the difference here we need their help
7745407 everyone thats reported back in says things couldnt have gone smoother
7745408 shes very shy and has a hard time letting go
7745409 la gente que no nos conoce al principio se asusta pero karan siempre se los gana con su sonrisa
7745410 tiene una naturaleza muy alegre y ya empezo a caminar todo lo que come le da energias extra porque es muy fuerte
7745411 creia que nunca encontraria a una mujer de mi altura pero en cuanto vi a svetlana supe que hariamos una gran pareja
7745412 weve agreed to the next step which will hopefully provide a solution we are committed to pursuing all of our options with fred timms
7745413 i did have too much stuff in there i know but i was dealing with it
7745414 i was packing it up getting it organized to move and that was when the fire marshal came there are other apartments that are worse than mine but those residents are still in their apartments
7745415 all they have to do is shuffle a few papers and i would be in an apartment somewhere regina towers ramsey somewhere
7745416 when the reason to do something is really big then the way how you do it will be so small
7745417 its fitting that it all started in iowa on a cold winter night
7745418 ive always said obama is going to win iowa but hes going to have to earn it
7745419 and i think they can be turned off its not done right
7745420 the devising of transformation in a planned and systematic fashion
7745421 the reactions to changes in which the organisation has no control
7745422 truly truly i say to you you seek me not because you saw signs but because you ate of the loaves and were filled do not work for the food which perishes but for the food which endures to eternal life which the son of man will give to you for on him the father god has set his seal
7745423 what shall we do so that we may work the works of god
7745424 what then do you do for a sign so that we may see and believe you
7745425 truly truly i say to you it is not moses who has given you the bread out of heaven but it is
7745426 i am the bread that came down out of heaven
7745427 truly truly i say to you unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in yourselves
7745428 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7745429 life is for the livin the forgivin and for leavin town alive
7745430 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7745431 it shows the level of desperation and abuse of power by the barisan nasional
7745432 i am confident god willing we will win but we are fighting an entire government machinery which has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to deny me a victory
7745433 yes there are mps in the ruling party that have expressed support for me
7745434 the issue of the sodomy allegations while it gained some traction at the beginning of the campaign by the end had reached saturation point and wont significantly affect his chances of winning
7745435 if you look at the ground support it is extremely good but we have to make sure there is no cheating
7745436 i voted for wan azizah i will vote for anwar ibrahim because i want the barisan nasional to be toppled
7745437 its like a musician playing someone elses work and adding a personal stamp
7745438 no though i could get to like it i like schlager

7745443 look at this guy in 7th place thats gotta suck to come to the olympics and get 7th place
7745444 hes like 20 and the 7th fastest runner in the world josh youre 19 and cant even get hired at pizza hut
7745445 under the hardness of her facade a womans heart is still beating
7745446 it was fitting that the she who had kept her virginity intact in childbirth should keep her own body free from all corruption even after death it was fitting that she who had carried the creator as a child at her breast should dwell in the divine tabernacles it was fitting that the spouse whom the father had taken to himself should live in the divine mansions it was fitting that she who had seen her son upon the cross and who had thereby received into her heart the sword of sorrow which she had escaped when giving birth to him should look upon him as he sits with the father it was fitting that gods mother should possess what belongs to her son and that she should be honored by every creature as the mother and as the handmaid of god
7745447 we are aware of the part played by divine grace in the virgin marys life and are aware of the perfection of her virtue however we cannot lose sight of the importance of free will in the development and expression of her rich personality after the annunciation she kept the secret of gods plan for her she faced misunderstanding and accusation from others she quickly visited her cousin elizabeth not thinking of her own needs but only the need of elizabeth to share her joy she endured the journey to bethlehem she humbly prepared for the birth of her child and obediently accepted the command to flee into egypt the virgin mary aided by divine grace carried out these actions in a real world with real effort and sacrifice thus she is for us a model of many virtues
7745448 i told him i said look man i just need you to run and hit
7745449 dont do too much thinking youve got people coming behind you that can correct some of your mistakes
7745450 hes not all the way there but i like his aggressiveness from otas all the way up until this point
7745451 curtis had six good hits and did a nice job coming downhill
7745452 he was all that we anticipated he handled the logistics of getting our front set it was good to see our rookie middle linebacker out there
7745453 for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing
7745454 what is that four games in a row i beat you
7745455 oh ashley your so much fun or your so funny
7745456 oh rock springs will be my starting over place ill pay my bills and hopefully meet a guy start dating and see where it goes
7745457 maybe you have another calling in life this just isnt working for you
7745458 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in
7745459 it really felt good were progressing way ahead of schedule
7745460 they warmed me up well i didnt think about the knee i rolled out quite a bit the knee didnt give at all it felt fine
7745461 hes a little bit out of shape you can see the tempo and the pace of the passing game is picking up he looks good he looks ready to go i cant see any reason he wont play im really hoping mark can hold up and hang in there and get us off to a good start
7745462 hes not way out of shape but hes not in his best shape
7745463 they both have worked really hard they both have to get ready to play this week
7745464 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set
7745465 i am a little bit tired yes but it is the u s open so i have to try my best here
7745466 i think i helped him a little bit to play to this level but hes a good player and he played well today
7745467 i learned that i could play with the no 1 in the world
7745468 i had my chances but i missed too much it was really fun to play in front of a big crowd
7745469 i think a lot of things go into having the ability to win a slam
7745470 talent gets you to a certain level and then the hard work starts to kick in and if youre not putting in the hard work youre not going to get the opportunities to win a grand slam
7745471 ive really stepped up my work load off the court and started traveling with a fitness trainer i think thats the big difference in my game and the reason why i have the potential to come through and win a slam
7745472 i think even though federer was still the favorite for wimbledon there were still guys that had a chance of doing some damage there
7745473 i think its really exciting for tennis theres obviously quite a few guys that have the potential to win it
7745474 id still say federer is one of the favorites but in terms of being unbeatable i think thats a mind set that isnt great if youre going on the court believing that you cant win against someone
7745475 i think its taken a few of the top guys to see federer lose to lower ranked players to start believing they can win against him
7745476 i still think federer is playing great tennis but the mind set of the other players has changed because hes lost more this year than he has in the past
7745477 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7745478 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7745479 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7745480 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7745577 not ready 08 a mile high and an inch deep
7745578 each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey
7745579 i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend
7745580 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7745581 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7745582 now you know why i asked her out so many times
7745583 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7745584 my mothers love has always been a sustaining force for our family and one of my greatest joys is seeing her integrity her compassion and her intelligence reflected in my own daughters
7745585 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7745586 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7745587 because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7745588 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7745589 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7745590 one of the most authentic and real women i know
7745591 for the first time in my adult life i am really proud of my country
7745592 i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7745593 and she wont be surprised and she wont be shocked
7745594 kevin rudd is he the man who occasionally deigns to visit australia and watch he seems to prefer to be always overseas or talking down the australian economy
7745595 whenever the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam would intend to go on a journey he would cast lots amongst his wives so whoevers lot would be picked would accompany the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam
7745596 so he cast these lots on one of these expeditions and my name came up so i traveled with the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam this was after the verses pertaining to hijab were revealed and therefore i would travel in my hawdaj and be carried in it
7745597 after the expedition had finished and we were returning to madinah the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam gave orders to camp the night outside of madinah
7745598 the women could prepare themselves and the hair that needed to be removed could be removed
7745599 when the orders were given to encamp i stood up and walked away from the army to relieve myself when i returned i felt my chest and lo and behold my onyx necklace had broken and fallen so i returned to where i had been to search for it i was delayed in searching for it and in the meantime the people that were assigned to carry my hawdaj had already placed it on top of the camel presuming that i was back in it
7745600 during those days women were very thin and they had not put on a lot of weight they used to only eat a few morsels of food so the men did not question the lightness of the hawdaj when they picked it up and put it on the camel and on top of that i was a young girl so they sent the camel forward and i found my necklace after they had gone by the time i returned to the caravan camping ground there was not a soul in sight
7745601 on top of that i was a young girl still young in age
7745602 so i stayed in my place and i presumed that they would discover that i was missing and they would return for me while i was waiting in my place sleep got the better of me so i fell asleep
7745603 safwan ibn muaqqal as sulami one of the companions was lagging behind the army for some reason he was late so he was not up with the army and he walked up to my place he saw the shape of a person sleeping and when he saw me he recognized me for he had seen me before the revelation of the verses of the hijab i was woken up by his exclamation of la hawla wa la quwwatta ila billaah when he recognized me so i covered my face with my outer garment
7745604 he recognized her because he had seen her before the verses of hijab had been revealed
7745605 as soon as she saw him she covered her face with her outer garment
7745606 and i swear by allah we did not speak a word to each other nor did i hear any statement from him except la hawla wa la quwwatta illaa billaah he lowered his camel such that i could ride on it and when i mounted the camel he guided it until we caught up with the caravan while they were encamped that is where the rumors started spreading and the people that spread the rumors were destroyed the leader of them was abdullaah ibn ubay ibn salul
7745607 so we arrived in madinah but i fell ill with a fever for a whole month
7745608 after i had been cured i once exited with umm mistah aishas great aunt and the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallams first cousin towards the area that we used to relieve ourselves
7745609 what an evil thing you have said how can you curse a person who has witnessed the battle of badr
7745610 my dear child did you not hear what he is saying about you
7745611 do you give me permission to go to my parents house for i desire to verify the information from them and he agreed
7745612 i asked my mother umm ruman my dear mother what are the people talking about
7745613 my daughter be easy upon yourself by allah it hardly occurs that a wife is so beloved to her husband and she has co wives at the same time except that they talk about her
7745614 i cried that night i cried and cried until the morning came my tears could not stop nor could i taste the sweetness of sleep
7745615 they cannot be guilty they must be innocent they are your wives and we know nothing but good about them
7745616 ya rasulallah allah has not restricted matters upon you and there are plenty of women beside her ask her maidservant she will confirm what she knows about her
7745617 ya barira have you ever seen anything from aisha that will cause you to have doubts about her
7745618 by him who has sent you with the truth i have not seen anything from her what so ever that will cause me to have doubts about her except one thing except that she is a young girl who sometimes falls asleep when she is kneading the dough and when she falls asleep the lamb comes eats the dough and goes away so this is the crime that i know she does
7745619 oh gathering of believers who will excuse me from a person who has hurt me even with regards to my wives whatever i do you have nothing to blame me with now if i were to do anything to this man referring to abdullah ibn ubayy ibn salul then you cannot blame me he has affected me slandered me and he has even reached my wife can anyone blame me for anything i do to him now who will give me an excuse by allah i only know good about my wife and they have mentioned a man with her concerning whom i only know good of as well
7745620 i excuse you ya rasulallah if this person be from among the aws then i will cut his head off and if he be from among my brethren of the khazraj then command us and we will do your bidding
7745621 by allah you have lied you cannot kill him nor are you able to kill him rather had he been from your tribe you would not have liked that he be killed
7745622 saad had been before this incident a righteous man but the tribalism of the jahiliyyah overtook him
7745623 rather you are the liar and we will surely kill him you are only a hypocrite defending the other hypocrite
7745624 so i continued to cry that day and my tears would not stop flowing until i believed that my liver would split open due to my tears while i was sitting and crying my parents were with me and one of the ansar ladies asked permission to enter and started crying with me
7745625 while we were in that state the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam entered upon us said salam and sat down
7745626 stopped crying until she could not even feel a single tear in her eyes
7745627 respond to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam on my behalf answer him say something
7745628 respond to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam say something tell him i didnt do this
7745629 what can i say to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam
7745630 i was still a young girl at that time and had not memorized much of the quran so i could not remember the name of the father of yusuf
7745631 i know by allah that you have heard these rumors and that these rumors have settled in your heart and soul and you have believed it already so if i were to tell you that im not guilty you wouldnt believe me and if i were to admit to a crime that i did not commit then you will believe me and think that i did it so all i can say to you is what the father of yusuf said patience is beautiful and allah subhaanahu wa taaalas help is sought concerning what you describe
7745632 i turned around on my bed allah knew i was innocent of this charge and i knew that allah would reveal my innocence however wallahi i never thought that allah would reveal quran concerning me i thought myself far too low in the sight of allah that allah would speak about me rather i was hoping that the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam might see in his dream something that would declare my innocence
7745633 when the revelation finished the prophet sal alaahu alayhi wa sallam started laughing out of happiness
7745634 so my mother stood up and told me stand up to thank the prophet sal allahu alayhi wa sallam
7745635 no by allah i will not stand up to him rather i will thank allah subhaanahu wa taaala
7745636 wallahi i will never give a single penny to mistah as long as i live
7745637 balaa yes of course i wish that allah forgives me wallahi i will never stop paying mistah as long as i live
7745638 the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam had already asked zainab ibn jahsh about me and she was my main rival from amongst the prophets wives
7745639 so allah saved her because of her piety but her sister hamana thought she was fighting on her behalf by spreading the slander so she was destroyed along with those that were destroyed
7745640 and the man they had accused safwan ibn muaqqil when the rumors were going on he would say subhan allah by him in whose hands is my soul i have never raised the veil of any woman in my life for at that time he had not yet been married
7745641 in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it
7745642 the approach theyre taking seems to me little more than petty bullying
7745643 i dont think this will be permanent when i have the time and can find a good copyright lawyer ill be figuring out exactly what my position is and how i can make tris available again
7745644 dass es nicht zu einer versch rfung jetzt am beginnenden wahlkampf kommt sondern dass besinnung und vor allem vernunft einkehren und man sich auch in hei en wahlkampfphasen davon leiten l sst
7745645 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7745646 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7745647 in order to get this condition accepted every other part of
7745648 there are a lot of pros and a lot of cons to us playing at jmu
7745649 to be honest with you i havent the slightest idea what our attendance is going to be like
7745650 i do think on saturdays and sundays we may draw some people though maybe not as many as we would for a 7 30 game but then some older people may want to go at 5 instead of coming out for a 7 30 game because that puts them home by 8 or 9 oclock so well just wait and see what our attendance is going to be
7745651 but that would have been such a hassle we have a lot of elderly people that come to games and thats such a long walk we wouldve had to get plenty of golf carts to get them back and forth
7745652 i wanted to tread the waters and just see what kind of crowd you could get if you played at 5 in the afternoon
7745653 and it could work out for teams that come from covington and lexington and haymarket and fauquier because they could be back home by 9 30 or 10 instead of 2 a m
7745654 all of us really agreed that it was a good move for him
7745655 its a very good relationship i think that we have with the turks our goal is to find ways to make it work for him in the interim before the new facility is built
7745656 the placebo has always been the norm of medical practice
7745657 to provoke placebo researchers into justifying mild deception overstating the benefits of a treatment perhaps or underplaying the potential risks
7745658 prescribing ssri antidepressants for mild depression is a bad idea because the evidence for benefit is very limited
7745659 do you think it is acceptable to prescribe a homeopathic sugar pill for mild depression given that the evidence of benefit there is equivalently poor
7745660 i think we might be able to help you a little bit with this particular sugar pill for this particular reason
7745661 dont have knock out drugs that work with that kind of refinement and precision
7745662 my concern is not so much whether effects of placebo are real or not but whether there is evidence for clinically relevant effects
7745663 most of us working in the field think thats just another way of saying be a good doctor
7745664 husbands love your wives even as christ loved the church
7745665 as for yourself you must say what is consistent with sound doctrine namely that older men should be temperate dignified self controlled sound in faith love and endurance
7745666 urge the younger men similarly to control themselves showing yourself as a model of good deeds in every respect with integrity in your teaching dignity
7745667 the moral virtue which under the cardinal virtue of temperance provides for the successful integration of sexuality within the person leading to the inner unity of the bodily and spiritual being
7745668 learn from me for i am meek and humble of heart
7745669 seek the sweetness of aromatic honey in courtesy and suavity with strangers but also the sweetness of milk among those of our household and our neighbors a sweetness terribly lacking to some who are as angels abroad and devils at home
7745670 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
7745671 amen amen i say to you unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies it remains just a grain of wheat but if it dies it produces much fruit whoever loves his life loses it and whoever hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life
7745672 let the children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom belongs to such as these
7745673 husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
7745674 its our senior year and we would like to see another banner go up
7745675 we pride ourselves on having no drama and having really strong team chemistry

7745780 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
7745781 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7745782 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
7745783 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
7745784 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
7745785 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
7745786 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
7745787 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
7745788 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
7745789 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
7745790 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
7745791 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
7745792 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
7745793 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
7745794 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
7745795 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
7745796 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
7745797 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
7745798 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
7745799 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

7745809 in our view this data is a strong indicator that performance of the mobile carriers network is affecting the iphone 3g more than the handset itself

7745855 every day since july 1 i have tried to enter the building from a different door to find my way around
7745856 someone can tell you what its like to walk into neuqua valley for your first day as principal but you dont know until you walk through those doors yourself
7745857 were going to keep our traditions intact and were going to make a new one challenging every student every day
7745858 there seems to be great deal of pride in having those events
7745859 theres a deliberateness about bringing adults together at the school to celebrate student achievement
7745860 whether its a student mastering a new skill or a teacher learning a new technique were going to do it with excellence
7745861 we encourage naperville residents to participate in the special census as it benefits all areas of the city especially those that have experienced growth since the last special census
7745862 it helps us to better know the citizenry of naperville in order to provide better services for them
7745863 we spent two years and nine months there we have no idea what to expect from short term exposure to heavy doses of radiation
7745864 but i have no idea what the defense is going to be it seems pretty cut and dry the riesses have been wronged
7745865 i dont think im going to live long enough to find the answers to that
7745866 you keep saying were going to do the study and put it on the ballot
7745867 theres probably two to three years of work after the study to even get it on the ballot
7745868 it needs to be dealt with because i lost most of the feeling in my right arm and am having pain in my shoulder
7745869 im losing 20 percent of my strength per day if i dont do anything about it the injury will end up rupturing and then the surgery will be more difficult its not easy because surgery never is
7745870 its a different injury than the pectoral tear because that was more of a muscle injury this is concerning my bones which has a lot less blood flow than muscle tissue it also has to do with my neck which is a very fragile area
7745871 every moment i stay away from the table is another moment something bad can happen the disk is so bulged out and inflamed that any sudden move could make it worse
7745872 david twohy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7745873 the chronicles of riddick was presented as a three part trilogy that would answer pitch black in the same way that lord of the rings answered the hobbit
7745874 everyone knows i love the riddick character and im always working on it it just takes five years to make another one because david twohy and i are so precious about it
7745875 i can tell you its a flashback scene it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
7745876 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film at first we didnt film that and now some people are saying they want to see a bit more
7745877 as i watched k ci and jojos performance at the womens day concert on wednesday night i was fuming already planning what i was going to write about the ridiculous farce of an act the hailey brothers were putting on
7745878 when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person i almost fell off the chair
7745879 i would rather play for the twins than any other team in the major leagues
7745880 i called up there and talked to the athletic directors secretary and said my name is kirk ferentz from iowa
7745881 i said i really dont want to go through that process i just wanted to inquire
7745882 im not a big network guy i didnt realize kevin had been at loras when i actually went up and interviewed i got off the plane and kevin said i just got off the phone with mike reilly i looked at kevin and said im too dumb for you to hire i didnt even make the connection loras dubuque mike reilly jim played for us long story short i got the job only because tom obrien former boston college and current north carolina state head coach didnt want it thats who they wanted to hire im always the second choice third choice fourth choice
7745883 ive got four screaming kids running around and all heck has broken loose and the phone rings
7745884 it was kevin white on the other end of the phone ive got four kids just screaming and were talking on the phone little did i know at the time that kevin had four kids too
7745885 the things i remember most about kirk great teacher especially in the offensive line
7745886 he was an inspiration to a lot of people around him hes got five kids hes a great dad and husband just the way he lives his life and i think hes one of the fairest human beings ive ever been around just the way he treated people
7745887 everything about kirk is done with a high level of integrity hes a very humble man and its easy to see why hes been so successful over the years
7745888 the first thing i learned was when coach fry shut the door he wasnt in there reading the paper drinking coffee and watching tv like i always thought he was
7745889 thats the first thing i learned there was a lot more to it than appeared to be
7745890 saya jujur aja seneng banget peran komedi makanya ketika mendapat kesempatan jadi pemeran utama saya seneng banget
7745891 review of the progress of steam shipping during the last quarter of a century
7745892 sesuai tema dan judul konser pintu surga itu lagu yang biasa dibawain gigi surgamu itu lagu ungu kita saling nge cross aja saling tukeran lagu
7745893 ini konser kita yang pertama karena ternyata musik religi kita berbeda kalau dari musik gigi lebih ngerock kalau kita ungu lebih ngepop tapi justru jadi unik dua unsur yang berbeda menjadi satu
7745894 the markets always find a new way to make a fool out of you
7745895 you know you shouldnt tease like that its not nice
7745896 the austin market has been attractive to a number of industry sectors particularly businesses in information technology creating a strong job market and attracting people to the region
7745897 residential properties that are well managed and maintained will benefit from this growth
7745898 what we believe are going to be the higher growth markets in terms of jobs and household formations
7745899 we believe that this will lead to better long term growth for us
7745900 will continue to always evaluate our portfolios and be in markets that make the most sense long term
7745901 do over time outperform the central part of the country
7745902 that just reflects that we build so much in texas and that holds down rent growth in the big picture your return does tend to be better in san francisco and washington d c than it is in most texas markets
7745903 it blows away what any other market in the country is doing
7745904 unless there is a dramatic surge in leasing activity occupancy will continue to drop followed by declines in rent by the end of the year
7745905 will not last very long because very few new projects will break ground in the next six months
7745906 id never say that but alaska has the talent theyve got the engineers theyve got the corrosion focus and weve now got the risk assessment process we need to prioritize
7745907 to look at congress and look at the american people and say that we made a huge mistake and were sorry thats hard thats very hard
7745908 non condivido il pessimismo sullalitalia prima di sapere qual la proposta
7745909 film das casting wurde unter der leitung von ghost whisperer
7745910 god ill miss out what if i cant go next week
7745911 hey its not so bad i listen to her a lot
7745912 my dad and i decided to make this film to answer peoples questions
7745913 which screened on monday morning here in denver after opening theatrically this weekend the filmmaker joined forces with distributor
7745914 in a time when really really good documentaries are struggling to get attention to have an event like this is really something
7745915 engineering windows 7 sera une plateforme d change entre les d veloppeurs et le public
7745916 in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7745917 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital ten years ago this summer inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands determined to give her everything hed struggled so hard for himself determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7745918 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7745919 a woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle
7745920 no that is wrong there is another point of view
7745921 i dont know why you are making such a big deal about it
7745922 why the hell dont you women get over it and take the gender out of it
7745923 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
7745924 with the small number in the summer we didnt notice the problem
7745925 we are in constant conversation with moodlerooms and the moodle community
7745926 theyre watching it and were watching it when we notice that something is wrong we are immediately calling each other
7745927 there isnt a lot of content to semester book and professors are finding they can do the same things in moodle
7745928 we host moodle and we hire analysts and programmers to make changes to software to adapt it to lsu specifically
7745929 normally the users have to adapt to the software and then wait for patches to fix bugs or new versions to make it better
7745930 since i started using it has already become easier to use and new features have been added
7745931 it just takes time learning a new system and getting used to the quirks that are unique to moodle after using semester book and blackboard for so long
7745932 whenever you have more options it does make it less easy to navigate
7745933 but as soon as professors have worked on it they seem to be happier with it than the options in the past
7745934 with thousands of students using this for the first time were not expecting it to go perfectly
7745935 the old version could do a lot but figuring out how to do just the things you wanted was difficult
7745936 they have simplified the grade book to where it does only the stuff most folks want
7745937 in my course grades were determined by the overall sum of points
7745938 while i had no trouble dealing with straight forward grades the functions designed to deal with extra credit grades and dropped quizzes were troublesome
7745939 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7745940 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7745941 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7745942 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7745943 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7745944 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7745945 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7745946 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7745947 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7745948 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7745949 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7745950 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7745951 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7745952 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7745953 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7745954 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7745955 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7745956 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7745957 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7745958 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7745959 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7745960 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7745961 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7745962 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7745963 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7745964 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7745965 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7745966 this is a planning took where all things are going
7745967 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7745968 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7745969 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7745970 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7745971 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7745972 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7745973 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7745974 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7745975 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7745976 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7745977 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7745978 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7745979 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7745980 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7745981 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7745982 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7745983 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7745984 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7745985 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7745986 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7745987 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7745988 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7745989 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7745990 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7745991 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7745992 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7745993 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7745994 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7745995 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7745996 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7745997 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7745998 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7745999 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7746000 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7746001 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7746002 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7746003 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7746004 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7746005 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7746006 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7746007 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7746008 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7746009 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7746010 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7746011 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7746012 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7746013 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7746014 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7746015 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7746016 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7746017 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7746018 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7746019 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7746020 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7746021 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7746022 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7746023 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7746024 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7746025 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7746026 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7746027 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7746028 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7746029 weve basically been going through this standoff between buyers and sellers
7746030 were just seeing more and more increases in inventory and sales coming down
7746031 i cant buy another house until i sell my house up there
7746032 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7746033 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7746034 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7746035 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7746036 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7746037 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7746038 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7746039 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7746040 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7746041 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7746042 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7746043 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7746044 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7746045 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7746046 whats astonishing about this convention is that we are coming into it with the race a dead heat this is impossible
7746047 he radically changed the face of campaign finance proving that an unlikely candidate can shatter fundraising records without taking a dime from pacs or registered lobbyists in like he changed the dnc to do exactly the same no other politician has been able to do this

7746052 as a result ea does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the status of any discussions or negotiations with take two unless and until discussions between ea and take two have been terminated or such parties have entered into a transaction
7746053 it enables us to move beyond business as usual and take on the threats facing our environment that will inevitably effect all of us

7746063 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
7746064 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7746067 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

7746069 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7746070 this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario
7746071 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7746072 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7746086 but that means that the splinter is inside me and its not coming out and its going to be there for a really really long time
7746087 your body is always rubbing skin cells off and making new ones underneath to replace them any splinter eventually gets lifted off and rubbed away with the old skin theres nothing to worry about
7746088 i was very disappointed when i called for a shuttle pick up at 11pm from a bus stop after returning from new york city the bus schedule i received from the front desk instructed us to call for a shuttle pick up from the bus stop not a station a stop a bench and a sign i waited from 11pm until 12am calling three times at no point did anyone at the desk know where the shuttle driver was but they assured me he would stop by and were surprised when he didnt after waiting an hour i decided to walk back to the hotel during my walk i never did see the shuttle if it hadnt been so late in an unfamiliar town with no sidewalks i would have walked in the first place but to have been left for an hour in the middle of the night at a bus stop has really soured my experience i am extremely displeased with the shuttle driver thank you for taking my complaint into consideration

7746096 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7746097 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7746098 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7746099 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7746100 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed

7746103 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7746104 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7746105 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7746106 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7746107 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7746108 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7746109 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7746110 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7746111 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7746112 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7746113 the best thing about our store is our family of employees

7746124 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7746125 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7746126 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7746127 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7746128 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7746129 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is

7746136 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7746137 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7746138 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7746139 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7746140 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7746141 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7746142 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7746143 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7746144 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7746145 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7746146 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7746147 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7746148 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

7746155 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7746156 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7746157 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7746179 from what we see of their statements so far most of those will come out of the age and the sydney morning herald
7746180 to think you can do that without undermining the quality of those papers i think defies belief
7746181 it has applications for all types of buildings and trains and transport systems
7746182 it will quite clearly attract the attentions of many agencies looking at combating severe graffiti problems which cost taxpayers many millions of dollars each year in clean up
7746183 the security industry is an industry with around 2 7 billion dollars invested in it each year 40 per cent of that is actually spent in new south wales

7746185 taxpayers are now funding labor party polling simply because you no longer know what queenslanders want

7746221 whoever gets to be president whether its john mccain or barack obama in this election is going to inherit a monsterous load of problems and we have to work our way out of this as a country
7746222 hes had 4 at bats seen 11 pitches and made 5 outs
7746223 if for example sik sr released with say less number of prints i dont think they would gross the same amount
7746224 on a totally different note tdk looked to get to 530m up until last weekend but this weekend it took
7746225 when i referred chinks in jays methodology it was regarding arriving at nett number
7746226 if for example sik sr released with say less number of prints i dont think they would gross the same amount
7746227 on a totally different note tdk looked to get to 530m up until last weekend but this weekend it took
7746228 when i referred chinks in jays methodology it was regarding arriving at nett number
7746229 i was getting ready for the game and i was kind of feeling it and hoping it would go away
7746230 right before the game i was hitting in the cage and it was just kind of throbbing back there again that needed to be addressed and we were able to do that
7746231 it just turned out to be a little bit of scar tissue and inflammation in the whole side joint area
7746232 it was just inflamed dr robert watkins out in l a was saying theres nothing structurally wrong here your back looks good theres no need for surgery he said the joint was just inflamed and im sure thats what was causing the pain there
7746233 hes going to play today and tomorrow and then after that well see i might give him one day to relax a little bit he looked good he swung the bat good he hit a couple balls good hes going to be out there
7746234 i think the ball coming out of my hand today was a little better i hope to continue to move forward and continue to see improvement we prefer it be a little bit more drastic improvement than what we are seeing but it may be one day it just decides to turn around for us
7746235 we send them home immediately because they dont have any certainties here
7746236 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title
7746237 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder
7746238 certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7746239 chelsea were very strong last week and united will be even stronger than they are now if they sign dimitar berbatov from tottenham as i think they will in the next few days
7746240 weve been a good team over the past two seasons and im confident well be a decent team again
7746241 i went in at half time feeling quite pleased with us but we ran out of steam in the second half and people like carlos tevez and wayne rooney just popped the ball about when the heat went out of the game
7746242 we are a new team with a few players just getting over injuries and once we play a bit more and get to understand each other we will be okay
7746243 it was a bonus win we only drew here last season and we lost the season before that it is never an easy place to come but i thought we played good football
7746244 we had to play a pretty tight midfield unit without much width but it is good we wont slip too far behind what with having no league game next weekend
7746245 unsere grundforderung ist dass es ohne betriebsbedingte k ndigungen gehen muss

7746253 mido should start against yeovil he only returned on friday
7746254 i have heard nothing from wigan and i have told him he will get plenty of matches this season
7746255 he has come off the bench to score in both our first games of the season
7746256 he is part of things he should realise that by the way he has got on so far
7746257 we will have a strong side out against yeovil but you have to make sure that players who have been involved in the squad but not started games yet are given the opportunity to play
7746258 you cannot come into the first team at the drop of a hat so you need to be ready and to do that you must play matches like the carling cup
7746259 maybe we cannot win the premier league but we can win the carling cup we have done it before and we will be looking for a decent run in the competition
7746260 it is a competition that we can genuinely win we have to believe that it is a tournament we can go a long way in and we have done that in the past
7746261 ni te ko biti dober alpinist te ko pa je biti star alpinist
7746262 we could turn this country into chechnya we had enough people and equipment to do that or we had to do nothing and stay a modern european country
7746263 eventually we would have chased them away but we would have had to go to the mountains and grow beards that would have been a tremendous national philosophical and emotional burden
7746264 a lot of the investment in online advertising has been from technology focused folks trying to solve problems and impose solutions on a market
7746265 thats a good price but it really is a little too small
7746266 we are on track to meet our goal of operating the worlds first test flight on a large passenger aircraft using fuel sourced from jatropha in the last quarter of this year
7746267 weve got a number that have already left the business through natural attrition and we announced a couple of months ago a project to centralise some of our sub editing
7746268 well be finalising that process over the next couple of months
7746269 in terms of the front end journalist area there might be some but main thrust is in the sub editing
7746270 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile

7746276 people build their own prisons incarcerate themselves in them and make the environments every bit as bleak stark depressing and debilitating as the actual penitentiary i visited these peoples private prisons block walls are constructed of complaints and resentments the mortar from excuses the bars forged from pessimism and procrastination
7746277 almost every major scientific endeavor is first a break with tradition and old ways of thinking and old paradigms
7746278 what is most interesting is that increased exposure time did not improve the results

7746291 alex jones and the infowars team will be broadcasting live and posting updates from the democratic national convention in denver readers can catch exclusive coverage from the epicenter of the action as the crew document what is sure to be another demonstration of the police state in full flow
7746292 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7746293 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7746294 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7746327 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7746328 im just going to stay in my house and watch out for it
7746329 its important to make mental health services available to mothers after birth
7746330 theres so much work involved in caring for a newborn that parents overlook their emotional and mental health needs
7746331 the birth of a child is a positive experience but its also stressful for some people
7746332 although women are often the primary caregivers baby blues and postpartum depression can impact an entire family
7746333 it just started raining and it didnt want to stop
7746334 weve lost 50 percent of the crop we knew we were going to get a little rain but we didnt know we were going to get all this wind and rain together
7746335 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7746336 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7746337 through sheer hard work and putting the old principles back in place we were back in profit within three months
7746338 one of the driving forces for me to take the company back on was to rescue it from the jaws of the administrators
7746339 in addition many of the people who work here have been here for years and they have all responded to me taking the company back on with an immense amount of hard work
7746340 we now intend to consolidate our position within the rental market and when the time is right continue to grow the business most of my family think that im mad but ive not had a moment of regret since i took the company back on
7746341 in many ways i feel as though the lifetimes worth of business experience ive accrued have all been working towards this point
7746342 i just had to take a job but the one thing that i knew with any real certainly was that i didnt want to follow in the footsteps of my father as an engineer
7746343 so i looked through the situations vacant section of the newspaper and decided to take a job as a rent collector for
7746344 i was collecting 2s 9d each week and many of the tenants could not afford it there was no money about so properties were patched up and many had earth floors outdoor toilets and roofs that leaked
7746345 i found two tenants dead poor housing must have been a contributory factor
7746346 there was an element of luck about the success i accept that
7746347 but i like to think that the success the business enjoyed was also about timing and a fair amount of professional knowledge
7746348 i firmly believe that its success could place it on a par with the buy to let schemes which have proved so popular over the past decade
7746349 given the current state of the market with the scarcity of mortgages i think that this option could prove to be the perfect product to enable people to get a foothold on the property ladder
7746350 the tenant pays the normal market rent but what they get in addition is a binding option to buy the property for a pre agreed price after a set period of time
7746351 the tenant has to pay an option fee and they get some of the rent they have paid knocked off the price
7746352 they pay the pre agreed price regardless of whether the housing market has risen or fallen back in the intervening time
7746353 effectively this means that everyone is happy the landlord gets his money each month and is able to sell the property the tenant is able to buy the property they want for a price they want to pay
7746354 this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
7746355 the credit crunch while not showing much impact on this years figures has uk law firms worried
7746356 there are precious few deals being done the usually lucrative financial services markets have dried up and the commercial property market has all but stalled
7746357 law firms are beginning to look at one of their costliest overheads their staff and ask questions we have begun to see a trickle of redundancies and more are expected it is costly to have lawyers on six figure salaries sitting there with nothing to do
7746358 the company was facing an uncertain future after the decline in the number of lingerie manufacturers in the uk however we started looking at new export markets and today the plastic parts are regularly sent to central america sri lanka the far east and europe by not being afraid to go global we have managed to keep trenslo as a uk based manufacturer
7746359 we are targeting the affluent towns in the north west because the demographics are right
7746360 strictly come dancing has been a great success and manchesters venue could be among the first to open
7746361 i wanted to get ready for something else but before i could get everything off the floor in the back room the roof caved in on me
7746362 you think youve escaped the rain and it kind of hits you in the face
7746363 i just want it to go away but i guess it will go away when its ready
7746364 a drawn out legal dispute would have led to significant delays to the town centre redevelopment as well as substantial costs to the public purse this way we can re run the process with the minimum delay and with the benefit of knowing the implications of recent case law
7746365 i have been closely involved in many major town centre developer selection competitions over the last few years and without doubt the process followed at rochdale was the most thorough and transparent
7746366 we are delighted that eds has chosen e cycle as its preferred supplier in the provision of services for the management of redundant hardware
7746367 eds and its clients can be assured of a full end of life service which will enable full compliance with current legislation as well as supporting eds in its own sustainability goals
7746368 the relationship between e cycle and eds grows ever stronger and this newly enhanced partnership will signal sustainable employment for hundreds of disabled people in the uk
7746369 it is encouraging to see industry leading organisations like eds take their corporate social responsibility credentials so seriously
7746370 in our capacity as it partners to many of the worlds leading organisations it is important that we not only help our clients manage the costs associated with retiring and disposing of redundant it hardware but also work with partners on which we can depend
7746371 our relationship with e cycle goes back as far as 2004 and they have become a more than trusted partner
7746372 the major equipment refresh programme which we carried out last year with e cycle enabled us to make our biggest ever single donation of pcs to underprivileged african schoolchildren
7746373 i had the idea for the plot sitting in the back of a taxi started writing and kept persevering
7746374 its a nice feeling to see the book in print after the effort and time i put in there was a lot of emotional investment in creating the characters writing the story and doing the research its not going to make me a millionaire but i am proud to have people reading it
7746375 the north west is a significant property region and were delighted to now have a base here with schemes already underway in the region we see a great opportunity to grow the business further in manchester
7746376 the market has always been driven by domestic demand and traditional high street suppliers
7746377 i was always being asked about what products i could recommend what we have done is get together to produce a range of products using new concepts and new materials aimed at athletes
7746378 if the world of sport adopts it it disseminates down to the domestic marketplace everyone who goes to the gym or who cares about their performance knows how vital it is to maximise the quality of their sleep
7746379 administrators turned up out of the blue last friday at vermonts offices in liverpool and by twenty past eleven that morning the bank account had been frozen
7746380 since then the shareholders have been locked in a room with the lawyers looking at various issues and the way forward
7746381 we are doing everything we can to maximise the assets and minimise the liabilities of the business in order to achieve for best possible outcome for all
7746382 we used to buy our raw vegetable oil from oil processors but now that stocks are tight their supply is going to the bigger fuel oil producers and is all but unaffordable to us
7746383 so we decided to employ an oil collector to drive round restaurants and takeaways in greater manchester and collect waste vegetable oil
7746384 oil has been dribbling in from our collector since january but in the last few weeks supplies from local restaurants and takeaways have picked up pace and we re now likely to collect up to 40 000 litres a month
7746385 our production plant which converts the fat into fuel oil can handle 500 000 litres a month which means the chip oil we re collecting only amounts to a day and a halfs production
7746386 it s not a lot but it will keep us going until the world market for vegetable oils calms down
7746387 our appointment by ebay is testament to our strategic approach to programme management in the uk
7746388 supporting the ebay partner network is an incredible opportunity to add value which will be beneficial to both ebay and its affiliates
7746389 r o eye demonstrated that it can combine strong relationships with affiliates with a very flexible approach to programme management
7746390 we were impressed by the agencys in depth knowledge of the affiliate industry as well as its innovative and bold approach to recruitment
7746391 the business began from a spare room at home employing one member of staff and renting one rack of space at a local warehouse we initially had stock to furnish 10 properties
7746392 style counsel interiors now employs 15 members of staff and has 15 000 square feet of warehouse holding stock to complete 250 apartments
7746393 i believe that our success is down to vision focus on excellence and commitment to moving forward with a successful concept to diversify into new markets ensuring the longevity of the business
7746394 we have made it very clear that the business community is divided
7746395 a referendum of local voters will not necessarily gather all the view of business stakeholders as not everyone who runs a business is resident in greater manchester
7746396 businesses must be given the chance to have their say
7746397 to hold an entirely separate referendum for the business community would present a number of difficulties not least in defining the business community and the parameters of the proposed business referendum
7746398 the consultation period is ongoing and as part of this process we are engaging with and listening to the views and opinions of businesses across greater manchester and these will all be carefully considered
7746399 hundreds of thousands of people already know just what a great night out is on offer at belle vue stadium and we hope that this investment will encourage even more members of the business community to come along
7746400 the corporate suite at our stadium in wimbledon in london is consistently between 75 per cent and 80pc occupied and we hope to achieve this for belle vue which at the moment is around 40pc full
7746401 ultimately the price of london land is such that it made the purchase of the venue as a going concern unviable
7746402 my my my its a beautiful world i like swimmin in the sea
7746403 corrupt you corrupt bring corruption to all that you touch
7746404 i have run a few miles i got blisters on my slippered feet

7746413 patrick and i put our heads together and we thought that this rock project would be the best idea
7746414 it means a lot when you have an individual with the type of enthusiasm and ambition that pat does
7746415 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7746416 has been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7746417 i spent 5 1 2 years in a prison cell without i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7746418 i spent those 5 1 2 years not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
7746419 im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with is putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes and thats what i know how to do
7746420 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after every game is the playoffs right now
7746421 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7746422 hes a good dude hes real honest about who he thinks are tough pitchers
7746423 i had a feeling he was sitting on a breaking ball
7746424 even if he sits on it its hard to hit sometimes
7746425 you have to have that feeling of how to pitch
7746426 he was patient he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball
7746427 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
7746428 when he takes the mound hes throwing filthy filthy stuff
7746429 six rbis a couple of homers i think its the right time
7746430 thats probably as good a performance as ive seen against us this year
7746431 whenever they give me the ball im going to take it
7746432 big difference is when the guys pounding the zone throwing strikes
7746433 when i got in i regretted it my hamstrings were tight and my quads hurt
7746434 as a republican i stand before you with deep respect for the history and the traditions of my political party
7746435 but it is clear to all americans that something is a kilter in our great republic in less than a decade americas political and economic standing in the world have been diminished
7746436 the party that once emphasized individual rights has gravitated in recent years toward regulating values
7746437 the party of military responsibility has taken us to war with a country that did not attack us
7746438 will recapture the american dream and be a truly great president
7746439 als berater hat man ja immer eine schlaue meinung ich wollte aber selbst gestalten
7746440 das schlimmste ist sich schlechte deals ins haus zu holen
7746441 ive never heard michelle obama speak before she spoke from her heart
7746442 her job was to help make people feel comfortable with her husband that hes a regular guy and understands their problems and i think she went a long way towards doing that
7746443 you work hard for what you want in life that you word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7746444 put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7746445 in my adult life i am proud of my country because it feels like hope is finally making a comeback
7746446 i love this country and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7746447 the republican strategy is to attack strength michelle is a powerful force republicans will continue to try to find fault with her
7746448 she spoke like every other mother of a working family she grew up the hard way but she is loving caring and soft
7746449 i think people have heard many others say it but they havent heard it from her
7746450 shes got to connect with voters they want to know what kind of person she is to know what kind of mom and wife she is
7746451 she needs to show us a side of obama as it relates to her and her children
7746452 real women relate to the fact that shes genuine and has her own personality
7746453 i think shes going to continue being her strong self because thats what makes her so appealing
7746454 women in this country need somebody to look up to not somebody to tell them how to take care of the kids
7746455 she didnt get through law school by being the softer side of sears
7746456 it is our role to look at uses of the lake front it was inappropriate not to have come before us before decisions made and contracts let
7746457 i held several meetings with representatives from the chicago park district the latin school the gold coast neighbors friends of the park the lincoln park advisory council and the lincoln park conservancy
7746458 im here to preserve the spot for our pets and to to preserve daniel burnham s 100 year old dream
7746459 we walk dogs we play softball there we use the park all the time if you take this park and restrict the use you won t have the ability to share it the space is used for people to watch the air and water show and groups like
7746460 we re a small community park but we have issues eerily similar to yours
7746461 we already know how bad this is what can we do to stop it what is the plan
7746462 as a resident of the 43rd ward and president of the league of women voters of chicago i oppose the construction of the planned soccer field in lincoln park it is a situation where a private institution the latin school of chicago wants control over a portion of public space some acreage of south lincoln park the control is that the land will be designated for what the school wants the construction and design of the playing and seating area advertising and hours of use nighttime activities will necessitate lights this land borders a residential neighborhood was there an impact study on the effect of the increased amount of pedestrian and vehicular traffic residents in near by buildings will look out on advertising bright lights and the stands they will hear crowd and car noises other groups will have less desirable hours available for their use particularly teams with school age children like the scouts the terrain will be covered with astroturf which is supposed to be toxic should children or adults be exposed to this an additional environmental issue is that birds and other small animals will come in contact with it neighbors and visitors from outside the neighborhood will find the area more congested perhaps those who wish to sell their homes a short distance away will find out that their property is lower in value and more difficult to sell this could produce less tax revenue in accordance with the league of women voters position on land use and parks it must be said that this proposed plan goes counter our philosophy that park land be clear of obstacles that parks be well maintained and available to all residents of the city
7746463 wed love to work with you and the latin school to find a better solution a more equitable solution to the recreational needs of the community im sure if we all put our heads together well agree that the south meadow is not the right place weve got to safeguard our precious open spaces there is an abundance of property nearby that could offer a better site
7746464 we sue the city the park district and the latin school
7746465 rejoicing in the good fortune of others is a practice that can help us when we feel emotionally shut down and unable to connect with others rejoicing generates good will the next time you go out in the world you might try this practice directing your attention to people in their cars on the sidewalk talking on their cell phones just wish for them all to be happy and well
7746466 mas aku hampir 15 tahun endak makan ketroprak mas tapi rasanya menurutku tidaklah berubah

7746469 maksud saya melaporkan kejadian itu ke polisi agar dapat menangkap pelaku pencurian tersebut selain itu saya berharap kejadian ini tidak terulang kembali dan cukup saya yang terakhir mengalaminya kasihan kepada masyarakat jika harus mengalami peristiwa yang saya alami ini
7746470 kami juga sudah memperingatkan kepada pasien dan keluarganya agar dapat menjaga dan mengawasi sendiri barang barang miliknya bahkan peringatan itu ditulis dalam kertas dan ditempelkan pada sejumlah dinding di rumah sakit
7746471 theres nothing to do in huntsville the only thing there is a prison
7746472 what do you usually do on a friday night drink hang out with friends go to the movies
7746473 one of the things we were looking at was the economy and how it was going to affect enrollment and also how we were being affected as faculty and staff
7746474 it will help students faculty and staff with some of the economic factors that were going to come into play
7746475 were very hopeful that a lot of students and faculty will use it
7746476 this was our third year for block party and second for the beach bash it was the best its ever been
7746477 were always concerned with trying to select students who are going to be successful
7746478 we found that those students with less than a 2 0 were not making it
7746479 we dont want to take the students money if theyre not going to be successful
7746480 if they are coming in with less than a 2 0 we feel they need to demonstrate that they can be successful first
7746481 we really saw the most dramatic change when we eliminated the top quarter automatic acceptance
7746482 i believe our universitys image comes more from our grad students and the entrance requirements for freshmen scores
7746483 if you have a student in class who is not ready for a senior college it really drags you down
7746484 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7746485 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7746486 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7746487 that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7746488 there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad
7746489 we cant neglect our sons by giving an open immunity for anyone whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
7746490 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7746491 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7746492 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7746493 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7746494 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7746495 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7746496 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7746515 mr gore senator obama is on the line and would really like to speak with you
7746516 the american enterprise can appear anachronistic at a time when countries are shedding fractious provinces or breaking into pieces entirely but it still represents a profoundly civilized goal to overcome ethnic and religious differences in uniting people willingly into one country
7746517 casual dining nationally has just gotten slammed with sales down 5 to 10 percent per store
7746518 fast casual has done really well with sales up 3 to 5 percent
7746519 there is a craving for this type of product take out has done really well since people are looking for convenience and better quality food they dont have to prepare
7746520 we are perceived as a good value and michigan has a lot of our customer base middle class with good incomes

7746523 there are more slaves in the world today than at any time in history
7746524 human beings forced to work under threat of violence for no pay
7746525 there are more slaves in the world today than at any time in history
7746526 this type of abuse is insidious as it preys upon those who are vulnerable due to their immigration status and unfamiliarity with this countrys legal system
7746527 turns the spotlight on the nefarious business practices of the government funded billion dollar planned parenthood empire
7746528 well we have two oil men in the white house it must be their fault
7746529 do you have any views on ethics my views on ethics are based on common sense not dogma i have always been fascinated by the continuing discussion of when human life begins no one seems to mention that life began billions of years ago and has been going strong ever since i sympathize with the need to treat animals in experiments in the most humane way but this is a matter that really does not arise in my own work in fact when i cut up and make grafts on slime mold slugs i do not think of myself as torturing them a sort of slime mold doctor moreau but maybe i am underestimating their sensibilities
7746530 do you have a favorite paper yes g p bidder the relation of the form of a sponge to its currents quart j micr sci 67 293 323 1923 not only did bidder do some ingenious experiments on sponge hydrodynamics but he wrote them up in an exemplary fashion he wrote the paper in a way that alas would no longer be possible in a journal today
7746531 late late nite fdl pirate dnc radio two bits of change
7746532 we get such a kick out of seeing the work and effort that locals put in
7746533 lady do you have any idea how many kids we have in here every day buying games do you think we have the time to look at each and every purchase
7746534 any failure rate is problematic but the failure rate were seeing is downright pathetic
7746535 similar to age restrictions on alcohol tobacco pornography and other products that are potentially harmful to children parents deserve a reasonable expectation that age restrictions for adult entertainment products will be enforced at the retail level
7746536 it is outrageous that retailers are not exercising greater responsibility and even more absurd that there are no meaningful consequences for those retailers who ignore their industrys own age restriction policies
7746537 countless independent studies confirm that repeated exposure to graphic sexual violent and profanity laced video games has a harmful and long term effect on children
7746538 it is high time for retailers to follow the video game industry guidelines and check ids so that children will not be able to purchase m rated video games
7746539 perhaps the retailers felt the pressure was off after the ftcs report was published but frankly either rate of failure is wholly unacceptable
7746540 we encourage concerned citizens to contact their congressional representatives to ensure that the video game industry will become more responsible
7746541 americas children need to be protected from harmful exposure to these products and parents should be able to rely on the industrys promises
7746542 it is clear that the inerrancy debate is settled among the sbc pastors we surveyed they all believe in inspiration with a very small percent not also affirming inerrancy this is a remarkably high number
7746543 in the southern baptist convention the battle for the bible is over and won
7746544 the numbers remind us that we still have work to do
7746545 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error
7746546 the bible is the written word of god and is totally accurate in all that it teaches
7746547 the bible is the authoritative source of truth and wisdom for daily living
7746548 pastor my husband had a heart attack last night and we took him to the hospital but he was dead on arrival i cant believe it has happened but we need your help i know he was not a church member but we would like for you to preach his funeral
7746549 know i am at peace with complete certainty i believe dad is standing watch prepared to guide me into the light
7746550 i always do what nana franscesa my great grandmother taught me to do when grieving light candles say prayers cook a meal for friends buy some flowers if i can find them fresh set up an altar wish the person well on their way home
7746551 deborah i hope you get there with ease and peace im sorry your way out of this world was so rocky that you were not treated with the grace and graciousness that every human being deserves
7746552 im praying that franscesa or someone very like her is there to greet you with a meal some flowers and some sweetness on the other side
7746553 it is clear that the inerrancy debate is settled among the sbc pastors we surveyed they all believe in inspiration with a very small percent not also affirming inerrancy this is a remarkably high number
7746554 in the southern baptist convention the battle for the bible is over and won
7746555 the numbers remind us that we still have work to do
7746556 yes we have settled the issue of the authority of scripture in our confession that battle is over and done however i believe that the battle for the authority and sufficiency of gods word is never really done it is as old as the garden of eden and will continue until jesus comes back as we can see southern baptists pastors are overwhelmingly inerrantists but they are also discerning enough to know that we must always be on guard against compromise and error
7746557 the bible is the written word of god and is totally accurate in all that it teaches
7746558 the bible is the authoritative source of truth and wisdom for daily living
7746559 while southern baptist pastors are united in their view of the inerrancy of scripture they must be aware that 1 out of 4 people who attend their churches each month consider the bible less than totally accurate or authoritative
7746560 d ont worry about your life what you will eat or about the body what you will wear can any of you add a cubit to his height by worrying if then youre not able to do even a little thing why worry about the rest
7746561 trust in the lord with all your heart and do not rely on your own understanding
7746562 think about him in all your ways and he will guide you on the right paths
7746563 but daniel works for a grocery wholesaler and the company let us have all of the damaged goods in this weeks shipment
7746564 i didnt know what to get you for your birthday so i bought you groceries i hope you dont mind
7746565 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
7746566 but god proves his own love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us
7746567 for by grace you are saved through faith and this is not from yourselves it is gods gift not from works so that no one can boast
7746568 if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
7746569 theres a lotta biz buzz back in hollyweird about you guys
7746570 no need to actually stop and think before the joke hits
7746571 just gross em out and make sure somebody drops trou give us crude sexual allusions and raw references to genitalia oh and we need an obnoxious drunken will ferrell like lummox at center stage thats comedy boys thats what makes a real knee slapper
7746572 i have mixed feelings about it but i think on balance its the right thing to do i think its the right thing to do for the climate and for new zealands international reputation and even its only a small bit of the right thing to do its still better than the wrong thing
7746573 i never want to pre empt positions that parties may take but he and his party have been very constructively engaged with us for a long period of time around the scheme so we are just carrying on those talks
7746574 i think its a very good package i think it looks after vulnerable consumers
7746575 and get 5 00 off your order sign up for the 5 00 personal plan and you dont pay anything for a month
7746576 to get 5 00 off your order i literally just launched everything tonight and i want wickedfire to be my testing grounds for a while before i start advertising
7746577 i knew zensix didnt officially offer phone support but after making a request via e mail i heard from someone within 12 hours
7746578 the man who has been forgotten in these modern times of fast fashion and disco trends
7746579 sometimes the first duty of intelligent men is the restatement of the obvious
7746580 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function
7746581 in a series of e mails i patiently explained that bush couldnt be hitler since hitler was dead
7746582 when my grandfather left europe in 1937 the graffiti on the walls read jews go to palestine today the graffiti reads jews out of palestine how soon europe forgets
7746583 come move this transmission so i can take a bath
7746584 ok but i should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf
7746585 well in that case ill just look the other way
7746586 sir i dont understand why did they applaud for me just because i went to the restroom
7746587 every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue the lights go out now how about that drink
7746588 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

7746597 there would be a high priority of the basic rights of the working people of our country not just the super rich
7746598 if were unable to secure sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres little option for boeing other than not to submit a bid
7746599 boeings real point here is that the government has changed its requirements for a tanker so the company needs more time to modify its proposal
7746600 by putting it the way they have they have set it up for a formal protest after all why would the company want to spend millions of dollars on ads and lawyers and question their customers decision if they just intended to drop out
7746601 a new administration wont change anything because procurement rules are rules
7746602 we are told that barack obama believes too much in an america of high principle and high endeavor
7746603 but when john kennedy thought of going to the moon he didnt say its too far to get there we shouldnt even try and today an american flag still marks the surface of the moon
7746604 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7746605 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7746606 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7746607 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7746608 the fact that the line of democrat leadership from kennedy to carter to pelosi were paraded across the stage without the clintons said volumes about what the campaign wanted monday night
7746609 for a year and a half obamas name has been intertwined with clintons tonight the separation was clear and purposeful
7746610 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7746611 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7746612 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7746613 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7746614 this is one of those great moments in political history
7746615 you know there is nothing quite like the kennedy name to light up any democratic gathering it was a moment that these delegates will never forget
7746616 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7746617 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7746618 i think this happens to even the best hitters you have to keep working to get better
7746619 its just that i dont feel comfortable because when i do ill hit whatever they throw i know all be fine and theyve been throwing me good pitches to hit i just miss them its me nothing else
7746620 commemorating the people places and events that have shaped our heritage and history from 1858 to 2008 and beyond this is the story of nab and 150 years in our community
7746621 600 amish contractors or subcontractors work in at least a dozen states
7746622 specialize in the timber frame construction method that doesnt use nails
7746623 they often can erect a house faster and for less money than traditional contractors customers say
7746624 2 200 square foot house using wooden pegs in less than a month
7746625 would have cost at least a third more and taken twice as long if he had used regular contractors
7746626 amish builders tend to do all the construction themselves that cuts out the middlemen and allows them to immediately correct any problems on a job
7746627 theres no question it is harder to get in touch with me says danny schwartz who framed kevins house although some amish framers have websites
7746628 they were there every day regardless of weather and they did exactly what they said they would do and more
7746629 there are good and bad contractors it is more based on what someone is willing to pay than on whether the contractor is amish or not
7746630 its an upscale supermarket that also happens to be kosher
7746631 is positioning itself as a grocery store for observant brooklyn jews
7746632 including an entire freezer case filled with gefilte fish variations
7746633 hard to find items panko for example specialty produce fresh kumquats
7746634 a vast and competitively priced appetizing section and extensive takeout counter the takeout menu will include predictable items like barbecue chicken and coleslaw as well as unusual fare including sushi burekas and salmon roulade with sun dried tomatoes
7746635 customers want the convenience of one stop shopping in an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere and they want a large selection of high quality food items
7746636 they are more careful about what type of food is provided especially the meat and the vegetables and the dairy
7746637 orthodox families are larger on average than secular families and spend twice as much on groceries about 15 000 a year
7746638 and its a flip of the coin if its going to come together
7746639 were talking to all of them to come up with the best spot
7746640 one of them said i was his favorite player i almost fell over
7746641 we are very proud to have entered into this agreement with spacelabs healthcare it demonstrates our ability to further broaden our already existing strong portfolio of leading global oem partners as our partner spacelabs will support the oridion mission to increase patient safety and improve patient outcomes by employing our world class microstream co2 measurement solutions within their systems
7746642 spacelabs is very excited to have the advanced microstream co2 measurement technology from oridion integrated into our new patient monitoring system
7746643 privatisation is not the solution for the problem but considering the quality the private sector can provide efficiency is expected to improve
7746644 but i feel starting up a small scale industry will not be much of a problem
7746645 there are many businesses we can do out of waste
7746646 the project introduces young scholars to careers with nasa and the space program encouraging research and testing of serious scientific and engineering ideas
7746647 that was pretty cool for us to have three teams represented
7746648 its the closest thing to outer space for zero gravity simulation
7746649 the microgravity environment is very foreign and hard to maneuver in
7746650 this year we designed from what we learned and had a very successful flight
7746651 its a great feeling getting to know engineers and scientists and people who work for nasa
7746652 farmers were offered one price and paid another at the godowns after sorting the apples
7746653 farmers were warned of lower prices at the yard by buyers who said that they would gang up and bid low at the auction
7746654 but were expecting more as the quality is good in the past good quality apples fetched us from nu 700 to nu 1 000 a box
7746655 were here only to facilitate the farmers who bring their produce to the auction yard and what happens outside is not under our authority
7746656 usually during apple season our parking is full of trucks but this time not even a single lorry with apples has entered the yard
7746657 ziggurat communities can be almost totally self sufficient energy wise apart from using steam power in the building we will also employ wind turbine technology to harness natural energy resources
7746658 as a general reaction the ziggurat project is viable from a technical point of view however reflecting from a more sustainable holistic approach we do wonder if the food supply and waste system are taken care for as the concept seems rather based upon carbon neutrality and energy saving
7746659 after thoroughly cleaning the dirty wound more than 20 stitches had to be made
7746660 the bear was already in the field eating maize and on seeing aita it attacked him
7746661 we didnt have sufficient money and everything was expensive in thimphu
7746662 its been eight months now and weve been warned to pay the house rent soon or else we might have to leave the place again
7746663 we dont have reliable relatives and we have no option but to stay in the capital
7746664 the dogs escaped by climbing over the chain link mesh but weve attached bamboo mats on meshed wires to prevent the dogs from escaping again
7746665 when i open the door to feed the dogs some escape
7746666 he is desperate to go on a ride called the wild mouth which is a rollercoaster that sings about everywhere hes very brave because even im not going to go on that
7746667 hes also looking forward to watching the sea lions and seeing the parrots he can only manage about an hour at a time but thats enough
7746668 were all just looking forward to getting away for a few days and relaxing its a welcome break
7746669 there are serious issues that have been accumulating including ethnic problems in tibet and xinjiang as well as social issues and conflicts that have been temporarily covered up by force to guarantee a successful olympics
7746670 i cannot predict whether there will be an immediate outbreak of all these problems after the olympics but there will be an outbreak if the government does not take steps to tackle the domestic problems
7746671 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again
7746672 this has nothing to do with the legitimacy of the communist party or debates about political systems
7746673 where did you find that delightful bedspread and matching picture frame
7746674 what the public does not say is that women inherently lack what it takes to be leaders
7746675 to the contrary on seven of eight leadership traits measured in this survey the public rates women either better than or equal to men
7746676 this launch springboards dominos into the lunch business by providing a product that is high quality priced right and aimed at convenience minded people without a lot of time
7746677 we have high end ovens in our stores that cost 30 000 and bake our sandwiches at 450 degrees it gives us a huge quality advantage competitors cant match
7746678 people fed up with brown bagging or driving to pick up something cold can save some time and gas by ordering a hot dominos sandwich for delivery to their home or office
7746679 at least 16 iraqis were killed and 14 more were wounded in the latest round of violence one u s soldier was killed in a small arms attack in baghdad
7746680 life in iraq is still hard despite the slight improvement in security there is a big deficiency in services in all areas and even in the nice neighborhoods this deficiency is the fault of the government and concerned circles which cannot fulfill their duties because of endemic fraud
7746681 why are they the one who is feeding me are they giving me allowance and so what is their concern
7746682 we lifted the recycle bins because people thought that it was a garbage bin and continued to dump everything together
7746683 for this to work we need to tie up with good scrap dealers and were seriously working on it
7746684 waste management is not the problem but waste reduction is
7746685 were already outpacing 2007 so i think were going to see significant growth
7746686 when you shop at the grocery store its very limited they dont have a very wide selection i think if we had a farmers market i think we would shop more and eat more produce
7746687 the spirit of the league was community family well being nurturing
7746688 set your mind on things above not on things on the earth
7746689 the truth is im just bitter that clinton didnt get the nomination once again the black man has got something before any woman did sexism is alive and well in this country
7746690 im going to change my affiliation from democrat to independent until i decide
7746691 there will be people who leave this convention saying they will vote for mccain and thats what the media is going to focus on
7746692 but the majority is putting aside the personalities of this convention and well focus on winning the election
7746693 to not honour the 18 million people who voted for clinton in the democratic nominating contests would be a disservice
7746694 but then i will work very hard for senator obama and we will elect a democratic president
7746695 there was bound to be some lingering feelings after such a tough primary and news that she was not vetted for the vp position
7746696 i think they will support obama in the end its still early and there is no real consequence to saying they are supporting mccain as the stakes get higher and the election approaches well see more of a switch to obama
7746697 the ball is in her court shes the only one who can convince them
7746698 i know im cutting off my nose to spite my face but i want mccain to win
7746699 that way hillary can have another chance at the presidency in 2012
7746700 all in all then modularity seems a powerful and elegant solution to the problem of coordinating the intellectual division of labor no less a figure than linus torvalds has testified to the value of modularity in the arena of opensource software
7746701 with the linux kernel it became clear very quickly that we want to have a system that is as modular as possible
7746702 as the community of open source software developers clearly understands openness does not mean only unfettered access to knowledge of the visible design rules of the system though that may be a necessary condition rather openness is about the right to take advantage of those design rules more broadly the degree of openness of a modular system is bound up with the overall assignment of decision rights within the intellectual division of labor this is an organizational issue and what may be the same thing a constitutional issue
7746703 one is by moving the knowledge to those with the decision rights the other is by moving the decision rights to those with the knowledge
7746704 hybrid models are actually far more typical of opensource software development than are genuinely voluntary or spontaneous ones indeed perhaps all models of open source software development are hybrid models
7746705 i feel like i had been putting the wrong fuel in a car for years and now im finally using the right one im on the mend not broken
7746706 the only hope is that consumers read the list of ingredients and spot the colourings flavourings and stabilisers

7746714 weve come with hopes to make money so that our children and our parents back home could have better lives
7746715 weve been working on such roads for years and knowing the risk we advise the travelers but most of them pass harsh remarks and ignore our guidance

7746722 after conducting an exhaustive national search for a spokesperson the air guard decided that laura was the ideal fit
7746723 we went into the studio with this wonderful song submitted a demo and the air guard loved it with their campaign set to hit next month it made sense for us to include hometown heroes on the cd and release it as lauras new single were absolutely thrilled to be a part of this great effort
7746724 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

7746748 i know some of the services are a strait up scam
7746749 what if you donate your body but do not have a service

7746751 now in its second decade as perhaps the most significant awards from for new distinguished buildings in the united states the chicago athenaeum museum of architecture and design and metropolitan arts press ltd
7746752 the wide geographic distribution of these awards attests to the importance of the program
7746753 there is no one single program that brings together the latest cutting edge international architecture today as one cohesive universal representation or platform for american design our museum is honored to provide a focus that allows an exploration and analysis for current stylistic directions and philosophical thinking that is apparent in contemporary design today
7746754 the program has a unique educational mission and public profile with the intent of promoting and celebrating the latest most cutting edge international design to a national and international audience

7746763 young women who were exposed to a number of life events should be considered as a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
7746764 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one meaningful life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women
7746765 on the other hand general feelings of happiness and optimism can play a protective role against the disease
7746766 but well be looking as we always do to use the turnover figures and redeployment wherever we can to minimise the head count impact
7746767 were targeting good efficiencies but were arent doing that by quoting numbers of head count

7746770 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
7746771 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7746772 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7746773 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
7746774 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
7746775 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
7746776 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7746777 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the centre of my world
7746778 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them
7746779 men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms
7746780 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7746781 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7746782 and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7746783 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country

7746785 i jumped over two levels advanced rookie and low a
7746786 its exciting and i got my first start at first i was surprised to get the start i just pitched my game and that was the best defense playing behind me ever all the plays they made looked routine when they other team hit ground balls off me they were harder than in the rookie league and the guys made the plays for me i had to adjust mentally i was fine because i had done this before but physically it was different
7746787 in the past few weeks i was throwing only one or two innings when id go out there so this was definitely different i just made sure i loosened up
7746788 donald really picked up his game and really played great toward end of the match
7746789 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7746790 the toughest thing for me is to keep the ball down more consistently
7746791 its not a maybe thing youve got to do it ive got to work on that because its killing me
7746792 even though weve got manny were not gonna beat peoples brains out
7746793 were not gonna go out there and outscore people in high scoring games very much
7746794 ive said i had the confidence to beat him for a long time but havent actually done it its a little different to go out there and do it
7746795 this is the first time ive had that win on my record and to come in and feel like i have the confidence to be that top player
7746796 every year i feel like i can come in here and win this tournament but in the past roger was dominating and making it look easy
7746797 id say there are seven or eight guys that have a chance to win it rafael nadal is the favorite but i wouldnt say a clear cut favorite like the way roger federer was
7746798 i have a lot of work to do before i get to some of those top guys
7746799 a regular run of the mill middle class american family
7746800 the problem is playing toronto cincinnati and beijing then coming back here in two weeks two times 12 hours jet lag
7746801 im a little bit more tired than i usually am but at the same time i must be very happy how i did this year
7746802 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7746803 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because my mind is still there
7746804 after tims letter in 1992 i regarded my adult son as a victim
7746805 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7746806 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7746807 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7746808 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner
7746809 he is a very skilled player a very hard thrower
7746810 there are a lot of beginners this is not a high powered league this is a developmental league whose main purpose is to promote the sport
7746811 i have never seen behavior of a parent like the behavior jerichos mother exhibited wednesday night
7746812 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7746813 a major reason that obamas rhetoric seems to soar so high is that our expectations have sunk so low
7746814 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
7746815 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
7746816 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
7746817 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
7746818 so how come at freshmen orientation they taught us about petty worries like stds and alcohol but not how to survive real peril namely earthquakes

7746822 illusion that danger may be abolished through successful diplomatic negotiations or by achieving a balance of armed forces
7746823 the split is a much profounder and more alienating one
7746824 thus we already have three worlds undoubtedly however the number is even greater we are just too far away to see
7746825 vast regions everywhere on our planet should develop and mature to the level of present day western systems
7746826 may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civic courage
7746827 technical and social progress has permitted the realization of such aspirations the majority of people have been granted well being to an extent their fathers and grandfathers could not even dream about an almost unlimited freedom of enjoyment
7746828 is only a question of the good organization of the state the problem of organizing a state however hard it may seem can be solved even for a race of devils
7746829 ambition must be made to counteract ambition the interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place
7746830 policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests the defect of better motives
7746831 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
7746832 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
7746833 tilt of freedom in the direction of evil has come about gradually it was evidently born primarily out of a humanistic and benevolent concept according to which there is no evil inherent in human nature the world belongs to mankind and all the defects of life are caused by wrong social systems which must be corrected
7746834 everything beyond physical well being and accumulation of material goods all other human requirements and characteristics of a subtler and higher nature are left outside the range of attention of the state and the social system
7746835 the very basis of human thinking in the past centuries
7746836 rationalistic humanism or humanistic autonomy the proclaimed and enforced autonomy of man from any higher force above him
7746837 we are now experiencing the consequences of mistakes which had not been noticed at the beginning of the journey
7746838 on the way from the renaissance to our days we have enriched our experience but he have lost the concept of a supreme compete entity which used to restrain our passions and our irresponsibility
7746839 the split in the world is less terrible than the fact that the same disease plagues its two main sections
7746840 it is imperative to review the table of widespread human values
7746841 intolerable despotic repression of mans physical nature in favor of the spiritual one
7746842 we shall have to rise to a new height of vision to a new level of life where our physical nature will not be cursed as in the middle ages but even more importantly our spiritual being will not be trampled upon as in the modern era
7746843 just because i am a friend to i dare to say these things about democracy
7746844 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7746845 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7746846 a major reason that obamas rhetoric seems to soar so high is that our expectations have sunk so low
7746847 personally i guess the growth in internet penetration is one of the main reasons behind the growth in laptop sales the number of internet users in the arab world is in a continues growth for instance social networking users in arabia and africa grew up by 66 in 2008 so were are talking about millions of arabs are on social networking sites not to mention other internet services more reasons to be online
7746848 these units getting turned around is making a big difference
7746849 this is one of the most complex projects the state has ever done
7746850 it is very difficult to get a fire marshal to bless just portions of even a new building
7746851 at the end of the day its the fire marshal we have to deal with
7746852 right now we are hoping that the whole southeast section of the union will come online together
7746853 i have no knowledge of the grass being cut by the city
7746854 half of louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment

7746856 when buying and selling are controlled by legislation the first things to be bought and sold are legislators
7746857 one of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors
7746858 was aware of all of the factors that were going to happen in that part of campus
7746859 with the right concept and one students are really interested in it could work
7746860 a 40 acre parcel these days brings roughly around 100 000
7746861 ive seen some go as high as around 130 000 for around here the more wooded the better
7746862 even though theres so much public hunting land in the area theres a certain group of people some of which already have lake homes up in the area they want to have their own most of the people that are buying it are from the twin cities market
7746863 you start breaking apart farms by selling off chunks here and chunks there and then those probably will never have the capacity of going back into ag production
7746864 i think that fragmentation is the biggest issue that i see
7746865 as that acreage comes out well it changes the dynamics
7746866 the equipment dealers leave and the local elevators and feed stores and the communities lose their identity a little bit
7746867 if you go back to the 70s and 80s and we had strong value we had strong commodity prices then in the mid 80s the late 80s you had the bust im not going to be a doomsdayer but i anticipate that someday theres going to be a downturn again
7746868 into the future more and more competing pressure in some of the transition areas in the state maybe perhaps north central minnesota some of the areas surrounding urban areas where theres competing uses that land may be used for something other than agriculture
7746869 we may continue to see a lot of increases in the farmland values in some of those areas

7746881 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs the spokesman said
7746882 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investments such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck he said
7746883 that re emphasised our commitment to australia and that it is an ongoing commitment insurance
7746884 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum

7746901 i dont think she has decided exactly how shes going to do it or what shes going to do other than have a keen interest in figuring how we can use new media to extend our reach and make sure people who may not be seeing the evening news get a chance to see the work she is doing in a new form and in a new way
7746902 is something that katies really interested in and so are we

7746909 what we are seeing today is an almost continuing talent show
7746910 thinking about e learning in new ways has to start with existing paradigms that might be holding you back calling people what they really are is a good beginning but if you must use a generic term a better one might be performer 23
7746911 i dont know of any other australian universities who have set up a staff blog system like this
7746912 i think its working because i dont domesticate it too much
7746913 obviously were writing for a fairly specific audience and it is under the university name
7746914 already it may no longer be accurate to think of the blog as a single genre
7746915 both a habit and a habitat the conceptual habitat within which individuals perceive and experience a particular environment as well as the rhetorical habit by a through which they function within that environment
7746916 writing takes place it takes place socially and rhetorically to write is to position oneself within genres to assume and enact certain situated commitments identities relations and practices
7746917 coordinate a symbiotic relationship between social habitats and rhetorical habitats
7746918 at this point its clear that theres more than enough going on in dryden for stories every day there is an incredible amount happening here and only a fraction of it can make the paper
7746919 objective locational dimension people can look for a place find it move within it
7746920 semantic dimension it means something important to a person or group of people and this latter dimension may or may not be communicable to others

7746927 this is just yet another grab at increasing their 80 per cent market domination in the supermarket sector and itll be at the expense if it gets through of independent retailers who are serving consumers on the coast and indeed consumers who will have less choice when competitions destroyed
7746928 there may be some small residual impact but generally speaking it would be very unlikely
7746929 freedom of speech redefined by blogs words travel faster stay around longer in the blogosphere
7746930 in another generation these students would have simply been users of a computer
7746931 someday theyll be in a job applicant pool and a potential employer will run their name through google and the angry ranting web log they wrote at age 17 will turn up
7746932 its a substantial change in how we engage in discourse especially in this country
7746933 as such i think universities have a duty in some ways to provide students with the tools they need to better participate in that discourse

7746953 we had just built this centre and we were still trying to commission everything else when we get the email through from dylans production company that he wants a leather reclining chair
7746954 so we went up to waters department store at the time and asked them to lend us a jade green leather chair for bob and put it in his dressing room
7746955 as it turned out bob was being stalked at the time by somebody so there was a high level of security backstage so he came in about five minutes before going on stage and probably spent about 30 seconds on this leather reclining chair
7746956 then he went on stage came straight off stage and was up mt ousley before the applause had even ended
7746957 were a little more multiple than we have been the past couple of years on defense
7746958 but the foundation will be out of a three man front type of thing and the utilization of some bigger outside linebackers gives us an opportunity to be a little more flexible
7746959 in particular i think of david akinniyi hes 6 foot 4 and 245 plus pounds when he rushes he rushes like hes a defensive end and when hes on pass drops he covers an awful lot of ground so hes a pretty versatile and very useful person in our defensive scheme

7746976 but they know that in order for hillary to be effective in the future we need a democratic white house and they are ready to lay down whatever they need to move on and fight for that
7746977 were really really passionate about the chance to see the first woman ever in the white house
7746978 know they have to put that aside and keep working for that someday in the future they know that everything they care about as democrats is at stake in this election and they are ready to go to work for it
7746979 i have worked with senator obama i know he is going to be just a great president

7746988 then you realize you dont have any pictures any more you realize im cold and i have no clothes i have nothing left

7746999 davis county commissioner alan hansen found himself kissing a 3 year old sand colored horse named reno after a contest between davis county and the davis hospital medical center over who could lose the most weight
7747000 members of the team that shed the most pounds got to watch their boss kiss a farm animal this year the county employees won losing 397 6 pounds just slightly trimmer than the hospital workers
7747001 hansen was not around when his fellow commissioners locked lips with a cow over the weekend but met up with reno on the front steps of the county courthouse for a quick smooch
7747002 but not before he slathered on some lip balm and popped a breath mint
7747003 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
7747004 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7747005 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here thats our ultimate goal
7747006 we need to get people here to see what can be accomplished when the best minds are put to a task
7747007 i stand before you with great pride this is a historic moment in american political life historic for myself for my people for all women for the first time in the history of this nation a political party has chosen a negro woman for the second highest office in the land
7747008 for it is the call of all my people and the call to my people frederick douglass would rejoice for he fought not only slavery but the oppression of women above all douglass would counsel us not to falter
7747009 we definitely had the most animosity from democrats the obama supporters would almost never sign our petitions
7747010 any time there are a lot of names on a ballot of course you will have some people who will support another candidate but people are so used to seeing naders name on the ballot they dont pay attention to it
7747011 we wanted to be able to vote for a candidate that represented us and felt the same way we did about the issues
7747012 wants to pull all of the troops out of iraq he wants single payer health care so it would actually be real universal health care and hes very opposed to nuclear power we dont want nuclear power or uranium enrichment coming into idaho

7747017 i think its what people expected its going to be a tight race
7747018 her people have to be deeply worried by these returns
7747019 we said all along that we had a lot of work to do and that we werent taking anything for granted
7747020 were still viewing it like that we havent changed our game plan
7747021 the obama wave is also there and were confident that that will have an impact in this state
7747022 for months democrats have tried to say this race wont be close
7747023 the polls have been saying otherwise the primary results just confirmed that its dead even again
7747024 youre going to have a ton of young voters who will come out and vote for obama and no one else on the ticket
7747025 even though nationally it looks like this going to be a very strong democratic year both rossi and mccain seem like theyd be able to overtake those national odds for whatever reason
7747026 that doesnt mean theyll win but both of them are quite competitive in a year when their party has a lot of disadvantages
7747027 what we learned in 2004 is that every vote really does matter
7747028 i do not see any improvement in these issues for at least a year
7747029 i would solve a lot of literary problems just thinking about a character in the subway where you cant do anything anyway
7747030 i love roller coasters so this is my ultimate birthday
7747031 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7747032 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7747033 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the colorado
7747034 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7747035 the wind is so strong were literally just watching houses go up in flames
7747036 first youre happy youre all safe then you realize you dont have any pictures anymore

7747082 because of all the other things on the agenda i expect to devote only an hour or two to the chelsea project
7747083 if you are criticising you are not being grateful if you are blaming you are not being grateful if you are complaining you are not being grateful
7747084 because the field you are talking about is new age self help and theres a lot of nonsense involved in it a lot of it
7747085 im not aware of any of these things im not involved
7747086 she started saying im the creative person and theyre my ideas therefore i should be getting more of the profit

7747088 certainly there is karma out there and its working big time
7747089 the greatest success story in the annals of viral marketing
7747090 rhonda actually insisted that we not have a contract she said they limited peoples freedom that theyre designed to guard against things going wrong which is not the way of the secret because it is focusing on the negative
7747091 thats when i started to think this doesnt feel right
7747092 but by the same token my company and rhondas had worked together for several years so i had come to trust her she said we were going to share the abundance
7747093 plus a share of 10 per cent of gross margins of all revenues from the secret website
7747094 i had seen the trailer and it was remarkably well done
7747095 i said holy cow i dont know what this is but it looks like its going to be good
7747096 money was flowing in incredibly well during that first month and i fully expected that as agreed id get paid the monthly percentage of revenues from the site from that point on

7747102 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7747103 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7747104 for catechins the class of antioxidants under examination and among the most potent dietary antioxidants only between 0 1 and 1 1 per cent of the amount consumed makes it into our blood if we can improve that rate the benefits are enormous

7747110 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7747111 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama and he responded in the affirmative
7747112 such massive galaxy clusters are thought to be rare objects in the distant universe they can be used to test cosmological theories
7747113 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7747114 as i walked toward my room i noticed that the door was opened with the security bolt blocking the complete closing of the door
7747115 what the hell are you doing are you putting a bug on my phone
7747116 how many hotel rooms have i been in the past four years it was so obvious
7747117 have there been any other episodes that would make you believe this kind of action is being taken against you
7747118 not since ive been running for congress but there were several times when i was in crawford or protesting in d
7747119 i believe the momentum is definitely on our side especially the last couple weeks with our signature drive
7747120 it isnt just about my being speaker of the house and hillary clinton going for something bigger the presidency of the united states
7747121 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7747122 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7747123 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7747124 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7747125 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7747126 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7747127 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7747128 if were in nato we wont have to worry about nato attacking romania over our relations with our hungarian minority the way you attacked yugoslavia
7747129 since turkey has been in nato for decades you let them do what they want with the kurdish minority
7747130 if thats why you want to get into nato ill make sure you never do
7747131 whats that guy so upset about he looks the way i felt when i chaired my last judiciary committee meeting
7747132 hes got some big problem on his mind do you know what it is
7747133 we recently concentrated on u s and uk primarily because we see value
7747134 its here after all my hard work come and get it
7747135 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7747136 all the major leads including the 25 basis points hike have been priced in that is why your rates are trapped in a range
7747137 i went there i sat in the borders i went in those camps theyre going to have thousands and thousands and thousands of people die weve got to stop talking and act
7747138 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant events to occur in europe since the end of communism
7747139 the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region
7747140 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing
7747141 and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
7747142 a new energy policy to freeze ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil
7747143 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7747144 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama and he responded in the affirmative
7747145 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7747146 these animals were actually dying but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7747147 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7747148 meaney all off season has been talking about how this should be his year because hes got just about everybody back from last years team
7747149 i think the top tier of the conference are all good teams
7747150 right now id put us in the bottom of that top tier and by the end of the year i hope well be in the top i think weve got to prove ourselves
7747151 but i would be remiss if i didnt think we werent going to be in the hunt for a conference championship
7747152 hes a tremendous guy and competitor believe me we understand what we have
7747153 sheets has put together a good season but his history of injuries makes it tough to commit that kind of money to
7747154 therell be a controversial call and people will start saying we have the technology so why dont we use it for other things then pressure will mount on the higher ups and theyll succumb to the public pressure and start using it for everything
7747155 we cant worry about whether the games are home or away
7747156 were in the part of the season where we have to win series doesnt matter where we do it or how we do it
7747157 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7747158 were trying to stay a little bit underneath the radar whatever you want to call it about not trying to talk too big and hopefully let our play do whatever talking needs to be said
7747159 the typical response is they feel very passionate about barack obama one way or the other
7747160 a day of sightseeing tying up loose financial ends at the hotel and saying farewell to friends old and new throughout the day the odyssey that started on the morning of aug 2 at dulles will conclude tuesday around 7 30 p m back at the airport
7747161 to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7747162 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7747163 see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7747164 we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7747165 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7747166 i played for several hours and the battery didnt die overall battery life is longer then wii rechargable controllers
7747167 i bogeyed the last hole and that doesnt leave a good taste in your mouth
7747168 all youre trying to do is score lower than your opponents
7747169 you have to work hard to shoot 71 in this wind
7747170 i had to keep shots under the wind to control the distance
7747171 i was playing some holes with driver and 8 iron where he was hitting driver and 3 wood
7747172 he really worked on his game over the summer and its carried over into the season
7747173 i land it about 15 feet short let it hop twice and spin
7747174 we have lots of people who can shoot in the 70s and have the potential to go low
7747175 i think the west will be as balanced as its ever been
7747176 everybody is going to be able to beat everybody and thats good
7747177 the competition will definitely help us when it comes playoff time
7747178 youve got to keep picking fremd until somebody beats them
7747179 the strength of the program is the kids who sit on the sidelines junior year and how theyve learned to prepare
7747180 i think barrington has the most coming back from returning talent
7747181 fine my name is con jonner and i come from the future
7747182 the darkest in an attempt to bring order to the world the government funded a company to make little robots that would clean on august 4th 1997 one of them became aware
7747183 but first they gave me this two pack of go dusters theyre motorized you see but non sentient they only operate under my control that makes me a cyborg
7747184 im a freak you see a tortured misunderstood freak and yet i can also work on vertical blinds electronics and furniture also theres multi surface spray included
7747185 but mine traps dust on the duster head and thats how i fight skyoomba trying to prevent it from coming to life
7747186 no no curse them im too late theres nothing i can do but try to create the warrior that will through struggle overcome skyoomba and redeem our future hurry i know a cheap motel where we can get started tonight
7747187 but but the future let me embrace you with my go duster two pack arms
7747188 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7747189 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
7747190 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
7747191 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
7747192 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7747193 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7747194 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7747195 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7747196 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7747197 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

7747250 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
7747251 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch everyone is living in fear
7747252 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
7747253 they are a prime target because theyve got money and theyve got a worry and you can combine those two and offer them a false sense of security which is exactly what this is
7747254 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7747255 its my job so ive got to be good at it
7747256 thats how i look at it its not easy but im going to be out here working hard to maintain myself improving and being ready whenever they need me
7747257 but ive got to be ready because that moment could be the biggest moment of my career and ive got to take off and be ready to go
7747258 i was a little surprised but ive had some time to digest it and ill be ready to go
7747259 i will be ready at a moments notice you never know whats going to happen my plan is to stay ready
7747260 my role from everyone elses standpoint has changed and thats taken a little bit of time to get over ill never fully get over it and i dont think anyone would expect me to
7747261 but theres a role for everyone on the football team sometimes you dont like it but as a team player you have to go with it and thats what rex is doing
7747262 i felt like this was a great option for me to come back and start and it didnt happen but the season is just around the corner
7747263 i havent worried about that because i dont control that
7747264 i feel like ive a done a lot for this team over the last five years and ive had some unfortunate things happen to me and some bad games
7747265 but for the most part i feel like i have been a pretty good contributor to this organization and to winning a lot of games
7747266 i dont know how many games ive won but weve won a lot of games when ive played so i am proud of a lot of things ive done and im not paying attention to anyone or anything that will try to tell me otherwise
7747267 im going to make sure i do whatever i need to do to make sure i develop whatever skill i need to make sure im a great player in this league
7747268 my personal goals havent changed my role and the immediate future have changed but my outlook hasnt changed at all
7747269 just make sure you study the film make sure you work out a little bit extra because youre not going to have the same amount of reps

7747273 brazil is growing dynamically and wavecom is well positioned to take significant share in the market for applications including automotive metering alarm systems and point of sale devices
7747274 one of the reasons we are very comfortable doing business with wavecom and will keep doing business with wavecom
7747275 it is a very common problem to get technical support from other vendors because most of the time it is only available in english and not all of our engineers speak english
7747276 we have seen the interest of wavecom in latin america region and we know they know how important it is going to be and how its growing
7747277 it is very good for wavecom to have an office here in brazil
7747278 it will allow wavecom to work more closely with the customer
7747279 we are in a leadership position in many of the local markets in latin america and are confident in the entire regions coming growth
7747280 thats why weve decided to expand our presence there into brazil to better service this rapidly expanding market
7747281 judge no man until you have stood in his shoes
7747282 be responsible for placing the country under such political administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the jewish national home
7747283 our nation is the arabic nation that stretches from the atlantic ocean to the red sea and beyond it
7747284 the palestinian people does not exist the creation of a palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of israel for our arab unity in reality today there is no difference between jordanians palestinians syrians and lebanese only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a palestinian people since arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct palestinian people to oppose zionism for tactical reasons jordan which is a sovereign state with defined borders cannot raise claims to haifa and jaffa while as a palestinian i can undoubtedly demand haifa jaffa beer sheva and jerusalem however the moment we reclaim our right to all of palestine we will not wait even a minute to unite palestine and jordan
7747285 only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of israel
7747286 it would be fitting for us to mention to the responsible israeli authorities that we view palestine not just as an inseparable part of the arab nation but as a part of southern syria
7747287 the appearance of the national palestinian persona serves as a response to israels claim that palestine is jewish
7747288 such a creature as palestine does not exist at all this land is nothing but the southern portion of greater syria
7747289 a means for continuing our struggle against the state of israel for our arab unity
7747290 an additional consideration of great importance for the arab world is racial uniformity the arabs lived in a broad expanse stretching from the mediterranean sea to the indian ocean they spoke one language and shared a common history tradition and aspirations their unity was the solid foundation for peace in one of the most central and sensitive regions in the world for that reason it does not make sense that the united nations should facilitate the establishment of a foreign entity within that well rooted unity
7747291 the palestinian people believes in arab unification it believes that in order to fulfill its task towards achieving this goal it must at this stage of its national struggle preserve all the components of its palestinian personality and it must increase awareness of its existence and reject all plans liable to weaken it or make it disappear
7747292 before 1917 when balfour made his declaration there had never been a palestinian question and there was no palestine as a political or geographic unit
7747293 there is no such land palestine is a term invented by the zionists there is no palestine in the bible our land was for hundreds of years a part of syria
7747294 the name palestine is not a country but a geographic region
7747295 the one and only identity never adopted by the inhabitants of eretz yisrael before 1967 was that of palestinian arab

7747335 the disengagement of israeli policy from its religious fuel is the real disengagement currently on the agenda on the day after the disengagement religious zionisms status will be different the real question is not how many mortar shells will fall or who will guard the philadelphi route connecting gaza with egypt or whether the palestinians will dance of the roofs of ganei tal the real question is who sets the national agenda
7747336 soldiers who experienced the evacuation wont travel to an ashram in india because they discovered that there is an ashram next door the same jewish religion that they hadnt seen up close for a long time embraces them into its fold with a song and a tear for a common fate they have now sat arm in arm at the synagogues in gush katif they have now felt the holiness mixed in sweat they have now moved rhythmically and sung songs they have stood in line to kiss the torah scrolls they are now half inside
7747337 all these rabbis have one thing in common they all see in conversion a sacred commandment as part of their national responsibility in other words the conversion is not primarily the spiritual and religious need of the individual convert who wishes to join the jewish people and accept upon himself all the commandments rather conversion is a means of improving the spiritual situation of the entire jewish nation living in israel it is a way of bringing jews closer to their judaism

7747354 is the israel palestine conflict still the key to peace in the whole region is the linkage policy right
7747355 i dont think its about a linkage policy but a linkage fact without doubt the path to peace in the middle east goes through jerusalem
7747356 the israeli palestinian conflict is the single most combustible and galvanizing issue in the arab world
7747357 the first step in the re creation of the european family
7747358 the problems of the middle east are conflated and certainly the israeli palestinian conflict and iraq are interactive thats absolutely a fundamental truth
7747359 this could be a golden opportunity to begin to change the face of the arab world just as what we did in germany changed the face of central and eastern europe here we have got a golden chance
7747360 sound bites from pollsters and so called experts on arab opinion
7747361 less thoughtful challengers of this truism of linkage set up a straw man when they argue that defusing the palestinian israeli conflict wont magically solve all the regions other problems does anyone serious suggest that it would
7747362 without significant progress toward an israeli palestinian peace post occupation iraq will be both anti american and anti israel
7747363 was americas popularity really so high in the arab and muslim worlds prior to the iraq invasion

7747370 israels clear cut borders faded as the nation once again started mixing with another people
7747371 dismissed or destroyed the evidence of other non jewish settlement including fourteen hundred years of native islam
7747372 the way in which diaspora jews harmful pattern of accommodation to majority power led them to look inward for culpability rather than outward toward their enemies
7747373 how can we as jews treat the palestinians like this after our history of suffering
7747374 so do you hate them because they are jewish or like them because they are like the nazis
7747375 were not celebrating israels anniversary they will not be celebrating israel independence day israel is a state founded on terrorism massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land what the holocaust is to the jews the naqba is to the palestinians we cannot celebrate the birthday of a state founded on terrorism massacres and the dispossession of another people from their land we cannot celebrate the birthday of a state that even now engages in ethnic cleansing that violates international law that is inflicting a monstrous collective punishment on the civilian population of gaza and that continues to deny to palestinians their human rights and national aspirations

7747380 israel is indeed discriminated against by the criticism leveled at it not necessarily because it is a jewish state but rather mainly because it is a western state

7747416 the sponsors are all extremely happy they like lockport its bigger than north tonawanda and the demographic draw is more diverse
7747417 the night reo speedwagon played was our best night since we opened 12 years ago we turned over the dining room four times the take out side was packed it was unbelievable
7747418 the main goal of the series was to showcase our downtown improvements and it worked
7747419 ive met a lot of people from out of town who said lockport looks a lot better than the last time they were here everything was wonderful

7747435 true hollywood lies is an honest look at the absurdities of life in the film industry charming funny emotional with true to hollywood life characters this is a fast paced thoroughly entertaining read that i had a hard time putting down the characters flaws only serve to make them more human drawing the reader into the story ms brown writes with a fresh unique voice and i look forward to reading her next book impossibly tongue tied

7747527 well last week he came into my office again requesting that i draw up another new will in it you were to be included again sybilla was going to be cut out

7747530 i cant even think about that now jasper just too soon

7747546 i dont know jasper i really dont think im cut out for it but thanks for thinking about me
7747547 i understand sweetie believe me i do but the money is decent six thousand a month and it wont be forever just however long it takes for leos estate to be straightened out if anything the hubbub around this kid might help you keep your mind off of it and hes not a bad sort at least not yet anyway you might actually enjoy yourself
7747548 take a day or two to think about it if you change your mind call svetlana in my office and shell email over exactly what you need to know about the job in the meantime ill do my best to keep leos widow at bay

7747570 you dont get it sam its its more than just the dirty talk i mean sure she allows me to to fantasize but also she she actually listens to me shes the only woman who knows the real me without really knowing me sam

7747577 shit man no wonder lucindas pissed not just obsessed youre in love and its not just with a piece of ass its with a voice which is probably attached to a face that might make you scream if you woke up beside it youre about to blow your meal ticket hugo not to mention youre also losing the one woman who will ever love your sorry ass unconditionally hell do you know how lucky you are and need i remind you that i was the one who set you two up in the first place

7747707 young women who were exposed to a number of life events should be considered as a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
7747708 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one meaningful life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women

7747711 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7747712 anytime you got a team like minnesota thats right there and were getting close to september that kind of enhances it
7747713 weve talked about it anytime you can tie or move ahead of the greats that played the game its very humbling its something you look back and feel very honored you cherish that for sure
7747714 its nice to win this one it hard after the first game it gets you down
7747715 thome has been my favorite player since i was old enough to know about him with the indians
7747716 it was good to get him out the two times but i left a mistake right there for him the last one
7747717 our lineup has changed since the lineup was out there so we were looking at the lineup card to see where we were all at unfortunately we didnt pull it out
7747718 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7747719 i looked across the table and there was joey maybe 5 10 5 9
7747720 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7747721 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
7747722 there were other options but i think for the long term and whats in the best interest of jgr the home depot and our whole team joey was the guy
7747723 racing is a lot of little things that make it every time i go to the racetrack i learn things as long as i pick up something every time i go to the racetrack its going to be great
7747724 weve had a great 10 years weve got some pretty good stats to set our goals at right now and to use that as our motivating tools in the future weve got to win at least three next year like we did in 99
7747725 people think im old im not that old yet so hopefully those healing cells are still in there
7747726 i have every reason to believe hes going to be there so my cups half full
7747727 but its only half full because theres a chance he could miss the first one
7747728 to be able to play through those things and show up on sunday is something i take pride in
7747729 so we can just wash that out of our memory
7747730 were going to let them leave it in their mouth as long as they can
7747731 i thought we looked like a bunch of drunken cowpokes trying to do a texas two step with one leg it was ugly
7747732 you cant print what id call it i think maybe its a gut check for us to say maybe we need to start focusing a little more on the details obviously were upset about it but ill tell you one thing i may happen to us once but its not going to happen to us twice we wont allow it buges wont allow it and thats not something were going to make a tradition
7747733 thats something i learned in elementary school way back when tight hands win and i didnt do that on that one particular play and he took advantage of it
7747734 thats the story of my life as an offensive lineman
7747735 you can block a guy 55 times out there but that 56th time if he gets by and gets a sack he had a great game and you didnt its as simple as that
7747736 this has been a mess for decades but its time to fix it
7747737 and that is the first thing the new president will face
7747738 its up to us working with our new president to put some sense into the whole framework of the law so it works for america
7747739 whats happening is a moral outrage and its a policy debacle
7747740 this is about whether we as americans are going to include people or exclude people
7747741 some of the statements from russian officials such as threatening to target poland with nuclear weapons and things of that nature have certainly made this a much more difficult issue to deal with
7747742 as i mentioned the host governments retain the sovereignty and the legal right to decide who visits their territory threatening to target them with nuclear weapons is not something thats generally viewed positively to say the least
7747743 the russian government understands the limited capabilities of this system
7747744 we have had unprecedented discussions that have explained the technical capabilities of the system i think on the face of it they understand that 10 interceptors in poland would have no impact on the russian strategic offensive forces they know the capabilities of this system and they know it does not pose a threat to russia
7747745 the opening of international discussions on security and stability modalities in abkhazia and south ossetia
7747746 the capture of abu tiba and abu uthman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the al qaida in iraq network
7747747 iraqi and coalition forces have made great strides in improving security in iraq especially in baghdad
7747748 everyone has done a wonderful job of pulling together to help the people of georgia and we look forward to continuing to do our part to support these efforts
7747749 it is fair to say they are still not living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7747750 over the weekend we have 48 sorties that have flown in with 774 short tons of materials
7747751 we have received a report from unamid representatives there that the police of the government said that they had a search warrant from the court authorizing them to enter kalma camp to search for arms and possible wanted persons
7747752 they entered on their own and it seems that there are clashes going on and now we are sending an investigation team to make the assessment of the situation
7747753 and if it is meant to undermine the mdc then it is likely that the mdc will react quite hostilely
7747754 we are committed to the annapolis process we are doing the work that needs to be done to try to get an agreement before the end of the bush administration
7747755 the second is a declaration on a strategic cooperation between the united states and poland
7747756 this capability will be very important to our nato allies for their security just as its very important for the united states and poland
7747757 as if on cue the iranians just in the last couple of weeks have launched a space launch vehicle which again demonstrates additional capabilities and underscores the concerns we have about the growing missile threat from countries like iran
7747758 its not limited to iran i should hasten to add but its certainly an additional matter
7747759 we also talked about the desire of the united states and poland to pursue cooperation involving air and missile defense cooperation
7747760 well begin those deployments once of course we reach the necessary agreements with the poles and that could begin next year
7747761 and then we set the goal of establishing a garrison for the u s army patriot battery in poland by the year 2012
7747762 this is our tragic geopolitical fate but this is not 1921 they could not invade tbilisi they could not subjugate all georgia and nobody could make legal the annexation of our territory
7747763 i think western pressure already put on russia has had its effect
7747764 it works and it will work because russia depends on the west its not the soviet union that was self sufficient russia will have to somehow learn how to play by internationally recognized rules they cannot go unpunished
7747765 they dont have any right to do so they might attempt it testing the patience of the georgian government as well as the western allies
7747766 they will try to go as far as they are allowed i dont think its implementable but they might say something like that they might demand such stupid action
7747767 they want to strangle the georgian economy to make the georgian people as unhappy as possible in order for them to turn against their own government
7747768 its basically a subversion plan carried out by russian government against sovereign georgia
7747769 theyre still not in compliance with the cease fire agreement theyve established a number of checkpoints near the port city of poti and were very concerned about what russia is not doing and thats pulling its forces out in accordance with the cease fire agreement
7747770 they agreed to change the governor of the banadir region and the mayor of mogadishu
7747771 the president he accepted now i do not have exactly what was agreed but that is the most important
7747772 yusuf is banking on that they are not going to drop recognition of the tfg transitional federal government which is the only threat that really matters to him
7747773 and second of all he believes he can buy off parliament there is a lot of disaffection with nur adde among the old mp warlord interests and so he thinks he can swing parliament behind him
7747774 the icc is a stumbling block to this peace process and thats why we want the ugandan government to tell us what they want to do with the icc before we meet general joseph kony so that he can make a decision on what to do on the way forward
7747775 its not yet time for signing the agreement because there are so many contentions items in the agreement that he wants to look at
7747776 lra have not attacked any parts of congo in the last two to three months as far as i know
7747777 they are concocting it in order to create confusion that we dont reach a peaceful solution on sunday
7747778 implement a broad program of action and cooperation in various sectors including tourism and economic relations and across a range of fields from investments oil trade and the development of the oil industry
7747779 so getting cheap oil or a subsidized oil will definitely help boosting the lebanese economy which is now picking up fairly after the doha agreement and also after the growing tourism during this summer here in lebanon and as far as trade there are so many commodities that lebanon especially in the food industry and some pharmaceutical products that lebanon can again penetrate and export to the iraqi market yet due to security and lack of any coordination it is not happening or taking place
7747780 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7747781 we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7747782 i think the average person thinks im a f king nut and i deserve whatever happens to me thats what i believe
7747783 ever wondered who would play the roles in a movie version of the video game mike tysons punch out
7747784 simpsons first reaction was to go to the aid and protection of his fiancee and all sorts of things were going through his head
7747785 he saw a man trying to grope his fiancee trying to touch her breasts and he knew gardiner was a sex offender who had been jailed for offences of violence
7747786 it was extreme and grave provocation and he lost control
7747787 my client is now absolutely shocked by the gravity of his actions and is genuinely remorseful
7747788 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7747789 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7747790 that was immature and irresponsible on your part but i accept that you were not acting as a predator
7747791 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age

7747795 these two men were literally plucked off the body of the prostrate victim
7747796 this was a group attack where literally people took it in turns to assault a person on the ground
7747797 i just dont accept his evidence he was just walking out and looked over and saw what was happening and decided to join in
7747798 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7747799 barack obama will close the book on race and gender and group against group and straight against gay and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7747800 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7747801 i think about how one day theyll have families of their own and one day they and your sons and daughters will tell their own children about what we did together in this election theyll tell them how this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears how this time we decided to stop doubting and to start dreaming
7747802 i already gave the brown bag to my cousin on her b day last saturday and lovesd it i love the purses by the way
7747803 anthony wilding a gallant and generous sportsman and a brave gentleman
7747804 the war has exacted an appallingly heavy toll among the best and bravest athletes of the british empire but i believe none who will be more sincerely regretted in this country can be found in that ever increasing roll of honor than the late tony wilding
7747805 must not use i you must have a topic sentence in the first line of each paragraph
7747806 you are in the process of being indoctrinated we have not yet evolved a system of education that is not a system of indoctrination we are sorry but it is the best we can do what you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture the slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be you are being taught by people who have been able to accomodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors it is a self perpetuating system those of you who are more robust and individual than others will be encouraged to leave and find ways of educating yourself educating your own judgement those that stay must remember always and all the time that they are being moulded and patterned to fit into the narrow and particular needs of this society
7747807 make a double for him that should do the trick
7747808 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7747809 call goog 411 the company tells us that future versions of the headset could see other services added although right now its a google exclusive
7747810 i invest heavily in areas that look promising but also proportionately balance my risk by putting some money in standard investments such as stocks bonds and money market funds
7747811 the motivation to have money from a baseball betting portfolio in the future is great
7747812 but dont forget that you cant live in the future forever many people fall into the trap of not meeting basic needs in the present which logically means that their future will become progressively more difficult
7747813 make baseball betting investments work for you and retire wealthy
7747814 give yourself a nice cussion of cash and retirement income
7747815 personally i save about 10 each month for retirement 20 as liquid cash for everyday needs and another 40 for investing this may sound very demanding especially with regard to baseball betting investments but in actuality it is really a reflection of what you want for your future not necessarily what you want now
7747816 we want all of this to be simple and risk to be nominal the main area in which people have difficutly is assessing their wealth and risk factors far too often we see baseball betting investors jumping into a portfolio that is far too aggressive the end result can be disasterous invoking many to file bankruptcy
7747817 my top tip is making baby steps before giant leaps
7747818 by starting slowly your risk factor is greatly diminished and financial commitment is much lower you can get out at any time with minimal losses or move forward into more risky baseball betting areas with good fundamental knowledge
7747819 were looking at the long term here quick wins are for lotteries and penny poker games not the baseball betting investment market i think given enough time those who invest in this area will see good returns for their baseball betting money
7747820 given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke of burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7747821 there are going to be some of senator clintons supporters who were going to have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7747822 but if you take a look i think at this week i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7747823 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7747824 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7747825 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7747826 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7747827 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7747828 these animals were actually dying but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7747829 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7747830 its too early to say when in any election the important thing is to win but here because the election is critical i have to face the entire government machinery
7747831 so it is just not anwar versus the candidates but anwar versus the malaysian government the ruling parties and all the excesses you can think of
7747832 i voted for anwar because i think he can look after the interests of malays and other races
7747833 the merdeka survey results would suggest that anwar will not lose but he may not do exceptionally well either
7747834 we cant broadcast from the vibhavadi headquarters as there are 5 000 protesters on the premises
7747835 they shouted get out get out at us repeatedly all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7747836 we need to have greater clarity that this government is going to be around next year
7747837 the army will not launch a coup the people can be assured
7747838 ladies and gentleman in the course of us history a number of party nominees have used the vice presidential selection to help advance their own elections
7747839 she used to look up to us and now we look up to her
7747840 theyre a lot more like us than the press and the republicans have presented them to be
7747841 if you do what you always do youll get what youve always gotten so try something new
7747842 i wrote it in about a week and didnt change much when i was done not more than a sentence here and there i guess the story must have been dormant someplace in my mind waiting to be told
7747843 varios desaparecidos fueron localizados mediante siete frecuencias de radio emitidas por sus arva en franc s aparatos de b squeda de v ctimas por avalancha en el macizo del mont blanc pero el trabajo para extraer los cad veres no puede tener lugar a causa de la peligrosidad del terreno

7747850 hes hungry he loves to play and he has a lot of abilities and he makes them work for him
7747851 its not surprising what hes doing he plays everywhere has great at bats has big hits for us hes fun to watch
7747852 every time he hits a home run he helps us out there
7747853 there is absolutely no cause for this no reason for this continuing divide
7747854 wilder said adding later that he came to the morning panel to
7747855 we learned coming out of the caucuses that sound bites can in fact be detrimental
7747856 so irrespective of what may or may not happen on the convention floor the problem is you might have two or three people who will say something and that may become the headline
7747857 the longer youre divided the longer it takes for us to get the ball rolling
7747858 weve only got four good prime time hours at this convention and were using one of them for this
7747859 all i can say is obamas a bigger man than i am
7747860 no pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty national common interests and no foreign soldier should remain on iraqi land and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open
7747861 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7747862 any decisions on troops will be based on conditions on the ground in iraq
7747863 that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7747864 there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed there are discussions that continue in baghdad
7747865 we cant neglect our sons by giving an open immunity for anyone whether he is iraqi or a foreigner
7747866 gunmen in a landcruiser opened fire at the car but no one was hurt
7747867 it is a legitimate cause of concern we need to bring system and security management together
7747868 attacks signatures and storage will cause a fundamental difference in the way we look at security it will become more process centric in that it will become less important over time and businesses will be driving process
7747869 this is the year of the mobile device in the next few years access to information such as through a kiosk or handheld device will become more complex the channels role is to ensure that every customer understands what they have and where it lies in the market
7747870 as a reseller understands their clients environment many of which have elephant graveyards it will be their job to resolve these problems
7747871 this is because weve identified increased demand in this market across all vertical industries for our leading information protection and control solutions among enterprise customers
7747872 the new company backed by the financial and technical resources of our german parent company including access to our customer support centre in hong kong and utimacos recently launched new research and development centre near boston
7747873 our aim is to build our channel in order to help australian and new zealand enterprises and government departments meet their growing data protection needs

7747878 the objective of the film society is to conduct film trainings and workshops for local filmmakers in regular basis so their film making skills and understanding of cinema also rises to the world level
7747879 the target of the training was to teach the film makers the components of what constitutes good cinema
7747880 since we established pfs just six moths ago we wanted to conduct film trainings for the aspiring filmmakers of pokhara besides that pokhara has a lot of stories which could be told cinematically in very well manner so by letting them or by teaching them the basics of film i expect them to expose some of those very good stories deeply rooted in their tradition to the world outside

7747887 man muss auch dinge die die gro e koalition beschlossen hat infrage stellen
7747888 das cdu programm muss nicht da ansetzen wo die gro e koalition aufh rt
7747889 wenn wir auf dem parteitag unser profil zeigen wollen m ssen wir ganz klar sagen was in der koalition nicht in unserem sinn gewesen ist und von der spd durchgesetzt wurde
7747890 its great to see some innovative new plastics being released
7747891 another ideal method for their use has been to hook them on a 2 0 hook paternoster style rig in the same way as surf poppers in place of a second bait when targeting salmon and tailor etc
7747892 so kevin have you and greg thought about having kids
7747893 he wanted to know the history of pride how is it that every city has one what was the origin of it what was the whole story about stonewall
7747894 i knew that my coming out made a lot of people uncomfortable no matter what they said i never worried never wondered for a second what michelle and barack thought of me they were the kind of friends who i knew would always be with me
7747895 some people dont know what to make of obama because he hasnt known the leading gay activists or even his own advisers on gay issues for very long
7747896 the mafia doesnt know him david geffen james hormel david bohnett theyre not his friends
7747897 he and michelle dont just come to gay events for political reasons
7747898 they come because they understand the issues and they have friends in the community if he were to betray us it would be personal
7747899 we will close the book on the old politics of race against race and gender against gender and group against group and straight against gay
7747900 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7747901 this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock that every american north south east west young old will have decent heath care
7747902 we will close the book on the old politics of race against race and gender against gender and group against group and straight against gay
7747903 a group of three to four militants have infiltrated into the state through kanachak border after cutting the fence and under the cover of firing from the pakistan side around 1 45 am
7747904 a massive operation is on to track down the militants the border security force army and police have cordoned off the entire belt and tracker dogs have been pressed into operation
7747905 pakistan pushed in militants into this side of the border
7747906 we are looking into all aspects and we are not ruling out the possibility of pakistani rangers
7747907 its not a time for us to try to make sense of the tragedy for it was surely senseless
7747908 rather its a time to mourn in great sadness at the loss that has touched us all
7747909 they were very busy volunteers in many ways ken and margaret were batemans bay they were inseparable in life and will remain so in passing
7747910 the tragic death of margaret and ken is no doubt our darkest chapter the person responsible has destroyed our family
7747911 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7747912 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7747913 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department
7747914 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
7747915 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7747916 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7747917 look what grandma got me for christmas oooh theyre soooo cute look a pirate ship look lemonade drink look what grandma got me
7747918 i like mickey balls i like disneyland they have popcorn papi lets go to disneyland
7747919 its not like i dont love playing with them but
7747920 i know theyre a handful its ok to admit dad
7747921 if all these projects are completed i believe the northern provinces will become much less isolated from the rest of the country
7747922 the committee felt none of the candidates were robust enough
7747923 were hoping to be finished up by the end of this semester
7747924 you have to find somebody thats the right fit for you
7747925 the other 37 447 was supplemented from various places such as student government initiatives account which is supposed to be used for one time large funding projects
7747926 i cant justify spending money that wasnt allocated to a program
7747927 we want to keep the papers as much as we can but cut what we can to keep within the new budget
7747928 if we want more papers on campus the senate has the ability to pass a student referendum and well send it to the students
7747929 were not going to pursue the financial times because no one wants yesterdays news
7747930 business students want the option of having a business newspaper they can look at
7747931 i had my entire council talk to people in their classes and the resounding opinion is that everyone wants the wall street journal
7747932 id rather have the wall street journal than the financial times
7747933 and that would give students an incentive to join organizations
7747934 we arent trying to deliver some incredible rock n roll thing when we were in our 20s in oxford everything was really loud and fast but now we dont have to do that its friends getting together and playing music its relaxed
7747935 if we were going to write another chapter for blue mountain we wanted it to be good
7747936 we never designed a band that would be a country alternative band or an americana band we just wanted to write good songs
7747937 theres not a ton of psychology behind it when we played together the friendship and everything else just sorta fell into place
7747938 the band never had musical problems it was all personal no matter how close you get to someone at some point you need a damn break
7747939 theres always been this separation between music you hear in church and music you hear in a bar we used to do a great cover of amazing grace and one night this guy came up to us afterwards screaming you cant play the lords music in a bar i thought to myself if god exists in church he certainly exists in a bar
7747940 his sterling academic credentials as a professor of history with expertise on south africa confirm his intellectual and institutional leadership that promise to enhance our graduate school
7747941 it excited me to get to look at things in a new way that no one else had discovered
7747942 i came to the united states because of my strong interest in african history
7747943 i am looking forward to meeting as many graduate students as i can when i get to campus
7747944 we just need someone who can manage the offense well
7747945 the pressure of youre the starter i dont think thats necessary until a little later in the week probably thursday
7747946 i cant tell you today who will take the field first but ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7747947 if somebody were to get an ingrown toenail between now and then it wouldnt make any difference because the other guy would start anyway whoever that guy was
7747948 would i like to have a guy that i understand exactly how its going to be when the bullets fly sure
7747949 im going to have to see how it plays out
7747950 whoever coach puts out there i just cant wait to see him shine
7747951 hes young hes hungry and hes motivated hes doing everything he can
7747952 hes in the training room every day he gets frustrated but he has to understand that we have a bigger goal in mind
7747953 whether youre named the starter before or youre just out on the field playing i think youre playing the game and thats your focus
7747954 we really feel that there will be no limitations to our center
7747955 were going to see how that goes but were optimistic hell be ready to play
7747956 its not often enough that we tell him how proud we are of him as a school and as a coaching staff and the impact that hes had on our school and our community when it comes to football
7747957 i had to step up as far as being a leader but i dont really have to do too much because these guys im working with now theyre real good guys real smart great communicators
7747958 he wasnt always as vocal as maybe some people think leaders need to be vocal
7747959 he didnt have to talk often but when he did everybody listened
7747960 and if i have a question i know theyre going to be able to answer it for me
7747961 one thing that he always did that i can remember is he is such an extremely hard worker
7747962 any time you combine a kid whos got that god given ability with the work ethic and the passion and the drive and the desire that he had ultimately youre going to have a successful player
7747963 it was signing week or the week just prior to signing week his junior year that former lsu coach nick saban came here to the school and said that they were going to offer him
7747964 i brought him in to the coaches office and talked to him
7747965 i said curtis were going to move you because i think its going to help us offensively and he said coach whatevers best for the team i kind of expected him to say that
7747966 this year at franklintons graduation he said coach when you going to come to a game
7747967 i said curtis i promise ill make one this year
7747968 i wont make a commitment right now but my inclination is to sign on
7747969 when you sign these broad statements that say youre going to do something then you have to be prepared to do it
7747970 the presidents climate commitment is an excellent way for colleges and universities to show leadership in working towards a more sustainable society
7747971 once ive reflected on it my inclination is to tilt in that direction because obviously ive bought it one other time and believed in it in that setting why wouldnt i here
7747972 i dont sign anything because i dont think signing those things does any good
7747973 if youre going to do something you ought to do it if youre not going to do something you ought not to do it but signing statements doesnt help
7747974 one example is we have trouble getting recycle bins put in some places
7747975 from my understanding the presidential climate commitment is too short of a timeline for the lsu system to deem feasible to incorporate into the plans for lsu
7747976 if lsu truly wants to be the flagship university it claims to be then we need to lead the way in responsible sustainable development
7747977 part of that commitment is to begin to carry on a dialogue with students about you change not just how the campus works but how we change the larger society and become more conscious of it
7747978 lets begin the conversation about how to educate people better about all those issues out there that theyre going to have to cope with when old guys like me are gone
7747979 following a difficult first half year mpc capital has set itself very ambitious objectives for the second half of 2008 as expected we were able to start distribution of a number of important products towards the end of the second quarter we are therefore confident that the product portfolio that is available for the second half of the year will generate the projected equity result and profits as well as stable margins
7747980 mpc capital geht nach einem schwierigen ersten halbjahr mit sehr ambitionierten zielen in die zweite h lfte des gesch ftsjahres 2008 wie erwartet konnten wir gegen ende des zweiten quartals eine reihe wichtiger produkte in den vertrieb bringen daher sind wir zuversichtlich dass das f r das zweite halbjahr zur verf gung stehende produktportfolio mit stabilen margen das prognostizierte eigenkapitalvolumen und ergebnis erwirtschaften wird
7747981 all the way home building a family in a falling down house
7747982 these data reflect the hard work of our students parents teachers and administrators
7747983 we are really excited to be back at tour of ireland this time with the new team type 1 squad
7747984 kobzarenko and aldape both had strong showings in ireland last year and i think the new race format will favor guys like glen chadwick and matt wilson
7747985 the team is in good form right now so we will be trying for a good gc spot and we are always in the hunt for stage victories
7747986 the tour of ireland is a top shelf event offering some of the best in european cycling
7747987 it is also a big opportunity to put fabio in another major international stage race and give him an opportunity to not only contribute to the teams winning efforts but also tell his story about controlling diabetes and taking charge of your life to a whole new audience
7747988 the ministry of interior has appointed women as deputy provincial governors in all the provinces and municipalities except pailin where it is still looking for a candidate
7747989 we are carrying out our long term policy regarding the integration of women into cambodias political affairs
7747990 it was just great to meet him and meet people you usually see on tv like tennis no1 rafael nadal and roger federer
7747991 for me michael phelps is a real inspiration and someone you really look up to
7747992 thats her business and now that were friends its not something i have to worry about
7747993 shes a mature girl and makes her own decisions and were just enjoying being friends and thats something you just cant take away
7747994 were enjoying being good friends we spent two years together and thats something you dont forget quickly
7747995 please take these instructions to heart and abide by them
7747996 she was deliberately very forcefully thrown out by a very strong man
7747997 knowing her nose better than anyone else i was in a unique position to take care of the problem
7747998 i think i possibly welcomed those comments and i shouldnt have
7747999 there had been a sexual act and he had to pay her back

7748011 this result comes after a year of step change within the business in terms of our scale and position within the sector having successfully integrated two major acquisitions during the year and added considerably to our existing operations through strong growth
7748012 m2 wholesale saw revenues jump a remarkable 440 percent to 56 8 million during the period with unitel contributing for four months of the period and the remainder of the growth being generated organically
7748013 the orion acquisition fuelled growth in m2s retail business contributing a 56 percent increase in year on year revenues in 51 9 million
7748014 barack obama steht f r den wandel den wir brauchen
7748015 ich habe den eindruck es gibt hier eine aufbruchstimmung das ist nat rlich etwas was sich jede partei f r ihre parteitage w nscht
7748016 wenn man z b zur kenntnis nimmt wie stark hier die energiefrage die umweltfrage gerade bei diesem parteitag thematisiert wird das ist etwas wo wir viel zusammentun k nnen viel voneinander lernen k nnen
7748017 wir werden allen amerikanern auf diesem parteitag zeigen warum wir barack obama und joe biden im wei en haus brauchen
7748018 wir k nnen uns keine weiteren vier jahre eine solche ineffektive art des regierens leisten
7748019 nicht nichts konnte mich davon abhalten zu diesem ganz speziellen parteitag heute abend zu kommen

7748027 thats how baseball is said giants catcher bengie molina whose double play grounder crushed a promising third inning
7748028 one day you feel great and you help the team big time the next day youre not so lucky
7748029 we had the right hitters up giants manager bruce bochy said
7748030 theyre both doing a great job for us this year its pretty simple their guy executed he got what he was looking for
7748031 love zone the south bay native drove the belt high fastball to the deepest part of right center field
7748032 one of the purposes of our research is to develop better designs for precast concrete buildings
7748033 this is really important to our industry because well be able to develop structures that can resist natures most difficult loads including earthquakes
7748034 we conducted tests from lower seismicity all the way to higher seismicity and shook the building stronger and stronger each time with a higher intensity
7748035 since that time we have been working to come up with designs that will make these structures survive a northridge earthquake or stronger
7748036 we are only able to perform physical experiments on that one structure but if we can show that our models capture important response properly we can run hundreds of earthquake simulations a year for the cost of a graduate student a fast computer and a software license which at around 50 000 is substantially less than the costs of these kinds of tests
7748037 the englekirk center is very important to the research community and to the industry because it has an outdoor environment where we can perform large scale tests that cant be done anywhere else in the world
7748038 the syrians are making noise about the weapons deals to pressure the us to provide sponsorship for the talks
7748039 the syrians are hoping to use the talks with israel to gain more credit and strengthen ties with the us
7748040 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
7748041 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power

7748047 when i was a boy growing up in kansas a friend of mine and i went fishing and as we sat there on the warmth of a summer afternoon we talked about what we wanted to do when we grew up i told him i wanted to be a major league baseball player a genuine professional like honus wagner my friend said that hed like to be president of the united states neither of us got our wish

7748050 mimicry is an insult i am an actor i have only played the role of the chief minister in the movie since i have not been a chief minister myself i learned by observing the style and mannerisms of v s on tv so it is possible some of his characteristic style has influenced my character in the movie

7748077 my dad has been waiting for this moment his whole life
7748078 they came to n c state werent highly recruited and their first year they were on the cover of sports illustrated they were doing something about freshmen who made an impact sports illustrated told me it came down to archie griffin or the buckey twins and they said they went with the buckey twins
7748079 he wasnt highly recruited and came to south carolina and what i learned from him is you can succeed if nobody believes in you you cant succeed if you dont believe in yourself he was absolutely right he wasnt fast he wasnt big he was 5 10 180 pounds but was mvp in the bowl game when we beat ohio state
7748080 the game that turned it around was probably the duke game when we were 1 2 1 we put on a great goal line stand
7748081 we had the second largest turnaround in the history of ncaa football from 0 11 in 1999 to 8 4 in 2000 that was a monumental win
7748082 when i was at n c state we had four little children n c state didnt pay you a whole lot so we didnt eat out a whole lot
7748083 two passes hit our defensive backs hands and bounced over his head and they caught them for touchdowns we just didnt play as well as i thought they could have or should have
7748084 we had a touchdown called back for offensive pass interference and then he clemsons rod gardner pushes off and catches it to set up the winning touchdown
7748085 the rain was unbelievable it was the most miserable ive ever seen i remember we played a very good defensive football game we moved the ball but we turned it over
7748086 the fans at n c state were really tremendous they sold the stadium out sat on that hill back there and were enthusiastic the fans at south carolina even when you lose there were 80 000 there theyre very good schools but theyre city schools also they have a campus but they have a city theres a lot to do its a great place to live there really are a lot more similarities than there are things that are dissimilar
7748087 they have great talent they have potentially four or five first round draft picks on defense
7748088 who knew i could personally whiten my smile so well without paying a ton of money to a dentist
7748089 with a new administration on the horizon many of us are hoping things will change for the better we are all hoping our voices will be heard and our concerns met with solutions this project allows me to voice and magnify the all too often ignored opinions of the american people my research has led me to speak with so many citizens nation wide and the stories of your struggles combined with the knowledge of my own struggles have given birth to the project now known as i heard it today
7748090 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7748091 we shall do all that is possible to save them

7748100 we will continue to increase the patrols and indeed even as i speak now we are moving to increase the patrols further
7748101 we will continue to communicate with our students and indeed the mobile security that we have on campus will be increased as well
7748102 brisbane is really as a growing city is getting a lot of pressure on what weve got the facilities weve already got so its important that we make sure that we are processing the applications that facilitate visitors coming to the city and facilitate conventions and conferences
7748103 it has applications for all types of buildings and trains and transport systems
7748104 it will quite clearly attract the attentions of many agencies looking at combating severe graffiti problems which cost taxpayers many millions of dollars each year in clean up
7748105 the security industry is an industry with around 2 7 billion invested in it each year 40 per cent of that is actually spent in new south wales
7748106 these new technologies will hopefully assist these companies to grow and in growing create further income and employment in new south wales
7748107 good deal of the cuts are in the newspaper production area we can be more productive and itll have absolutely no impact on quality
7748108 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7748109 this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7748110 you cant have those sort of cuts and keep providing the same sorts of service to your community
7748111 a significant number will come out of editorial i think they say therell be about 120 jobs lost out of editorial
7748112 from what we see of their statements so far most of those will come out of the age and the sydney morning herald
7748113 to think you can do that without undermining the quality of those papers i think defies belief
7748114 and the mechanic unfortunately has been trapped under the bus and hes died as a result
7748115 the feeling i get going around the country is that governments support is a lot softer than the published polls
7748116 every day there is more evidence of economic and job insecurity
7748117 the government is a hostage to fortune with no hand on the tiller
7748118 we get such a kick out of seeing the work and effort that locals put in

7748123 er zijn 2 7 miljoen aansluitingen en 4 5 miljoen gezinnen er is dus nog potentieel
7748124 the more things change the more they remain the same
7748125 i really dont know what to expect to be honest with you
7748126 im definitely thankful for the opportunity i just hope to play well and well see what happens
7748127 its the kind of a thing where im going to give it a shot and see where it goes a lot of different things a lot of difference scenarios could come into play
7748128 obviously thats nothing compared to an nhl season but the training helped me prepare for coming down here
7748129 i kind of thought there was a possibility it could be over
7748130 he was a really good player for us for a number of years
7748131 hes had a personal setback with the passing of his brother he missed a year of hockey based on what he did for us when he was here we wanted to give him an opportunity to get his career back on track
7748132 will it end up being with us or will it be a steppingstone to help him go to another team time will tell but hes relatively young enough and talented enough to get his game back
7748133 in order to grow and do what we want in terms of a scholarship standpoint there are going to have to be some games where you bring in some revenue
7748134 and revenue affects everything you do and i can honestly say that we have some games that are going to pay us better than weve ever been paid before
7748135 we have more depth at every position offense defense and special teams
7748136 its been a crazy camp ive never had one like this said third year coach darrell asberry who conducted a kind of football boot camp with more contact and conditioning than usual
7748137 we still have to fill voids with young guys in the offensive line coach michael costa said
7748138 but weve made great strides guys understand the offense now
7748139 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7748140 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7748141 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7748142 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7748143 i think the guy will do a great job of managing our team and the team has responded really well to him and thats where we are going
7748144 they want to see if there is any interest there
7748145 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7748146 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7748147 we are going to go forward with the players that we have
7748148 and we are always looking for and searching for people who can help our team and nothing is going to change with regard to that
7748149 were going to try to kill the ant with the sledgehammer
7748150 one of the things that bryon has done is that every practice from the spring practice has been consistent hes played at the same level or better than he has no steps backward
7748151 well use the guy that we think gives us the best chance to execute that kick
7748152 if someone emerges during the course of the season that can handle it than so be it if its kicking by committee thats ok too
7748153 there is no speculation that anybody past those three guys will play
7748154 gregs going to get the lions share of the carries earlier well probably try to get ryan in he and shaun are sort of splitting time in that or situation in the second group probably right now ryan is slightly ahead in some respect
7748155 i like his demeanor he has a very strong leg ive put pressure on him in practice and he has responded favorably
7748156 if we had the same head coach all four years we would have won more games
7748157 we have spent a lot of time learning new things and new terminology
7748158 im glad they named coach dinwiddie ive known him for four years
7748159 i am a very loyal person ive been with these guys all four years even though i didnt have control of the program
7748160 god has a plan for everybody sometimes we have to be humbled to become a better person that happened to me
7748161 i was young and looking back i really didnt have a clue
7748162 everybody likes to think they are ready for the next step but i wasnt
7748163 he has run the weight program so all of the guys know him
7748164 he is a much better coach than he was years ago
7748165 right now there is a team that is flying underneath the radar but is going to have a great year
7748166 brickey will offer a broad range of support for our student athletes plus tremendous experience at duke as well as pursuing a national championship which he did in his career
7748167 im thrilled he has head coaching experience and he understands what it takes to effectively run a program and i anticipate many many conversations furthering our development of our camps on campus recruiting and other relevant issues
7748168 roberts passion for duke is totally motivating to all of us here
7748169 smoak has so much love and passion for duke really wants to be here and wants to learn from an elite program
7748170 sarah is a tireless worker and has already shown such great commitment throughout camp this summer

7748308 qbps seminars at frostbike are popular as are the clinics held at interbike but there is too much else going on and the seminars are too short to really get into the issues some manufacturers put on regional training clinics but the dealers dont get to actually work on the bikes while they learn

7748323 airstrikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7748324 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7748325 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7748326 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7748334 that was probably the best part of our performance tonight
7748335 if we had been a little more consistent with our concentration we probably could have won it in three sets but alters tough they didnt give up and kept coming back
7748336 this was a great match for an opener i think it gave both sides a good indication of where their strengths will be and where they have to improve
7748337 the best thing about the match is that we didnt give up
7748338 we were down five points in every game but the last one but came back to take the lead or win
7748339 our biggest problem is that we didnt pass well we need to really improve on that area if we want to be the type of team we think we can be its a good opener for both of us were both d ii i hope we have a chance to see them again in the tournament

7748346 hes gained some confidence in his game and thats one of the most important things at this level
7748347 as with any position well do whats best to improve our team
7748348 im disappointed for our football team but im also disappointed for him
7748349 hes a guy who was on our practice squad last year worked his tail off all offseason and was really having a good camp with a strong possibility of making our football team

7748367 i had to wait to get on the treadmill because there were so many people ready to get into fighting shape to win this election
7748368 i thought for this election for this time we really needed to bring fundamental change in this country and i thought barack obama was the person to do that
7748369 well i felt differently i felt we did not need a person who was not seasoned
7748370 hillary has always been seasoned since day one shes done some great things and hillary should have been the nominee i understand about barack a nice handsome young man i think in four years eight years he would be great

7748400 what accounts for the difference in the way people react
7748401 i didnt go out but my mum panicked and she went to the door and saw a man sitting on the footpath by a dark car
7748402 was tall and wearing a dark jacket and when he saw the light he got up and started asking for help
7748403 i didn amp squo t go out but my mum panicked and she went to the door and saw a man sitting on the footpath by a dark car
7748404 david twohy right now is writing the scripts the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7748405 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7748406 that was one of those deals where i couldnt get by him
7748407 i had to ask myself would he do that to me and he has before and thats the way it goes
7748408 i just kind of ran into him thats what happened i have a lot of respect for the guy and he was real fast but we cant give up points when theyre right there for us to take
7748409 no because he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry
7748410 he did it at milwaukee in the nascar nationwide series and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that
7748411 i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him hamlin toward the end
7748412 i like my spotter hes a good guy but man this is ridiculous
7748413 we took a bunch of cars out for no reason i was just running along heard clear clear clear and went up and there was someone still there we just took out a bunch of cars for no reason and ourselves
7748414 we had a good racecar and its a shame we got caught up in that mess
7748415 i just saw cars wrecking in front of me and there was nothing i could do
7748416 its fun to be able to win at any race track in anything
7748417 but to be able to do the sweep here at bristol its pretty awesome
7748418 getting back to chicago is a great plus for the series
7748419 its just one more avenue for fans to become nascar craftsman truck series fans
7748420 the layout of the mile and a half track is like no other that we currently race at
7748421 and under the lights it will all make for an exciting race
7748422 were excited about the nascar craftsman truck series coming to chicagoland speedway
7748423 to meet the growing excitement of the motorsports fan base in the chicago market it bodes very well with our efforts to really continue to try to provide the best possible experience when our fans and guests come to chicagoland speedway
7748424 its much harder to prepare for a team where the coach was thrown out of there because they werent very good and then they change everything up
7748425 were playing as if theres no changes in their offense defense and special teams
7748426 theyre experienced and theyre veterans coach vance bedford has done a really good job with them im expecting that to be somewhat an area of strength for us well be challenged in the first game
7748427 one way to evaluate a good team ive done this for many years i always watch the kicking game right away
7748428 if they have a good kickoff return team its usually a very well coached team and pays attention to detail and their two return teams punt returning and kickoff return are two of the best in the country
7748429 hes got to work through the acclimatization period right now because he wasnt with us at all he didnt practice at all through camp
7748430 he wont be available this week against hawaii but hes still on scholarship and were going to try and work him back into the program and back on the team but he definitely wont be available this week
7748431 that wouldnt be bad either im sure they have a great system there
7748432 hes a true freshman hes 218 19 pounds right now a couple more peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and hell be up to 221
7748433 its a real shame because rick is close to timmy and james wilson
7748434 the access to this site is denied by its own decision
7748435 the access to this website is prevented by court order
7748436 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7748437 at least arguably suggest the petitioner lacks a rational understanding of the causal link between his role in his criminal offense and the reason he has been sentenced to death
7748438 a system which requires an insane person to first make a substantial showing of his own lack of mental capacity without the assistance of counsel or a mental health expert in order to obtain such assistance is by definition an insane system
7748439 assam and the northeast is always on the high list of recruitment in the it zones of the country most of the ne region students seen to move outside of the state like bangaluru delhi hydrabad for the latest it revolution experience but from now the entire region will have the facility to adequate themselves with the latest it trend at their locality i am very glad to be inaugurating the scope for the region and hope that this will turn the future of the countrys young mind from this region tcs a globally acclaimed organization is surely giving the students and the it fever of the state a high up with international standard of training and education hope assam and the rest of the region will take the most advantage of the tcs and it will rise on the top of the countrys brain zone i will direct the state government to take the most care of it and its education
7748440 tcs is committed to develop the talents of the country and it will also extend its service to the abundant talents of the region
7748441 i am having the highest standard of it revolution at tcs it will surly boost the rest of the state for the people like me and one day assam with the north east will grow to the it industry like other country students of the region will now have the facility to learn the high tech world at their doorstep and i congratulate the assam government and tcs for it
7748442 tcs has been partnering with the ne states to implement several e governance projects its vat solution has helped reduce tax evasion significantly and increase interoperability of various government machineries is the six northeastern states of assam manipur mizoram tripura nagalnad and arunachal pradesh tcs have also included the distisation of the assam tresury and assam public works department has enhanced transparency and efficiency in government process to benefit the state economy
7748443 it was kind of pathetic to tell you the truth
7748444 i want to find a job that is hard for everyone and i cannot see well
7748445 i even find it hard to tell what money people are giving me so i dont know what i can do
7748446 but the years of war have meant that its not been possible to do that in south sudan
7748447 we just dont have the surgeons or the clinical officers
7748448 the problem in south sudan is not only disease itself its the problem of how to build the capacity of the local people to help them cater for their own people
7748449 we work hard but we survive on our own without funding
7748450 these are too expensive each is about three dollars and we cannot even get the papers we need for writing braille for our educational programme
7748451 i have not ceased being fearful but i have ceased to let fear control me
7748452 one should never hurry to the non canonical field however it came out like this and there were priests and they had to guide the flock somehow
7748453 i think if it is good will it is possible not to leave people of the one holy orthodox apostolic church without spiritual care
7748454 some men see things as they are and say why
7748455 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of moral crisis preserved their neutrality
7748456 tot ce se intampla in aceasta serie se intampla si in viata de zi cu zi
7748457 sabits announcement that he will run for president is against the code of conduct so the announcement means that he has resigned and the president has approved this
7748458 the board believes that dr egans proven track record of success at the high school coupled with his unsurpassed dedication to the children of district 95 make him a great candidate for taking our district to even greater levels of achievement
7748459 i think the challenges are getting the facilities issues straightened out
7748460 theres some long range facilities planning that we need to follow through on the work doesnt scare me and im looking forward to it
7748461 thats something that dr knutson and i will be working on together
7748462 she had a vision for what the 50th anniversary should be and she brought all these people together to bring her ideas to fruition
7748463 i wasnt surprised she would receive this honor i was wondering why it took so long
7748464 we just have a lot of fun trying to do things to show the community what this village has become in the past 50 years how it started out what a great village it has become and what a great place it is to live
7748465 people can actually put a face to all the planning
7748466 i want them to learn the importance of being involved and contributing to the community you live in
7748467 municipal elections have notoriously low turnouts but those elected officials are the people who will affect your everyday life
7748468 i like trying to do things to make the community better
7748469 this is not about not supporting the affected communities because we do
7748470 if its going to happen we need to extract the maximum benefit for citizens
7748471 jam s vendi nada como tampoco lo he hecho yo
7748472 i cant say enough about what kind of athlete and kid she is
7748473 being the first to sign with the gators is exciting
7748474 first of all ive admired mary wise for as long as i have played
7748475 being able to be perched beside her since i started playing volleyball was something ive always wanted
7748476 but i had some time to digest it and ill be ready to go
7748477 i havent worried about that because i dont control that
7748478 i feel like ive done a lot for this team over the last five years ive had some unfortunate things happen to me and some bad games but for the most part i feel like ive been a pretty good contributor to this organization
7748479 weve won a lot of games when ive played im proud of a lot of things ive done and im not paying attention to anyone or anything that will try to tell me otherwise
7748480 i felt like this was a great option for me to come back and start
7748481 it didnt happen but the seasons just around the corner im not anticipating anything happening but ive got to be ready because that moment could be the biggest moment of my career ive got to take off and be ready to go
7748482 its something i have to deal with right now but im going to make sure i do whatever i need to do to make sure im a great player in this league
7748483 my personal goals havent changed my role in the immediate future has changed but my outlook hasnt changed at all
7748484 i hear its a great place big time college football the crowd all of that stuff i think it will be exciting for our guys the only thing weve done is go over to our stadium and turned on the speakers for crowd noise thats what weve done to try to simulate it we wont experience it until were there
7748485 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7748486 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7748487 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7748488 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7748489 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7748490 going the extra mile for our customers when it comes to providing them with convenience
7748491 its icky to go on and on about how much you love shelfari without mentioning youre paid by them
7748492 i had a cluster of plantar warts treated by a dermatologist she used a liquid nitrogen spray which was excruciatingly painful my kidney stone was less painful the warts persisted even after this treatment then i treated them with warm water soaks and duct tape which i kept on all day the warts went away and stayed away after about six weeks of treatment
7748493 what are we doing i just want to go home now
7748494 made us proud through their inspiring and courageous achievements in beijing
7748495 look out across a sea of welsh flags and for the cheers to be heard in weston super mare

7748500 sheila eventually traced the problem to a coding disparity at her doctors office she says letters and phone calls to both her doctor and mib have been to no avail and the problem remains uncorrected on her record effectively blocking her from obtaining individual health coverage
7748501 thats an awful lot of shampoo to use on your head
7748502 we make significant investments in training and technology to stay one step ahead of these professional criminals
7748503 we are really excited as hull are in the premier league at home and its a little bit of repeating the history
7748504 for hull to be in the premier league is a massive achievement and for us to be in the championship with the squad weve got is remarkable when you look back at that day
7748505 if someone could have predicted that day where the two clubs would be today they would have deserved a lot of credit
7748506 i o i o so off to work i go they cant afford to pay me well cause just like me they owe

7748541 dont be fooled into thinking this means its one big happy family working together in concert theres still to my mind a surprisingly large amount of negative feelings on both sides with these two camps

7748700 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore finds to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
7748701 likely to face competitive constraints from suppliers located outside their geographic region although the extent of this competitive constraint will vary depending upon fluctuations in sea freight prices
7748702 there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore funds at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle
7748703 in particular vale would be the only other supplier involved in annual benchmark price negotiations
7748704 is likely to result in a substantial lessening of the competition in the supply or iron ore lump and iron ore fines
7748705 in the event that the merged firm decided to withdraw its participation in the proposed port terminal expansion of the outer harbor at port hedland wa

7748715 the night reo speedwagon played was our best night since we opened 12 years ago we turned over the dining room four times the take out side was packed it was unbelievable

7748717 ive met a lot of people from out of town who said lockport looks a lot better than the last time they were here everything was wonderful
7748718 david ulrich kathy paradowski and mayor mike tucker did a really good job it was a great idea for getting people to come here who normally dont and people were happy with what they found
7748719 i heard no complaints which is unusual hopefully next year itll get bigger and bigger
7748720 i can safely say we did see some additional room nights because of the series
7748721 it certainly hasnt hurt our business and its fabulous for the city its good for the economy
7748722 some of that money well get back in bed tax and sales tax and some businesses will prosper the quality of life these concerts bring to the community thats worth something too

7748724 its the wrong venue thats my complaint its all concrete and blacktop theres nothing to absorb the noise
7748725 it shows no regard for other people im not saying it shouldnt be done just do it somewhere else in a place with grass and trees or in an amphitheater

7748732 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold

7749036 retailers experimenting with web 2 0 experiences will largely find benefit from them in the form of branding and awareness building rather than direct sales as social media has shown little direct impact on actual online retail sales

7749053 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7749054 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7749055 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought

7749075 our conditions were uncomfortable but because were westerners we suffered absolutely nothing compared to what the tibetan people suffer

7749105 i really dont know what to expect to be honest with you
7749106 im definitely thankful for the opportunity i just hope to play well and well see what happens
7749107 its the kind of a thing where im going to give it a shot and see where it goes a lot of different things a lot of difference scenarios could come into play
7749108 obviously thats nothing compared to an nhl season but the training helped me prepare for coming down here
7749109 i kind of thought there was a possibility it could be over
7749110 he was a really good player for us for a number of years
7749111 hes had a personal setback with the passing of his brother he missed a year of hockey based on what he did for us when he was here we wanted to give him an opportunity to get his career back on track

7749113 all day long its been chaotic in colorado from protesters to a possible assassination plot but what is it really like at the dnc theres no one better to ask than los angeles national media writer james rainey who is there right now james can you tell us what was it like on the convention floor when that possible assassination plot happened was there chaos in the convention hall
7749114 uhhh no there was far from chaos here i think you know people heard about this word sort of filtered through the convention center but people didnt think there was any real immediate danger to them or to senator obama really youd be surprised how little buzz there was about that
7749115 with six people that escaped i would have to surmise there was some planning involved in this and thats what i want to have the investigation look into did staff miss signals did they miss signs that there was something going on did the actual day to day operations contribute to this in some shape or form
7749116 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards

7749140 yo creo que perfectamente puede haber una primera vuelta en que haya dos aspirantes oficialistas a la moneda y en la segunda vuelta va a quedar uno resaltando que no soy catastrofista
7749141 creo que si la concertaci n representa a una coalici n que ha demostrado ser capaz de gobernar durante cuatro periodos y no hay ninguna raz n para que por el hecho de un cambio como ese esto capotara
7749142 la coalici n gobernante aprueba un programa de gobierno y este pudiera tener en una primera vuelta dos candidatos es decir ambos con el mismo programa indudablemente que ir con dos candidatos con programas distintos es anunciar el quiebre de la concertaci n

7749153 i understand that a lot of people are asking what does hillary want what does she want well i want what i have always fought for in this whole campaign
7749154 i want to end the war in iraq i want to turn this economy around i want health care for every american i want every child to live up to his or her god given potential and i want the nearly 18 million americans who voted for me to be respected to be heard and no longer to be invisible
7749155 while i traveled our country talking about how i wanted to help you time and again you reached out to help me to grab my hand or grip my arm to look into my eyes and tell me dont quit keep fighting stay in this race for us
7749156 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7749157 dont be fooled into thinking this means its one big happy family working together in concert theres still to my mind a surprisingly large amount of negative feelings on both sides with these two camps
7749158 when it comes to finishing the fight rocky and i have a lot in common i never quit
7749159 to be able to get the big hit its great
7749160 i was looking for a pitch so i could hit it in the gap so raul could score the pitch came to the middle of the plate and i hit it good enough it went out of the ballpark

7749229 the audience is going to have to get ready for a departure from a lot of the story lines from earlier
7749230 theres a lot of the storylines that have been to put to rest there was an original mythology to the show and i think now the writers want to move towards a different mythology
7749231 thats part of the introduction of new characters and new story lines the audience should get ready to experience a whole new direction for the show
7749232 most of the big story lines we need to keep a wrap on i dont want to spoil it for everyone but there is a big big reveal this season that i think will make the first eight episodes kind of memorable then really send the show off into a different direction
7749233 i think definitely we have a couple of kind of zany episodes right off the bat its a lot of big high jinks and big special effects so its a little less of the relationship super drama that we had last season its kind of procedural sci fi each week theres a big scientific calamity and we solve the case

7749253 the rivers appear to have peaked which is a good thing
7749254 remaining rain areas of light rain or drizzle should clear during wednesday morning

7749256 for the past five years there has been a noticable trade imbalance between the usa and other nations working within the national media marketing market particularly in operations and human capital the recent advances however will help mend this rift and keep more dollars on shore i expect to see demand for labor increase in the long run with additional long run profits for strong national media marketing usa companies that move forward
7749257 to keep things fair for all parties were going to begin a general auction for our new products within 30 days anyone who wants in and we know that almost everyone does will have an opportunity to bid on the product first dibs go to the top 3 companies who will enjoy a 90 period free of competition from other national media marketing entities once this period expires other companies can access our new technology and use it as they see fit
7749258 im pleased to report that technological advances by artman braisted inc have created a much higher degree of efficieny in operations this means big profits for most national media marketing related companies and their subsidiaries
7749259 output of national media marketing related products will nearly double overhead will decrease by 1 3 and employee salaries will increase by 15
7749260 the recent news in the national media marketing industry means big things for us including the need to expand our physical building and operations well be able to hire an additional and much needed 100 new employees who will help push our efforts forward this is going to be great
7749261 our fingers are crossed that corporate execs will honor all current contracts and not fire anyone
7749262 and if all contracts are solid were willing to negotiate with management at an appropriate time in the future to make sure our interests are being satisfied
7749263 im getting calls from national media marketing industry executives investors and general employees all asking about what is going on and if they can provide information for the news agency of course they want their names mentioned so that a little publicity is given to their particular national media marketing company but it does save me from hunting these people down and taking interviews
7749264 i predict stocks will rocket to 30 increases settle and finally creep their way up to 52 week highs
7749265 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
7749266 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
7749267 if you thought you couldnt afford a hasselblad think again
7749268 for a little more than high end 35mm solutions and much less than many competing medium format solutions you too can begin using the worlds most advanced digital camera system
7749269 these two are wrong and did you hook up the battery charger cables to the battery
7749270 its definitely the best move footy wise i could have made
7749271 im loving my time here and looking forward to another two years
7749272 the first year i dealt with a bit of homesickness and missing family and friends as anyone would when you change your job and your state
7749273 but from then on ive really built some momentum in my footy and also the way that ive handled things off the field so im very settled here in melbourne
7749274 if someone said a couple of years ago youre going to win a best and fairest or be in the mix i would have thought id made the transition back to wafl footy pretty well
7749275 the position were in at the moment and with a young side i think momentums really important going into the finals
7749276 to win a fourth game straight possibly is going to be a big spur on to do well in the finals and give us a lot of confidence
7749277 anyone thats up to speed on the dynamics of the trade that went through i didnt really have a whole heap of say in what went on so if people sort of bear that in mind i think theyll go easy on me
7749278 advanced amateur photographers blur the line between the hobbyist and the professional looking for professional features and capabilities in their equipment that will allow them to capture that awe inspiring image canon is constantly striving to provide these shooters with the most advanced imaging technology like the new eos 50d digital slr camera to fuel their passion for photography and help them achieve their creative potential
7749279 i entered this new zone and im harvesting corn this doesnt feel very heroic
7749280 id like to be carving my sword through hordes of enemies but all i can find are harvest quests
7749281 id like to be helping these farmers because i find harvesting more fun after work than killing but i only have quests to kill bandits
7749282 id like to go searching for the rare fish this guy is talking about but apparently he wont spawn unless ive completed all this guys other quests ugh
7749283 i just want to sit and grind while watching tv i dont feel like running back and forth besides ive done the quests in this zone with 4 alts already
7749284 bring me 10 bear ears but only pristine bear ears regular ones wont do
7749285 now the thing about having a baby and i cant be the first person to have noticed this is that thereafter you have it
7749286 if im hearing caroline kennedy right barack obama is the second coming of teddy kennedy
7749287 caroline listed kennedys many achievements with the refrain after each one that for those who received the benefits of his work teddy is your senator too the obvious problem what has barack obama done to remotely compare with any of that kennedys life and accomplishments whatever your political views simply dwarf obamas
7749288 whenever i feel like exercise i lie down until the feeling passes
7749289 and they would like to see that moral complexity acknowledged not swept aside
7749290 i think weve helped move the party in a new direction that opened up the tent a little wider but weve done it by acting as a broker helping progressives connect better with middle america
7749291 no unlocked storage card detected make sure an unlocked storage card is inserted and try again
7749292 we are very disappointed that the judge continues to discount evidence that financial disclosure is poor policy that would put officers and their families at risk while having no demonstrable positive outcomes
7749293 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state
7749294 there are quite a few that have gone to short sales and foreclosures prices are down
7749295 properties are beginning to move because prices have gone down
7749296 the east side of hawthorne is really bad because of defaults
7749297 i have never experienced a situation like this being two months without kicking a ball i just want to be fully recovered
7749298 i am not used to being sidelined i feel sad but the worst moment has already gone and i recognise that i must patient
7749299 i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7749300 we all realise that weve got to improve the standard
7749301 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
7749302 its impossible for me to know how many abortions ive had
7749303 if asked last week i would have confidently declared none now i dont know it depends on what the meaning of the word abortion is
7749304 would give a human being in utero status to the itty bitty zygote
7749305 this practice is an affront to health professionals and american women
7749306 a number of sports that didnt do so well will have learned lessons
7749307 and with consistent financing over the next four years well see them lift to medal success as well in 2012
7749308 it has been frustrating we almost hit the target but you dont get medals for coming close
7749309 we need to sit down and analyse properly the results
7749310 we need to look beneath the medal table at the number of finalists weve got
7749311 we also need to look at those sports that didnt deliver in the way we expected them to
7749312 once weve got that it gives us a platform it doesnt provide the medals
7749313 weve then got to have the athletes and the support structure to move forward but we need to have a strong funding base
7749314 when youre host nation as we saw with the chinese in beijing there is an inspirational factor that comes into play

7749328 hell man were all sort of riding in this slowly sinking ship together arent we
7749329 its a really intense festival atmosphere with a lot of parties
7749330 i wonder how many people who were going to vote for mccain are now going to vote for obama because they know that death cab likes him
7749331 a lot of these bands are preaching to the choir
7749332 the way that he gets here to the democratic nomination
7749333 if its change by itself he will fail change what change how change why
7749334 we are really excited as hull are in the premier league at home and its a little bit of repeating the history
7749335 for hull to be in the premier league is a massive achievement and for us to be in the championship with the squad weve got is remarkable when you look back at that day
7749336 if someone could have predicted that day where the two clubs would be today they would have deserved a lot of credit

7749339 political stability environmental quality hunger and poverty all have the same root
7749340 in the long run the solution to each is restoring the most basic of all resources the soil
7749341 the amount of carbon we can put into the soil is staggering
7749342 with eight billion people were going to have to start getting interested in soil
7749343 were simply not going to be able to keep treating it like dirt
7749344 the olympic moments that touch your heart and purify your soul belong to those who are fighting destiny triumphing over adversity or proving to the world that love can be as deep as ocean

7749356 obamas gr te herausforderung bei diesem parteitag wird es sein sich auf den mittelstand zu focussieren sich mit ihnen zu identifizieren
7749357 you definitely get worried when you see someone take a shot like the one he took last week
7749358 but he came back and played great tonight and showed that he is very capable of getting the job done
7749359 he looked real good he looked so good that he was making me look good
7749360 i was making my blocks id look up and he would be ten or fifteen yards up the field making me look better
7749361 we need to work on a few things but i thought it was a pretty good night
7749362 you think of him as an outside guy and catching it out of the backfield
7749363 i thought it was good for him to get in there with the first team and go he made some really good tough runs youre talking about a guy whos not very tall but pound for pound hes probably the toughest guy on the field hes strong and close to the ground and not easy to tackle
7749364 there are certain runs that hes very very comfortable with
7749365 well get lt back and playing and mix sproles and jacob i think were going to have a good group there
7749366 they are going to embrace everything there is about the flash not ignore it and i think the story lends itself to the whole flash legacy and how important barry is to it
7749367 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7749368 tests for perfect pitch have always demanded that subjects already have some musical training or at least familiarity with a particular piece of music which really limits the pool of candidates you can test
7749369 that means nobody really knew how prevalent perfect pitch is in humans in general
7749370 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
7749371 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
7749372 factors like wind and the angle of the sun had little bearing on how the animals stood
7749373 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7749374 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7749375 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask onto my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
7749376 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7749377 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7749378 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7749379 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 23 30 local french time
7749380 all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of ear ache
7749381 as a precaution limoges airport have arranged a local doctor to be available to any other passengers should they require
7749382 they were all so skinny they were all the same
7749383 it is the humanitarian communitys obligation to see that the humanitarian needs are fulfilled
7749384 the humanitarian community has not been able to fully support what was jointly established
7749385 it was a very short sighted strategy because they did not have the reserves to respond
7749386 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
7749387 so if you read from that you will know that if there is one force that the enemy would want to strike it would be the air force
7749388 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment
7749389 according to medical advice there is no longer sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of any vaccination

7749405 the convention exemplifies the true rot of our democracy the presidential race gets almost all of the attention and every other level of government gets none because we have come to believe democracy is just a quadrennial vote for president
7749406 a voting system used in 34 states contains a critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point the manufacturer acknowledges
7749407 russia did not want this crisis the russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically it did not need a little victorious war russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the georgian president mikheil saakashvili

7749409 the key question who finally triggered full conflict remains in dispute the georgians said they staged their offensive only after russian troops began streaming into south ossetia and the russians saying they advanced only after the georgians began attacking south ossetias capital tskhinvali
7749410 even assuming that airlines improve fuel efficiency by about 50 percent in such a scenario the united states could go from having nearly 400 primary airports down to 50 or so

7749412 the last two quarterly earnings seasons have shown testing times for the sri lankan banking sector
7749413 double whammy in terms of impacting consumer demand for credit and denting asset quality
7749414 with more of corporate consumers shifting into cost liability products and the timing mismatch between lending and liability re pricing we feel the banking sector profits will face testing times over the medium run
7749415 we began to worry about the situation in recent days because you are only buying diesel to an amount of 50 for us we have to transport raw material several kilometers per day it is a negligible quantity
7749416 whenever there is power cut the it companies and other commercial establishments start using generators this adds to diesel shortage and affects prices of vegetables and other commodities

7749426 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach dr larson said
7749427 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall and it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream

7749439 i can understand how it can be irritating to walk behind someone on the way to class and have smoke blown on them
7749440 but as a smoker i think its weird because youre outside if you are 25 feet away from buildings youre not going to hurt anyone it puts a ban on your freedom for your right to smoke or not
7749441 first and foremost we hope to achieve compliance through persuasion that this in fact good for the university and good for its citizens
7749442 so if people are repeatedly advised and chose to break the ban then therell be discipline systems for all of those things it is not any different from breaking any other rule

7749681 it is between michael and the club but in an ideal world we would all like his contract sorted out sooner rather than later
7749682 at the same time though he has got the rest of the season with his current contract
7749683 he has got a presence about him michael is a world renowned centre forward and a world renowned goalscorer when he leads us out it sends a message to other teams it tells them that we have some real quality in our side he is the most world renowned player we have at the club
7749684 he is not a ranter and raver in the dressing room everyone knows that but he doesnt have to be his presence is enough and the aura that he carries with him if you are playing against michael owen you know you are playing one of the best in the world
7749685 we have some other good players as well but seeing michael on that team sheet sends out a message he is special centre forwards get judged on goals and he is one of the best at hitting the back of the net
7749686 if he does nothing else in the game but still scores that is enough michael is a top class player and you know what you are going to get
7749687 he grabs important goals and he has done that again with the winner against bolton he only trained a couple of days last week so he deserves credit for just being on the bench
7749688 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves

7749699 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers

7749748 kinerja agen penjual kurang yang dilihat dari kecilnya jumlah pesanan ori005 dalam 3 hari sampai jumat kemarin
7749749 kita tahu kondisi likuiditas sedang ketat dan bank juga saat ini menawarkan rate deposito yang tinggi jadi kondisinya seperti itu saat ini
7749750 nah setelah kita kirim surat itu sampai tanggal 25 malem kemarin kenaikan jumlah pemesanan biasanya rp 300 miliar sudah menjadi rp 500 miliar jadi kita harapkan ada multiplier effect dari situ

7749754 we have selected 10 spots in the city where these services will be made available for around 2 000 customers of the rs 750 plan within two km of the 10 bts that are 3g enabled customers will be able to access 3g services there will be no additional cost for the time being as we are in the trail period customers will be able to access 3g services at 2g rates
7749755 we have been asked to design the equipment for 20 per cent of the customer base
7749756 the cost of the services will depend upon the auction of the spectrum the number of people opting for 3g services will also matter but it will still be expensive if the spectrum is auctioned at a high price
7749757 in the apec countries the costs are over 20 30 per cent higher than 2g services
7749758 spain were incredible it will go down as one of the greatest olympic games ever every possession mattered you guys felt the intensity so you know how crazy it was for us
7749759 all these guys committed to jerry colangelo three year ago and said they wanted to be part of a team
7749760 we wanted one collective ego weve not had one problem for the coaching team its been the great experience of my life
7749761 we knew spain were going to be a big problem
7749762 they played an incredible game and showed why theyre the world champions but this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place everyone wants to talk about the us players being individuals and arrogant but this was a team and we came out with a big win
7749763 barack obama steht f r den wandel den wir brauchen
7749764 nichts nichts konnte mich davon abhalten zu diesem ganz speziellen parteitag heute abend zu kommen
7749765 wir sind geeint und wir stehen zusammen und sind entschlossen
7749766 aziel faison really stepped up he is a special back and david highsmith rushed for 120 yards thats depth in the backfield like we havent had before
7749767 the green hope kids played hard and steve katz is doing a great job coaching them but it isnt a great team now
7749768 you cant win with seven turnovers against a really great team
7749769 he played at an intensity level that ive never seen matched
7749770 i feel very blessed to have the chance to coach him
7749771 say dont you remember they called me al it was al all the time
7749772 i think people need to be educated to the fact that marijuana is not a drug
7749773 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7749774 and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7749775 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7749776 and i know someone else whos been inspired all over again by senator obama in our family hes known as uncle teddy more than any senator of his generation or perhaps any generation teddy has made life better for people in this country and around the world
7749777 for 46 years he has been so much more than just a senator for the people of massachusetts hes been a senator for all who believe in a dream thats never died
7749778 john mccain has spent more than 25 years in washington voting against womens freedom
7749779 and has pledged to appoint justices to the supreme court who will overturn roe v wade
7749780 republicans say john mccain has experience we say john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7749781 if you are hurt you forgive us lets write together a chapter of the new pakistan i admit that you are hurt we apologize for tha t
7749782 for the sake of democracy for the sake of pakistan
7749783 you come along with us in this test and we will come with you in the next test
7749784 important part of what im about what makes me tick
7749785 very supportive as soon as he saw what was happening he and i we connect on many levels i mean he knew immediately that i would want to go ive been to georgia with him i know the country
7749786 shes on the phone with the world food programme hes on the phone with saakashvili
7749787 it was a great picture of what theyll be like in the white house
7749788 theres a very serious land mine issue now because there are land mines being laid as we speak
7749789 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now
7749790 we went basically as an emergency team not knowing what wed be getting into
7749791 we discovered as did the kuwaitis that the iraqis had planted land mines in the playgrounds so we hadnt been there 12 hours and the first case we get is a young child who had gone outside to play on the teeter totter and stepped on a land mine that was my first experience with land mines
7749792 when people begin to run they run for places that they know are safe schools churches community centers and those are the first things that are mined
7749793 when i was 15 i used to watch match of the day and say im just as good as these players or better
7749794 and hes pretty much laid low with me those guys out there ought to be afraid
7749795 because he takes it to another level to entertain in the clubhouse weve tried to tell them
7749796 thats one of the reasons were able to do this with eddie we know him look out rookies i guarantee it
7749797 thats one area we think we can help out give them another arm for guys who are overworked
7749798 its eddie he takes the ball does his gyrations and says here it comes this time of year you have to want the ball you cant back away eddie does not back away from anything
7749799 hes a veteran laid back guy we play at a different level
7749800 if that was a problem i wish someone had told me
7749801 i would have thrown stuff if i needed to i would have thrown stuff in spring training
7749802 he was very complimentary of the situation of the organization and appreciated the opportunity to go back to the twins

7749804 we shall always look at warsaw prague and budapest as great european cities
7749805 they have said whatever the wisdom or lack of it of georgias actions that is not a justification for a powerful neighbour to invade a small sovereign country russias pretext there we have the nub of it i wonder what they think the russians should have done and what they think any other country would have done in similar circumstances
7749806 this article is shallow it does not suggest any answers
7749807 we should also learn the lessons of 1914 when power blocks glower at each other trivial local problems can quickly escalate
7749808 did the czechs use artillery to kill hundreds of russian civilians
7749809 we may need russian gas but russia needs our market
7749810 is not ajustification for a powerfull neighbour to invade a small sovereign country
7749811 russias pretext that it has a right to step in militarily to protect its citizens
7749812 that we must be strong and vigilant in defence of our values and not look the other way when a small independent country is invaded by its neighbour
7749813 we should not accept that while the czech republic poland and the baltic states are in nato and the eu with their full measure of independence and liberty

7749816 i thought it was just going to be a little car that putt putted around
7749817 the first time i saw him race in it he was going like 30 mph
7749818 love does not seek its own interests it is not quick tempered it does not brood over injury it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things
7749819 it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
7749820 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
7749821 there is an agreement between both sides that no foreign soldiers will be in iraq after 2011
7749822 must be based on a specific deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces and that it should not be open
7749823 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7749824 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7749825 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7749826 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be
7749827 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7749828 i looked across the table and there was joey maybe 5 10 5 9
7749829 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7749830 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
7749831 there were other options but i think for the long term and whats in the best interest of jgr the home depot and our whole team joey was the guy
7749832 racing is a lot of little things that make it every time i go to the racetrack i learn things as long as i pick up something every time i go to the racetrack its going to be great
7749833 weve had a great 10 years weve got some pretty good stats to set our goals at right now and to use that as our motivating tools in the future weve got to win at least three next year like we did in 99
7749834 its like somebodys out there all night with a tractor
7749835 i just shot at them in their rears and they all took off
7749836 obama will lose to mccain unless he overhauls his message of change
7749837 the way that he gets here to the democratic nomination
7749838 if its change by itself he will fail change what change how change why
7749839 dewey redman enters with a shattering roar literally screaming while playing the saxophone the earth opens up and you contemplate the multitudes of strange large brown insects that burrow and feed near the ancient runes
7749840 in my world thats the first thing i reach for is the sound technique is ok but if you got the technique and i got a good sound ill beat you every time you can play a thousand notes and i can play one note and wipe you out thats what i reach for is a sound
7749841 all nick ever talks about are his mom and dad
7749842 his dad was his heart his guy his best friend
7749843 when i first went to ghana the u s dollar was about five to six times the cedi ghanas currency
7749844 this was a real problem for ghana because to carry around anything real substantial you would need to have an envelope full of money since then they have made considerable changes to reduce the inflation to the point where it is practically equivalent to ours in the u s
7749845 i think well all be really happy to see whats there
7749846 its such a good precedent for people who are developing properties uptown and not just putting up a plain building but putting in something that adds to the interest of the historic district uptown
7749847 from the outside itll look like two separate buildings but its actually one building
7749848 the rules and regulations of the apartment are still being tweaked are going through planning commission and will be coming to oxford city council
7749849 but were now saying there will be one person per every 200 square feet
7749850 the owners of the first financial bank lot asked for release of providing commercial on the first floor so its just going to be residential
7749851 man how did you get so smart at what sixteen
7749852 anything worth doing member aiaa nra aclu sas lp is worth doing for money
7749853 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
7749854 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
7749855 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title
7749856 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder
7749857 certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7749858 chelsea were very strong last week and united will be even stronger than they are now if they sign dimitar berbatov from tottenham as i think they will in the next few days
7749859 weve been a good team over the past two seasons and im confident well be a decent team again
7749860 i went in at half time feeling quite pleased with us but we ran out of steam in the second half and people like carlos tevez and wayne rooney just popped the ball about when the heat went out of the game
7749861 we are a new team with a few players just getting over injuries and once we play a bit more and get to understand each other we will be okay
7749862 it was a bonus win we only drew here last season and we lost the season before that it is never an easy place to come but i thought we played good football
7749863 we had to play a pretty tight midfield unit without much width but it is good we wont slip too far behind what with having no league game next weekend
7749864 ramadan and eid are the only muslim holidays compared to the so many they had when they werent muslim yet many times the dont have anyone to spend it with because their families are still not muslim
7749865 if one is following a madhab they should look at other opinions if there is a maslaha in those issues for example it is harder to gain khushoo in salaah if one is not looking down yet the maliki opinion is to look straight forward in salaah he said to forego the maliki opinion if one is maliki and to look down also if you are hanafi and pray behind an imam you should still recite something silently even though it is not the opinion of the school because one can lose concentration easily if one is just standing there silent and not engaged
7749866 he also said to keep a diary for spiritual development and self auditing and to focus on one bad habit to break this ramadan such as useless talk gheeba or eating too much
7749867 we my children and i learned about balancing islamic activism and piety my children pointed out that they have a better understanding of tazkiyah
7749868 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
7749869 all men are not created equal it is the purpose of the government to make them so
7749870 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7749871 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7749872 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7749873 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7749874 coach turner made the perfect call and billy threw it in just the right place
7749875 the guy completes a 20 yard 25 yard ball that shouldnt end up being a touchdown we didnt tackle well i was disappointed that down on the goal line we had a chance to get it in we dont get it in on first down and then we have a botched snap
7749876 sometimes you just need to get a rhythm going a little bit
7749877 we were able to do that in the second quarter and move it up and down the field
7749878 i thought after the first drive our energy level picked up a great deal
7749879 theyre a very very good offensive team our guys rallied back and i thought for a lot of the game we played good defense
7749880 he brings a dimension he brought to this team two years ago and its exciting for me to see him playing the way he is
7749881 hes going to be a part of what we do
7749882 to me thats always the theme at this time of year and throughout the entire season there are things that we will take from this game that will help us play better on opening day
7749883 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7749884 cand echipa joaca slab si castiga acesta este un semn bun

7749888 we have taken the opportunity to assemble a team of emerging talent and players who will benefit from the experience of touring and playing in australia and india
7749889 the tour is helping to build the experience of these players and is part of a programme to build greater depth at the international level
7749890 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7749891 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7749892 de aval por las cantidades entregadas a cuenta por haber confiado en el nombre de la empresa
7749893 ese aval lo he solicitado desde febrero de este a o recibiendo s lo largas incluso lo reclam un d a antes de la suspensi n de pagos v a burofax aunque no me ha servido de nada
7749894 inmobiliaria puede rescindir el contrato por el incumplimiento de una de las partes
7749895 deber an haber terminado ya para entregarnos la vivienda en diciembre y sin embargo justo antes del concurso de acreedores la constructora se sali de la obra y ya no sabemos nada m s
7749896 estamos pagando y no tenemos casa y queremos la vivienda ya que no podemos recuperar el dinero y si la dejamos nos penalizan porque es protegida
7749897 hacer un frente com n para presionar en el concurso de acreedores porque sabemos que somos una promoci n jugosa al estar pr cticamente acabada y todos los abogados quieren cazarnos y ninguno nos aporta una soluci n concreta
7749898 en una urbanizaci n sin terminar en la que las zonas comunes se han convertido en un sello de correos porque martinsa fadesa se sac de la manga un apartahotel una vez que las viviendas estaban vendidas
7749899 el problema que tenemos la mayor a de los afectados que tenemos avales es que las aseguradoras nos dicen que como la empresa est en concurso de acreedores no nos pagan hasta que no se resuelva y eso no es as porque el seguro est precisamente para eso
7749900 aunque nuestra situaci n es la menos mala porque sabemos que tarde o temprano vamos a cobrar lo que queremos es pillar el dinero y largarnos
7749901 hay una desprotecci n legal absoluta porque por qu tengo yo que acudir a un abogado cuando estoy reclamando lo que la ley dice que me pertenece
7749902 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7749903 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7749904 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7749905 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7749906 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7749907 defensively i think we have the capability of having not only one of the top defenses in the mac but a defense that is ranked nationally
7749908 youve got three all mac type players that you can build your defense around
7749909 weve got to come out and develop an identity early
7749910 when you play a team from the sec theyre going to be a physical football team it means theyre going to be very well coached weve got to make sure we get out to a great start
7749911 each year i intentionally design our pre mac competitive schedule to test our athletes in every way possible to better position miami to earn regional and national recognition while fully preparing ourselves for the top competition we will contend with weekly in our conference race
7749912 we have an opportunity this fall to face new opponents from out of the region for the first time and to defeat other good teams within our region who were highly ranked in 2007
7749913 the girls really felt that the game was in their hands this year the motivating piece would be to leave nothing to chance
7749914 i think that has been an area of concern legitimately
7749915 with her help and guidance that position in particular is going to get the attention it needs
7749916 they want to be great and that is exciting for me i love working with people of that kind of ambition
7749917 too many people focus on results and not enough people focus on what needs to be done to get there
7749918 we want work as hard as we possibly can in every single game that we play these are the things that need to be in place before we can even discuss what outcome we want to achieve
7749919 we can only control our own effort and our own attitude
