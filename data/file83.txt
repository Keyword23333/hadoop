830005 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
830006 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
830007 we are going to be in this for the long haul
830008 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight
830009 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
830010 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
830011 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
830012 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
830013 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
830014 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
830015 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
830016 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
830017 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
830018 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
830019 there is a considerable volume of material that needs to be digested
830020 we know older homeless people arent accessing mainstream services in their true numbers
830021 thats because they believe mostly correctly that existing homeless services dont address their complex needs
830022 another common reason is because they feel too proud or independent to use them
830023 so their numbers and the scale of the problem are going undetected
830024 if older homeless people are slipping under the radar of traditional homeless services then its fair to say their presence is registering as zero with the wider community
830025 these are the key issues thats why well be making sure that anyone who breaks those and faces prosecution when they are prosecuted they will be put on this website

830076 regarding the variant reading of jude 5 there are a number of differences one encounters when dealing with the greek text of jude 5 i would like to list the variant reading and the manuscripts that support them before i tell why i chose the reading over
830077 the reason that i chose over was because i felt it to be the reading with the strongest manuscript support as well as the difficult reading
830078 and if i have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have all faith so as to remove mountains but have not love i am nothing

830120 i always have been and i wanted to put my skills to use serving my community
830121 we were in a moment of empowerment we were at the zenith of changing the world
830122 that was a nazi symbol used against queers the way the star of david was used against jews
830123 it still represents homosexuals as victims of murder and hatred
830124 a true flag is not about design its torn from the soul of the people we all own the rainbow flag
830125 we needed something to express who we were as a sexual liberation movement we are every gender we are every race we are every class
830126 and rainbows have been used cross culturally and historically as symbols of hope they are magical
830127 those who think it doesnt matter are speaking from a place of privilege perhaps theyve never had to fight or sacrifice for their rights
830128 flags are not a solution in and of themselves and they are not as important as being truthful to ourselves
830129 historically a very tolerant nation and was once so liberal in its acceptance of humankind immaterial of race creed or sexuality
830130 it was only after the british moved into ceylon now sri lanka in 1814 that a more rigid system of sexual licensing was introduced and homosexuality was criminalized
830131 they proceeded to amend this law to include women as well sri lanka is probably the only country that has done so most other asian countries that were at one point colonies of the british empire still uphold these outdated sodomy laws but none have amended the law to include women
830132 in 2004 i helped set up equal ground a nonprofit organization seeking political rights for the lgbtiq community in sri lanka we want to encourage everyone to stand up with pride and be counted and to pass on all the information we have to create a community educated in gay issues who know what their rights are as human beings
830133 being a gay man is difficult enough without the added burden of being openly out in a country that has a 10 year jail sentence attached to it
830134 just stemmed from our work with the community we needed to create safe spaces for the queer community to come out to to celebrate who they are and for at least one day be free to express themselves as gay men and women we planned a party at a popular nightclub in town and organized adequate security just in case we had trouble we anticipated that only a handful of people would turn up but we had over three hundred
830135 every year since then the numbers have grown pride for us here in sri lanka is now a week long celebration of who we are
830136 we have still not been able to get on to the streets and march most of the queer population lives in fear but one day soon we will
830137 a day on the beach in colombo where we gather and fly our rainbow kites over the city and make our statement that the queer community is no longer hiding or lurking in the dark we are out and proud of who we are and we demand our rights as human beings
830138 its easy its even fun to be gay in new york or vancouver but try being gay in a place with a criminal sentence attached
830139 our fight for equality and freedom is not over until every queer person around the world is free to live and love who they want to
830140 that people have forgotten why we celebrate pride why we get on the streets for pride why we shout to be heard and what pride is all about
830141 most of the western world is enjoying the benefits of civil partnership laws and marriage they might not feel the need to campaign to protest to demand from our governments what is rightfully ours
830142 most queer communities in the world are still fighting for the decriminalization of homosexuality people around the world are still being tortured and stoned and killed for being queer
830143 but hidden somewhere in this discussion is the notion that the psychiatrist is somehow responsible in a medicolegal way for the consequences of someones mental illness via its management or lack thereof our society has often placed us in this role and it is not one i enjoy or desire
830144 accepting a life in which i would need to not stress myself

830209 i was astounded to learn that google had been ordered to disclose certain youtube information which includes users login ids and ip addresses for use in viacoms copyright infringement lawsuit against youtube
830210 failed to consider that user login ids and video viewing habits can reveal a great deal of sensitive personal information
830211 simply stripping certain data fields from a database is not sufficient to safeguard the privacy of individuals
830212 the majority of instances of identity theft result from insider abuse
830213 while i have sympathy for the rights of intellectual property holders businesses should not rely on the surveillance of consumers to protect their copyright interests it is not acceptable to allow copyright enforcement to come at the expense of users privacy

830217 the more data youve got the more data thats going to be there as an attractive kind of treasure chest for outside parties
830218 this decision makes it absolutely clear that everywhere we go online we leave tracks and every piece of information we access online leaves some sort of record

830375 today we are facing a situation where the worlds we are going to inhabit the worlds where we conduct our social and business lives is principally being organized by engineers with no serious background in the humanities
830376 i dont like the way youre doing that and i dont like your principles and beliefs so i am going to pigeon hole you invent a group that you belong to fic technocrats et al and then nail you for associating with that group even though it only exists in my own mind mostly because i am simply intimidated by a things i dont understand and b people who i am worried might be intelligent but who gasp chose a different path than full on humanities

830388 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
830389 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
830390 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
830391 there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to iraq
830392 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
830393 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
830394 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
830395 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
830396 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

830405 what attracted me to the role is that the people of somaliland want a good relationship with israel and the western countries
830406 somaliland has oil minerals and a huge tourist potential benefiting from the red sea ports being in such a strategic position could make it a very helpful and powerful ally for israel and the friendship between israel and somaliland could be very important strategically for other countries
830407 it is surrounded by unfriendly neighbours and compares its struggle for independence to israels in 1948 the people are not interested in extremism it is a peaceful country
830408 while fashion may be artsy artistic artful enjoying an art infused moment and even gasp influential in certain art circles its not art
830409 the conventional wisdom was that fashion was the enemy of art

830415 he accepts that they the offences are mean spirited and nasty because they preyed on the good spirit of others he is an orthodox jew so it is to his increased shame that he targeted other jews
830416 they were committed at a time when he was desperate and lost and at the lowest ebb of his life his gambling has given him nothing but misery and these were crimes from which he derived no pleasure at all
830417 when his wife was phoned with news of his arrest she was driving she was so shocked that she crashed into a tree
830418 it was very serious and she was in a coma and has only just been released from hospital this preys on his conscience
830419 he is at rock bottom he has no visitors because he has no friends or family here he doesnt feel able to socialise and has been targeted as he is conspicuously a religious man
830420 he is suffering death by a thousand cuts with these repeated hearings

830434 mass circumcision campaigns will result in hundreds of thousands of complications and could make the hiv crisis worse
830435 there are already numerous reports of males lining up to get circumcised so they no longer will need to use condoms
830436 male circumcision is a dangerous distraction in the hiv battle even if circumcision does offer some degree of reduced risk per sexual incident individuals engaged in high risk behavior are still at risk for hiv and circumcision does not protect women giving circumcised males and their partners the false impression that they are protected will make the situation worse by increasing risk taking behavior further mass circumcision campaigns will likely overwhelm the already overburdened african healthcare infrastructure and divert resources away from other needed and more effective hiv prevention strategies

830460 unfortunately we have seen a lot of talk from the pakistani side and less action we are hoping that they will walk the talk it is a time to implement
830461 the prime ministers strong words against the extremists and terrorists
830462 we talked about the need for us to make sure that the afghan border is secure as best as possible
830463 these actions further undermine human rights and the peaceful olympics called for by the authorities and reflect an irresponsible callousness towards the sichuan earthquake victims

830466 one of al qaedas top chemical and biological weapons experts was killed in an air strike by a cia pilotless drone
830467 the fact he trained them himself shows you some of the limitations of the network
830468 the intel was solid they knew who the guys were and where exactly they were in the compound but they passed to get them another time
830469 right military force was ineffective thats why al qaeda is beaten

830480 there is a need to expand treatment to those who do not yet have treatment
830481 the nude athletes would parade like peacocks up and down the stadium poets would write in a shaky hand these wonderful odes to the bodies of the young men their skin the color of fired clay but other cultures like the persians and the egyptians looked at these greek men oiling one another down and writhing in the mud and found it very strange they believed it promoted sexual degeneracy

830484 do you know the taliban entered kandahar city and broke into the prison
830485 there were armored vehicles on the hill and they were firing there was a heavy bombardment and planes bombed too
830486 they did not differentiate between the guilty and not guilty
830487 we left our houses because we had no power to resist the taliban or the government
830488 anytime the taliban fired a shot from our houses then the coalition the government and the police came to the area and hit us
830489 the government comes and arrests us and then the taliban come and arrest us as well
830490 there was fighting in the village a hundred times roadside bombs bombardment firing and shooting
830491 the taliban are coming during the night with heavy weapons riding on vehicles and we cannot even dare ask them to leave because if they see someone at night outside they will slaughter them and accuse them of being spies
830492 his mother was cooking and he was lying beside her
830493 the whole village was destroyed and after that we left

830749 if we think about the wal mart model it is incredibly fuel intensive at every stage and at every one of those stages we are now seeing an inflation of the costs for boats trucks cars

830756 the level of job advertisements remains at high levels particularly internet ads and in july the overall rate of decline has slowed

830810 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
830811 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage
830812 it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
830813 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
830814 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good

830819 i wouldnt say were concerned about qantas safety at all in fact weve found no evidence of safety slipping within the airline or safety standards being allowed to drop at all
830820 but if things happen we need to be flexible and proactive and respond to those concerns and thats what were doing
830821 obviously events like manila where we had the aircraft depressurise they were an entirely different kind of a normal run of business things that are being reported almost daily
830822 qantas safety standards are so high and so well recognised that when we do have an accident like the other day with ojk the aircraft in manila its big news and were not afraid of the scrutiny
830823 this time last year the talk was of india decoupling from the troubles of the rest of the world economy now its clear that india has its own problems it has gone from hero to zero
830824 just as many forecasters and markets were too optimistic in 2005 07 effectively running with the view that whatever china could do india could do better there are now some that are suggesting that it can do nothing right
830825 many clients have often regarded this projection as a fact
830826 given the inflation challenge the fiscal and current account position one might say oil prices are the most critical thing for india in the next six months or so

830857 ini telahpun dimaklumi oleh dsai amp pimpinan pakatan rakyat malahan dsai dalam pidatonya di kulim menyatakan bersedia bertanding di kbb setelah mahkamah mengisytiharkan kbb kosong
830858 maka pimpinan pkr telah mengadakan mesyuarat tergempar dan memutuskan pilihanraya kecil perlu dibuat segera bagi mereka menunggu 19 ogos mungkin akan terlambat nanti sebab itulah keputusan dibuat mengosongkan kerusi permatang pauh serta merta untuk membolehkan pilihanraya kecil diadakan segera
830859 namun mereka kekal dengan keputusan tersebut walaupun saya sangat sedih namun tetap akur dengan keputusan pimpinan tersebut
830860 ini kerana saya sebagai peguam tahu tidak mungkin tangkapan amp pertuduhan akan dikenakan terhadap dsai dalam 48 jam kerana peguam negara belum pun menerima kertas siasatan dari pihak polis dan apabila menerimanya pun pihak ag perlu menapis amp menganalisa semua keterangan amp bukti yang dikemukakan polis sudah tentu ini memerlukan masa apatah lagi timbul isu lapuran pusrawi yang kelihatannya saperti menidakkan berlaku liwat sudah tentu pihak ag akan menyiasat dengan lebih teliti

830878 kent surprised many with a different kind of commitment speech
830879 i told my mom i was going to learn from my mistake become a more positive person and show people that wasnt my real style
830880 i made a commitment to do the little things for people that are not expected and just to become a better person and son i made a commitment to my mother that one mistake was not going to bring me down and that i would correct my image for her
830881 i told my teammates i knew i was personally ranked high on the scouting services but realized the importance of teamwork this summer during camps
830882 i told them when i did one on one drills and was locked up on an island covering faster wide receivers the qbs had all the time to throw and i didnt look as great without my d line there to pressure the pass
830883 i let my coaches know that i was making a commitment to bringing it every day to practice and to being the leader that they need
830884 i made a promise i would help our team win and take our program to the next level
830885 i committed to miami because it just felt like home the moment i stepped on campus i loved the atmosphere

830892 amy is one of the premier track and field coaches in collegiate athletics since being hired at um in 1990 she has continually distinguished herself both as a leader of student athletes and through the accomplishments of her teams i am confident that she will bring those skills to her new duties and continue to bring distinction to the university of miami
830893 i want to thank president shalala and kirby for giving me such a tremendous opportunity and showing confidence in my ability to lead both the mens and womens programs
830894 the schedule is set up nicely for a run at the sec title and the national title
830895 and miami has a long way to go before it regains elite status
830896 to win one national championship 1989 is amazing for guys to win their second 1991 in three years that hasnt been accomplished by many thats what makes this championship special and it came in a situation where we had not been picked to be that good some people said wed be no 3 in the state of florida
830897 what is worse they underestimate the canes with false and therefore imaginary perceptions false
830898 theres nothing else to say i didnt make the kick what is there to say i didnt make the kick nothing else to say
830899 i dont know what it is but im glad we got it
830900 it feels great to beat anyone but its especially sweet to beat your biggest rival maybe its a mystique some kind of a curse i know its always in the back of their kickers mind
830901 what you had was two great defenses there and it really came down to who made the fewest mistakes is going to win
830902 if wed kicked that ball through the goal post wed have been all right
830903 it feels great to beat anyone but its especially sweet to beat your biggest rival maybe its a mystique some kind of a curse
830904 i ate so much of it that im coming back in my next life re incarnated as it
830905 i have no idea who the players are in jax
830906 now you look at the players oscar cryer is brining in they have talent but are they team 1st type guys and is cryer creating the environment to help guys see team 1st than when you got a backstabbing headcoach a liar and a propagandan biotch azz coach what kind of environment is e really creating and when players who come into that program who need real guidance he cant give it to them because of his own character
830907 thats why you dont here shannon and company preaching that shat theyll preach things like we got a lot of guys who been and still are in the nfl but thats not what you need to look at what were going to do is show you what they did to get their so your focus needs to be in this level not the next level because if you take care of this than when that comes youll already be ready see this is foundation um recruiting we never had to sell people all these pipe dreams guys truly already played the game for the love of it you hear the coaches in the nfl talk about guys who played at um think about all the 1st round draft picks you already know theyre paid but ive never heard a guy from um being looked at as being a player that only wants money we know were going to get the money along the way but more than anything we wont to be the best champions
830908 get your facts straight again cav cooper only reopened when coker was fired are you serious
830909 coker sealed the deal with our two potentially best offensive players franklin and cooper no what your talking about
830910 harvin hazelton davis from rutgers and so on dropped us before coker even got a chance remember soldinger was the one who couldnt deliver peterson so know wtf you are talking about
830911 im not for sure yet where ill go its the dead period so i cant talk to coaches
830912 my dad will help me decide hes not pushing me to anyone just says go where i feel most comfortable
830913 miamis still in the picture theyve never been out of the picture
830914 coach shannon has checked up on me all the time is making sure everythings still good
830915 now that i have my test i have to concentrate on which school i want to go to
830916 the teammates those boys love me there they treat me like im already on the team there i love all those guys
830917 lets get our stinger back and have a great second half
830918 when you sit down and evaluate youre playing 10 freshmen your first year as a head coach
830919 thats seventh graders playing against 12th graders thats going to be tough to win games that way
830920 cut that out cav lol that had to be the most ridiculous speech i ever heard yet and than but more importantly it didnt move the players at all if anything it made them either madder like wtf ishe talking about or laugh which we didnt need at that time
830921 when you sit down and evaluate youre playing 10 freshmen your first year as a head coach
830922 thats seventh graders playing against 12th graders thats going to be tough to win games that way
830923 its going to take a vision its going to take hard work i dont think any fans by any stretch of the imagination are into the 10 year plan but i think theyre clearly understanding that youve got to recruit athletes and youve got to retain your coaching staff

830930 i called and let coach barrow know and now im waiting to hear back from a few other guys ill be in my suite with thearon collier and kendall thompkins later this week im excited coach told me to come in ready because he thinks i can make a real impact on special teams
830931 im still looking at them but not as much as i was they havent stayed in contact much
830932 i think the seminole showcase and the summer camp on consecutive days really helped
830933 florida state is trying to change the perception of the program behind the efforts of jimbo fisher and james coley they are reaching out to recruits more and trying to relay that desire to win in turn these players are getting excited and they want to play for the coaches
830934 i dont think this coaching staff wants to spend the fall months trying to grab 20 players
830935 they spent the last two offseasons evaluating the guys in this class and now they want to build excitement with their commitments by having success on the field again
830936 they are definitely going to wait on guys like seminole receiver andre debose and alabama recruit dre kirkpatrick
830937 i think the fsu tie with current glades central coach jesse hester helped here jimbo fisher has really put an emphasis on recruiting in the muck and he loves the players from glades central and pahokee henry was originally an lsu commit but with the economy the way it is his family was looking at spending a lot of money to travel to games but at fsu hes closer to home and he fits a major need for the seminoles i believe hes one of the elite linemen in the state along with naples nick alajajian and south lakes jonotthan harris he can come in and get an opportunity to play right away
830938 lonnie had been a heavy fsu lean so this might have been a strategical move to have get this final surge rolling i love him as a player and a person fsu has made a lot of mistakes over the past few years and recruited a lot of players who had character issues lonnie is a natural leader and he has an infectious personality that will rub off on everyone around him hes always smiling hes always positive and hes in the mold of those high character guys like warrick dunn and charlie ward you can never have enough guys like lonnie pryor and 2008 commitment jermaine thomas on your team you dont have to worry about these kids in the classroom or getting in trouble off the field hes got superstar potential
830939 xavier like lonnie pryor was a heavy fsu lean and i think thats why he lost some luster with these recruit ranking websites
830940 in the past fsu and miami always recruited the undersized speedsters but now its about getting bigger faster and stronger
830941 they are recruiting men instead of kids who need to develop its going to show in the way they attack teams over the next few seasons
830942 get him in the weight room and hell be 220
830943 if shields is ineligible ums passing game may be worse than it was last season when it ranked 108th nationally
830944 who knows more about what makes canes football tick me or randy shannon
830945 we never got an answer to the player s from yesterday jay brophy 53 julio cortes 99 kevin fagan 95 ogv had two out of three but missed on brophy by one digit 53 not 54
830946 me and luther robinson are going to come in and do our thing coach hurtt said were going to be the two tackles he takes
830947 this idiot gaytor calls you ignorant and yet says nothing to dispute your comment i guess mindlessly putting down a guy for his opinion is better than giving an intelligent counter opinion good job dum dum you represent the cousin kissing mullet having jort wearing natty lite drinking gayturds with the classlessness that most have come to expect from the toothless wonders from hogtown now scoot on back to your dumptruck and collect the garbage
830948 not sure how he did against auburn but that is only one game not every wr te has a good game every game ingram is a threat he is big target and not scared to go over the middle
830949 fsu is going to be awful this year they have no depth on the oline weatherford is the equivalent to our kyle wright lots of promise killer mistakes 6 and 6 at best plus with the possible ncaa investigation over their heads lots of their verbals are soft ones with kids still waiting for the results
830950 you cant be over aggressive like you can in high school i had to learn to be more patient
830951 i am a nasty aggressive player that always finds a way to get the job done but most of all i am a team player stats to me are just numbers the only thing that i really care about is wins and losses
830952 i love that offer oh yeah i was surprised they are the no 1 football program in the country and the defense is top notch you cant beat it plus the academics are crazy up there they are an all around team and the school has everything there is nothing florida doesnt have
830953 the coaches are friends forever they are so down to earth and straight forward coach meyer is the best person hes so cool and funny
830954 you never know how far you can go until youve gone to far
830955 canes from the past 59 arthur kehoe 61 donald bailey 12 jim kelly 83 jim burt sr and some bad azz linebacker 66 nicholas last name
830956 we wouldve loved for them to stay exactly where they were unfortunately they didnt
830957 we spent some time on it this spring just simply because it was so new that you didnt want to wait till the week of the game and say ok weve got three days lets try to get everybody on the same page so some of the nuances of some of things that are coming some of things that notre dame does things that uconn does things that rutgers does things that georgia tech is going to do we spent some time on each of those during our spring practice just so there might be a little be of familiarity and a little bit of carry over when we got to those specific games this fall
830958 i think it will probably be about the same to be honest with you i think what youll see is a lot more consistency with the clock operators i think the pace of the game will be faster it will very similar to the pace in pro football games
830959 well its already in vogue a great deal the minute someone throws an incomplete pass the hurry up offense slows down because now they have to rethink what they are going to do if you can get them off track itll slow them down a little bit
830960 yes he is t j kind of got the green light back around the first week or so of june so hes been pretty much throwing all summer we started him off on somewhat of a pitch count where every other day he was throwing 15 20 balls then he went to 30 35 40 then by july 4 they just said throw all you want to throw
830961 there is a lot that we wouldve loved for him to be able to do it was obviously important to get him healthy but you know anytime youve got a quarterback that starts 12 games youre anxious to see ok take that experience and now lets find out what you can build on top of that we missed that opportunity with him he took a lot of mental reps and he watched a ton of film but there is no substitute for being out there with the receivers and running the offense
830962 itll be interesting to find out because he missed all of spring i think mentally and cerebrally hes evolved some because hes watched an awful lot of film this summer of course that was the only way he could challenge himself to try to get better hopefully well find during training camp how much he has evolved hes bigger now hes stronger now because those were the only things he could work on was lifting hopefully hell be a little bit more durable than he was last season
830963 im a one qb guy i think you absolutely have to have a second guy ready and i think that what we found out was that cam sexton and mike paulus by taking all the reps in the spring time they got a tremendous amount of work what it did with our football team is i think that they saw them in a different light they know now t js one injury away from one of these two guys coming in the respect that they had the huddle presence they had i think that makes a big difference for them coming into a game
830964 the leadership thing and also the way in which no two quarterbacks are going to be absolutely identical each one of them is going to have a strength and youre going to want to play to that players strength so those are things you practice and things you have more confidence in doing ive never been any place where two guys were absolutely identical when we had bernie kosar and vinnie testaverde they were two great quarterbacks two guys that had long careers in the nfl but they were totally opposite
830965 as you recruit your own players there is a lot less experimentation because youve already gone through that mental exercise while youre recruiting you may look at them and say this is what he plays in high school but as soon as he gets here for us he is going to play this position so from the very first day you put them where you think theyre going to be
830966 it is what it is its a compliment and it will give us something to shoot for
830967 i hope they voted for our team best i can tell they arent going to let me play in any one of these games next year so i hope its for our team
830968 he had no hesitation whatsoever to look at the big picture of a program whether it was the dallas cowboys going 1 15 or in miami or wherever we were together and saying in a short amount of time this is the evaluation were rotten were terrible weve got no talent and were going to get rid of herschel walker because we need an influx of talent and the only way to get it we got to get more picks he would pull the trigger in a heartbeat and i appreciated the opportunity to learn a lot of that from him
830969 well when we were recruiting him when i got in we only had like 40 days before national signing day so i didnt get a chance to see an enormous amount of film on any of the kids we signed in that first recruiting class
830970 we tried the running back by committee we tried four or five guys all during spring practice and probably the tell tell sign was that nobody emerged which meant that instead of maybe having three or four that could play we probably didnt have anybody that could play
830971 i regret to this day because we might have went to a bowl game last year that we didnt pull the trigger because we talked about it in staff meetings if you watched our games we started doing things with greg in the backfield and every time you handed him the ball he made about 10 yards so it was like well how fast can he learn the protections and how quick can he learn everything at running back we put him on the fast track and by georgia tech id say he knew 60 percent of the offense as a running back and the next week against duke he probably knew 65 percent hopefully now hes at a point where he knows everything were doing
830972 i think bryon is one of those players that you know sometimes if you dont see the light at the end of the tunnel you never get your best effort its like no matter how hard i play there is this guy that is a two year starter in front of me i think what he sees now is an opportunity to finish on a real positive note hes worked harder according to our strength and conditioning program than hes ever worked in his entire career which gives you a chance to be a competitive player obviously selfishly as a coach the more juniors and seniors that you have that you are starting the better you feel about any part of your football team we would love for him to be that but hes got to be the best guy hes going to get pushed by a lot of guys to play id still love the opportunity to play as many as seven eight nine guys in every game but hes got to earn it right now hes paid the price to be given that opportunity
830973 you need 40 or 50 guys and i think a great lesson that we learned was last year at wake forest we were terrible on special teams so many of our kids that shouldve been playing on special teams were starting quan sturdivant bruce carter a lot of the young freshman guys were starting positionally on offense and defense and i think it dawned on a lot of our players that hey you know what we better make sure that these freshmen and red shirt freshmen know how to play to be able to go in and play on special teams because we got embarrassed that day we were atrocious we turned the ball over and played poorly on special teams and thats about as fast as a way to lose games as we could possible have but i love our kids attitude
830974 i dont know it could happen this year it could happen at anytime in the very near future were definitely moving the football program in the right direction we need more depth talent and speed but were moving in the right direction
830975 they had a deal on tv the other day called workout warriors in college football and if there is anybody in college football as a wide receiver that has a better work ethic and is strong and physically more gifted then he i dont know who it might be hes fast he set a school record in the bench press and hes a great athlete one of the real regrets that we had at the end of the season was not finding more ways for him to touch the football between hakeem and brooks and brandon we feel like we have three really talented wide receivers and theyve all got to try to be involved in every game plan
830976 i dont know that he is average but i know that our offensive coordinator john shoop really tries to find ways to get everybody involved and one of the guys that we want to continue to grow his role is zack pinalto as a true freshman last year when you get defenses to start to worry about the outside three wide receivers you really need to be able to run the ball and have a really talented tight end the more weapons the quarterback has the better off that you are so we want to try to get all three of those guys involved as much as we can
830977 special teams will be a big part of it and self inflicted wounds of not turning the ball over offensively weve got to run the ball better not turn the ball over as much weve got to do a great job on special teams we really didnt dominate the field position aspect on special teams like a good football team needs to
830978 i try not to to be honest with you i just try to have kids that our respectful of their teammates of the school and the opportunity to play you just try to get kids to buy in into the idea of how important it is to do the right thing kids are going to make mistakes and kids sometimes need second chances i just believe that as youre building the culture and environment of your program there are certain things that sometimes unfortunately theres no compromise sometimes there are things that youve got to try and get those kids to mature and grow up thats one of things that we need in our program last year we only had four seniors that played and you need to get more senior leaders you need to get guys that can be mentors to the younger guys to help them understand and appreciate how important it is to do the right things on the field and off the field
830979 good yeah i feel good i do some period follow ups with the doctors at unc and everything has been negative and ive passed every test im closing in sometime in the very near future hopefully like on the last of those if i can make it here another four or five months than i wont have to ever go back again so so far its all been clear sailing ive been god blessed and very fortunate
830980 sometimes when i see the ball and i am running full speed i have to tell myself no
830981 you keep finding yourself having to move out of the way its a weird feeling
830982 when i looked at kenny initially he was in the middle of the field
830983 the next thing i know i am picking myself up off the ground and i got blood coming off my elbow and stuff like that
830984 when i ran through the line i got up to the secondary and sammy knight hit me and got me a little off balance and kenny finished me off
830985 he is still learning the rigors of camp when to lay off and when not to lay off but at the same time you look forward to a safety who takes chances and will come up and smack the running back
830986 i want to go out there this preseason and keep doing what i have been doing in practice get in position to take someones head off i dont want to try to hurt him intentionally but i am just doing my job if the reputations comes cool ill take it
830987 alot of rumblings around greentree today i will admit this porter commit surprised me this morning after being investigated might be alot more to the story hmmmmmmm myself and gr8 are working on it fbc i think ill be by there tomorrow we might have to talk
830988 wonder if the gators told him to commit only to have him switch at the last second
830989 try to get kids to buy in into the idea of how important it is to do the right thing
830990 when we talked about youve got to watch more film you cant just come over and watch film for 30 minutes before practice and assume that youre ready to play on saturday lifting running mentoring to younger kids our older players taking a leadership role of realizing that 11 guys cant win a game you need 40 or 50 guys and i think a great lesson that we learned was last year at wake forest we were terrible on special teams so many of our kids that shouldve been playing on special teams were starting
830991 jimmy johnson without question jimmys boldness i thought was something that was extraordinarily understated i remember back at oklahoma state we wanted to try and be a 3 4 team and we had dexter manley and a few guys we played horribly in like one or two games of the season we started off lost to west texas state and wichita state and he came in sunday and said okay were scrapping this defense and going to a 4 3 by this saturday we were changing total defensive schemes in four days and it was kind of the turnaround in the program that eventually we got a lot better and started recruiting great athletes
830992 what happened to my boy loco he cash in his blade money and move off to hawaii
830993 this sucks i only got 75 catches this season they never throw it my way
830994 cav i totally agree with solar the only games that you can say randy out coached anyone was against tamu clearly dominated and fsu fake fg was the bomb he was clearly out coached against unc uva gt look we are all canes fans well except for scum and randy shannon fans but to not admit that he made mistakes and got out coached in several games last year is just foolish bordering on ignorant he will get better this year and next and the year after that and the talent he is collecting will make him look better as time goes by
830995 what happened to my boy loco he cash in his blade money and move off to hawaii
830996 forget the fact nobody on this team other than safety lovon ponder has thrown a pass at the collegiate level
830997 stealing beer from a cooler at the club 216 nightclub
830998 86 ill let you know when well start the q amp as later this week im trying to figure out how busy ill be next tuesday
830999 patrick hill has been a blessing to us we love what he brings he brings exactly what we thought he would hes one of those kids we really recruited when i recruited him i told this kid i wanted him to tell me that he wanted to run the football because if he told me he wanted to run the football i was going to leave him in california but he never told me once he wanted to run the football i asked him once what would be your idea of a great game he said if i can just go and knock a couple guys out if i can just knock about five guys out i said you got a scholarship offer from the university of miami son and hes done a great job for us we didnt need a guy griping and frustrated because hes not running the football no we needed a guy who would bring some toughness to our offense and we can go inside and bang around the tackles and get some movement
831000 yes absolutely it is the head coachs fault if the players are not focused you have to get their attention u have to get them to focus if they arent focused they should never see the field i dont care if u have to bench half the team and direct snap every play to the rb and run every down or play all freshmen or play 5 lbs or 6 safeties because your dl is alseep or injured or go for it on every fourth down or quick kick the ball away because your punter cant kick it over 20 yards what u might lose the game 48 0 oh they did that anyway because they werent focused how much worse could it get take all of your lumps in year one when nobody expects you to do anything anyway u want to play on my team u focus or u sit period end of story its not an option to focus i thought club coker was closed give me a break
831001 you cant trade em or fire them like the nfl
831002 yes absolutely it is the head coachs fault if the players are not focused you have to get their attention u have to get them to focus if they arent focused they should never see the field i dont care if u have to bench half the team and direct snap every play to the rb and run every down or play all freshmen or play 5 lbs or 6 safeties because your dl is alseep or injured or go for it on every fourth down or quick kick the ball away because your punter cant kick it over 20 yards what u might lose the game 48 0 oh they did that anyway because they werent focused how much worse could it get take all of your lumps in year one when nobody expects you to do anything anyway u want to play on my team u focus or u sit period end of story its not an option to focus i thought club coker was closed give me a break
831003 you cant trade em or fire them like the nfl
831004 your the one being one sided cav you make seem like shannon had a great first year coaching i mean he was ok but he made lots of mistakes which is expected of a first year coach we dont know if he is going to be great based on last year
831005 86 people forget randy coached all these guys i love how people make it seem like he was not part of the program before he got hired everything in the world was cokers fault even though he gave randy full control of the defense for all the years
831006 you make it seem like shannon had a great first year of coaching
831007 that master motivator shannon he had them all focused and ready to go
831008 i look at a guy whos 63 210 and think hes ready to dominate
831009 cav there u go again if you cant make your point without all the hostility and profanity maybe you dont really have a point in the first place
831010 there was once this guy named alonso highsmith that is the best fullback we have ever had
831011 put down the knives and step back from the blog
831012 its a dog eat dog world out there and im wearing milk bone underwear
831013 see we may suck now see minnesotas 2007 nightmarish trainwreck of a season but well be good later therefore we will place total faith in this guy that led us to our most disgustingly pitiful season in years because obviously he will make us an unstoppable juggernaut in the near future duh screw that last guy that had us getting to bowl games every year and not losing to fcs teams
831014 weve lost a lot of respect people dont respect us so its time to outwork people so they will respect us
831015 the internet age has only hastened every fans need to feel entitled to dictate a programs terms to its administration
831016 well i was joking because cookware and stuff arent weapons or things cops tell you to put down normally
831017 the internet age has only hastened every fans need to feel entitled to dictate a programs terms to its administration
831018 that is ridicoulous you cant throw away a season when after oklahoma it was obvisious issues arising then after unc i mean common on i dont believe that shannon wasnt involved with the defense last year if he wasnt that is a huge mistake on his part i mean that his area of expertise do you think meyer is not involved in floridas offense or tuberville in auburns and so on
831019 hey man wow this room stinks it smells like it smells like bum thats it it just smells like bum dirty dirty bum perhaps those guys on that bunk have been bumming a bit too much someone light some incense
831020 university of minnesota defensive coordinator everett withers has left after one season to take the same position at north carolina according to a published report the star tribune of minneapolis reported monday that the minnesota defensive coordinator was expected to replace chuck pagano who left the tar heels after one season to take an assistants job with the baltimore ravens withers departure which was first reported by sns tom dienhart follows a season in which the golden gophers ranked last in the nation in defense in 2007 yielding 518 67 yards per game during a 1 11 season prior to joining minnesota withers was defensive backs coach of the tennessee titans from 2001 06 the charlotte n c native and appalachian state alum also was defensive backs coach at texas 1998 2000 and defensive coordinator at louisville 1995 97 withers 44 broke into the nfl in 1994 as a defensive quality control assistant with the new orleans saints he also has served on the staffs at southern miss tulane and austin peay
831021 good old 6 stan shakespeare was a good wideout across from eddie brown on the first championship team more so he was a nice guy his drowing death a few years ago was very sad he had worked in jupiter at a home depot and we would chat a lot i had recognized his name on the computer when looking up info about a refrigerator and he was ear to ear smiles when i asked if he was that stanley shakespeare from the 83 canes my wife was a little miffed after an hour of chatting about the canes that afternoon we talked occasionally over those few years and i remember his opinion after the loss to ohio state was that the canes shouldnt have been in that position to lose anyway not putting away a clearly less talented team throughout the game as they should have anyway nice to have him remembered thanks
831022 some of the players we had to get rid of were kind of cancerous to the team
831023 they really brought us down and didnt care about football theyre gone now which is really good for us we can get back to focusing on football
831024 if you read into what the players say they know
831025 i can keep preaching on what we need to get done at miami and i said it all last year during the season ive put it on myself to get it done ive put it on myself to make sure we bring in the right kids who love football who have passion for it who have great character and want to win for the right reasons the players this year have taken control of some things now
831026 youve got to be relaxed to play this game you cant be all stiff all tight just be relaxed and play football and we havent always done that
831027 before everybody cared about football and everybody cared about winning
831028 but totally devoting themselves to what were trying to get done and buying into the system and our coaches and each other thats ultimately what it takes to be successful at this level and were definitely on our way
831029 they are one of only four teams in the last 30 years to have won three straight versus miami fsu vt and notre dame the others
831030 the right kids who love football who have passion for it
831031 he is so far beyond so much better than everybody else with speed knowledge being athletic he could take three years off and still be better than anybody else
831032 he wants to know whats going on thats understandable if hes injured or healthy hed want to be with us here right now
831033 does butch know he doesnt have miami talent at unc
831034 how these guys develop will have something to say about the kind of success we have and how much our team improves this year
831035 everybodys been going to class everybodys been handling their business
831036 this group has really come in with the mind set that hey were going to do everything we can possibly do to play and to compete i feel like competition raises the level of everybody on your football team
831037 thats what theyve come in and done and its been good for us
831038 he is definitely making plays on those guys and that makes me think he can do the same thing on saturday for us
831039 its negative energy and its not gonna help you improve
831040 ive just never seen a group that wants it as bad as they do with them coming in and being like that its going to raise everybodys play i just feel good about the group they brought in
831041 the seven other freshmen who did not report are safeties c j odom fort myers and c j holton crawfordsville
831042 look forward to a long and successful career for him both academically and on the football field
831043 he became involved in a situation at his school during his senior year that certainly has caused us concern at the same time we have personal knowledge of josh through our recruiting contact with him and from personal references from his school and individuals of authority in his life
831044 we have already stressed to him that his citizenship is of the utmost importance he understands that anything less than exemplary behavior will not be tolerated
831045 please mommy dont make me go to the u because they have competition
831046 i believe this is what people mean when they say
831047 london was amazed not by the hit but by phillips speed in catching up to him london had beaten cornerback kevin dockery on a go pattern and was getting ready to make an uncontested catch
831048 when i looked at kenny initially he was in the middle of the field
831049 the next thing i know i am picking myself up off the ground and i got blood coming off my elbow and stuff like that
831050 hurricane fans havent forgotten the recruitment of pompano beach ely db patrick johnson and now another ely db has um hot on his trail and hes getting some advice from johnson what is the advice and what is this player saying about miami and more read on
831051 i cant wait to play those guys i hope the first play lasts five minutes because im going to hit everybody
831052 we fell in the poll one week when we didnt play
831053 we all said were going to show the entire nation show all the doubters that were back

831055 those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it
831056 the scars from a 5 7 season were still visible friday afternoon one day before the 2008 miami hurricanes begin official practices the wounded players and head coach included put on a confident face for the media but no longer can this group pull off the big and bad act convincingly not after the past two seasons not when the three starting quarterback candidates have never taken an ncaa snap which normally signals impending mediocrity at best that top ranked recruiting class that is supposed to expedite the hurricanes climb back to greatness it could have as many as eight players ineligible to play this season further tempering any excitement even if the canes did manage to put on a believable performance friday there werent many to watch the show not a single national media presence in the crowd its where the hurricanes stand as they begin the 2008 campaign on the edge of irrelevance its not a familiar or comfortable place as they look around these canes are desperate to get out of it in order for us to walk out there and intimidate people like that you have to put in the work senior linebacker glenn cook said and i dont think some of our groups understood that we werent putting in the work but we were expecting the results as a result expectations are gone entirely now no respect in poll in case you werent sure about that check the first coaches poll released friday miami was nowhere to be found not even in the others receiving votes category granted preseason rankings are beyond meaningless but being entirely absent from the coaches poll speaks to the fading national perception of the canes consider which teams did receive respectful nods from the ncaas football coaches south florida is 21st florida state which suffered through a similarly miserable 7 6 season and didnt bring in as strong a recruiting class as miamis received almost enough votes for the top 25 connecticut which wasnt even good enough to be part of the big east conference until the canes bailed for the atlantic coast conference received votes notre dame a team that had to win its last two games just to finish 3 9 last season is considered a candidate to have a better season than miami ucf received votes making it four florida teams that coaches consider to be in better shape than the canes that would have been blasphemous talk just three years ago shannons ranking that 2005 um team finished the season getting pummeled by lsu in the peach bowl this years team free of a single preseason all acc selection would welcome the opportunity to get pummeled by any team in the peach bowl shannon coaching a group of larry cokers recruits wasnt exempt from judgment after missing out on a bowl game last year for whatever its worth a sporting news ranking of the 66 bcs coaches released this spring had shannon ranked quite low oklahoma states soon to be 41 year old coach mike gundy still a man was ranked well ahead of shannon dave wannstedt and butch davis too new west virginia coach bill stewart whose only previous head coaching experience was an 8 25 failure at virginia military institute that ended after he made a racially insensitive remark about one of his players was listed ahead of shannon you probably dont know where gene chizik paul wulff or art briles are employed but they were ranked higher than shannon as well actually name a coach and he was deemed a better head coach than miamis second year man yep shannon was ranked 66th dead last humiliating not really not when you consider the source if that stuff mattered wed all be fired or released from our scholarships cook said no repeat all of it though is a reminder of last seasons disappointment shannon has a strategy for getting over that the quickest way to get over something is just forget about it he said everybody always says you always have to fail to succeed when you fail get rid of it and dont let anyone else know that you failed how much of last season has he successfully blocked out everything he said i let it go whats that they say about those who ignore history cook working on his sixth year of eligibility is convinced the canes wont repeat it he sees past his coachs words he always tells us you cant dwell on it if you lose confidence over one year you shouldnt be playing you shouldnt be coaching cook said i think he knows where this is going hopefully for his sake the canes will be going in a different direction than the rest of the country is predicting

831210 it is another example of hateful sexist language being used on the campaign trail and now is our moment to make it clear not on our watch

831231 wow thats fantastic but you need an adult to help you out because you have to be a registered voter
831232 but before we get into logistics i dont often get calls from 16 year olds can you tell me how you know about ralph
831233 two years ago mr nader came to my high school
831234 i helped organize that there was a standing room only crowd what did you think of ralphs speech
831235 i was a freshman and i was in world history class and my class didnt go i guess they thought that ralph didnt fit with world history
831236 yeah but ive been interested in mr nader since then reading about him and i want to help him
831237 today was truly amazing no more than a few days ago i felt an overwhelming feeling of worthlessness i felt that there was nothing that i could do due to my age and transportation issue then we talked and i went out and did something i truly felt like i was a part of something that i was making history i could have volunteered for many other political campaigns but it was the nader gonzalez campaign that truly inspired me i can openly support every policy of the campaign and sleep at night this is a campaign that puts national interest before personal interest we the people not for sale gives me chills it is truly amazing to see an entire organization of everyday people working towards one beautiful common goal and putting power back into the hands of the people
831238 the oregonian july 16 2007 would break the news of james burmeister and of the kill teams targeting iraqi civilians
831239 i think my son is a hero there are many iraqis who were not killed because of what he did and many gis whose lives were saved because of it he made a tremendous service to his country by standing up and bearing witness to the bait and kill war crimes
831240 i feel like the case was used as an example to other soldiers not only will you get punished but your loved ones will be too
831241 im very disappointed in the way they feel they can treat veterans of war i think the reason my son went awol was for a good reason i dont think he deserved the punishment he got
831242 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd please see the page for what you can do
831243 i cant practice democracy at the parliament while the dictatorship is attacking and burning the headquarters of the turkmen front in kirkuk and burning and looting other turkmen establishments
831244 the bombing and reprisals provided a glimpse of the passions among kurds turkmens and arabs over the future boundaries of iraqs arab north and its kurdistan region
831245 where there are only families who earn their living raising sheep this is the first time that turkish planes have attacked during the day we have not received any information about casualties
831246 a reuters witness said large numbers of iraqi police and army personnel had deployed in baquba where they were searching homes the u s military was present in small numbers backed by helicopters the witness said
831247 i think this allowed armed groups to flee outside the province
831248 only three or four families remained six months ago there were 30 to 40 families this eerie scene has been played out repeatedly in other villages across the southeastern corner of diyala province one of the countrys most notorious areas
831249 this act is a clear evidence that the iraqi state seeks to liquidate trade unions in this important iraqi economic sector it is important to note that the south is the main source of oil in iraq
831250 we told hussain al shahristani the iraqi oil minister that this was not acceptable and informed him that we were aware of the measures being taken by the oil ministry
831251 the withdrawal of the order is a victory for international solidarity and iraqi trade unions
831252 to hold an international labor conference in iraq in february 2009 this is an important and urgent step toward strengthening and unifying the labor movement in iraq only through increased solidarity in iraq and with workers in the region and around the world can we hope to impact the fate not only of workers but of all iraqis learn more we call upon all unions and other labor organizations and individual union members and others around the world to support this conference morally and financially
831253 once the u s occupation of iraq began over a year ago iraqi workers lost no time in reorganizing their countrys labor movement labor activity spread from baghdad to the kurdish north with the center of the storm in the south in the oil and electrical installations around basra and the port of um qasr workers quickly discovered that the occupation authorities had little respect for labor rights however
831254 iraq is in the grip of a water crisis after this years seasonal rains failed wiping out crops in some parts of the country and causing an unusually high number of sandstorms because the land is so dry dams and reservoirs in neighbouring turkey and syria have made the problem worse the level of water in the tigris and the euphrates the rivers that flow from the two countries into iraq has fallen by more than 60 per cent over the past 20 years
831255 precisely because i have not served in uniform i am somebody who strongly believes i have to earn the trust of men and women in uniform
831256 having declared afghanistan a good war the complicit enablers are now anointing barack obama as he tours the bloodfests in afghanistan and iraq what they never say is that obama is a bomber in the new york times on 14 july in an article spun to appear as if he is ending the war in iraq obama demanded more war in afghanistan and in effect an invasion of pakistan he wants more combat troops more helicopters more bombs bush may be on his way out but the republicans have built an ideological machine that transcends the loss of electoral power because their collaborators are as the american writer mike whitney put it succinctly bait and switch democrats of whom obama is the prince
831257 obama is being consumed as the embodiment of colour blindness
831258 its the notion that we have moved beyond racism by not taking race into account thats what makes him conceivable as a presidential candidate hes become the model of diversity in this period a model of diversity as the difference that makes no difference the change that brings no change
831259 support for an open ended us military presence in iraq
831260 some of your advisors have said it could be tens of thousands of troops why cant you be more specific as to what you envision
831261 as ive said before i am not interested in a false choice between either perfect inflexibility in which the next 16 months or the next two years i ignore anything thats happening in iraq or alternatively that i just have an open ended indefinite occupation of iraq in which were not putting any pressure on the iraqis to stand up take this burden on what im gonna do is to set a vision of where we need to go a clear and specific timeframe within which were gonna pull our combat forces out
831262 obama is always talking about his past as a community organizer but again and again day after day hes back tracking surrendering flip flopping and appointing the worst corporatist advisors you can imagine
831263 they represent a minority viewpoint we represent a majority of the american people
831264 if you dont resist the situation gets worse the alternative is surrender the stands mccain and obama have taken again and again do not have the support of the majority of the american people
831265 why arent these issues talked about by the major parties
831266 ralph nader is a step closer to getting his name on missouris presidential ballot robert dalaviras state coordinator for the nader campaign delivered two boxes of petitions to the secretary of states office in jefferson city this morning
831267 a comprehensive negotiated military and corporate withdrawal date from iraq
831268 a single payer canadian style private delivery free choice public health insurance system for all
831269 a living wage and repeal of the anti union taft hartley act
831270 a no nuke solar based energy policy supported by renewable sustainable energy efficient sources
831271 an end to corporate welfare and corporate crime that has resulted in millions losing pensions savings and jobs and squandered tax dollars
831272 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations
831273 this is the worst state in the country in terms of denying voters their own choice of candidates
831274 i cant vote for anybody who doesnt call for an immediate end to the war in iraq
831275 the war under post nuremburg laws is a criminal war of aggression its illegal we have no right as a nation to debate the terms of the occupation we have no right to be there
831276 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
831277 supposedly he had left boot camp in december for christmas break i guess he decided he didnt want to be in the army anymore so he fled to brampton
831278 i was really interested in aviation and having a career in aviation one day the air force recruiter came to school and i was talking to her about joining the military as an air force maintenance technician and eventually working to become a pilot
831279 more of a liberal lean towards politics so i started seeing it through those eyes and thats when i started becoming a little discontent with the war and the government but i was still ready to go
831280 i just questioned a lot of things i was being taught
831281 it just seemed like a really hateful angry situation i didnt want to be in
831282 wow yeah this is what i am this is what im going to apply for so i can get out of the military
831283 the united states has now appropriated more than 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for iraqs reconstruction
831284 the u s government paid a california contractor 142 million to build prisons fire stations and police facilities in iraq that is has nver built or finished
831285 sigir reviewed the largest task order task order 51 which called for parsons to design and construct 21 fire stations in anbar and baghdad because of multiple delays and cost increases the u s government reduced the number of stations to be constructed to 100 later another fire station was eliminated before construction began because of land ownership issues and a second was terminated for the convenience of the government after it was bombed twice during construction leaving nine in 2006 parsons completed the nine fire stations and transferred them to the goi the award fee paid to parsons for wok on this tark order was 296 294 23 of the total available award fee
831286 a leader in many diverse markets such as infrastructure transportation water telecommunications aviation commerical environmental industrial manufacturing education healthcare life scienes and homeland security
831287 suggested the government needed to rethink its heavy dependence on the private sector for reconstruction security and support in a combat environment the comments are unusual for the leader of a firm that makes much of its money doing work for the government then again few have been battered as badly as parsons an employee owned california base compnay with a six decade track record since the spring when news of the stumbling health clinic program first broke the companys preformance has been derided in the press and upt under the microscope at congressional hearings at a hearing in september rep henry a waxman d calif spoke of a 75 million police academy that parsons was responsible for but that wend badly awry this is the lens through which iraqis will now see america incompetence profiteering arrogance and human waste oozing out of ceilings as a result
831288 it is looked at as profiteering and we shouldnt have that go on a time when weve got brave american men and women who are facing the possibility of giving their lives to help the u s effort
831289 we are somehow taking advantage of either the iraqi people or our government
831290 i dont think anybody ought to get paid and be able to keep the money if they didnt do what they were supposed to do then they found that the iraqi subcontractors didnt do the work so why should the united states taxpayers pay for that we should get our money back
831291 there is nothing wrong with our firm having made a profit on that work that we did over there in iraq it was legitimately earned it was honestly earned and none of our employees nor our firm should feel the least bit bad about that
831292 getting a definitive answer on the number of clinics completed by parsons is not easy of the original 151 promised the construction company says it handed over 20 fully equipped completed health care centers the army corps of engineers disputes that number saying it received only six completed clinics some of those needed additional work the corps says
831293 iraqs oil revenues will crest 70 billion by the end of the year
831294 about 142 million was spent on various parsons projects that were ultimately canceled or not completed including kahn bani saad
831295 this meant the government was capable of fundign reconstruction projects itself the report also criticised the iraqi authorities for failing to improve sewage and drainage facilities roger hardy the bbcs middle east analyst said the report was the latest in a string of criticisms by the watchdog of the way in which american taxpayers money is being spent in iraq
831296 democratic leaders in congress are pushing the administration to pressure the iraqi government to fund its own infrastructure projects through rising oil revenue
831297 military officers both iraqi and americans said the insurgents had probably fled the are after news media reports that the sweep was to begin soon though officials had been saying publicly that it would be likely to begin in early august
831298 iraqi soldiers and national police encountered no resistance as they knock in baqubah and the town of khan bani saad about 15 miles south but this is well trod ground for the iraqi forces and their u s counterparts who have conducted repeated operations in the area since last year
831299 called on iraqs leaders not to sign a security deal with the united states offering to throw his support behind the government if the talks were scrapped
831300 democrat led congress are as unconcerned about political justice as is any neo con in rupert murdochs rolodex
831301 screening by breast self examination or physical examination cannot be recommended
831302 be encouraged to seek medical advice if they detect any change in their breasts that may be breast cancer
831303 bse while not proven to save lives is the one detection method that women have control over with their own two hands
831304 even back in the old days there was a screening process for people who work in those laboratories
831305 there are time honored procedures to examine security clearances on a regular basis to verify information provided by the security clearance holder and traditional steps to ensure that only the appropriate level of security access is granted largely based on the nature of the persons government job
831306 i dont know whether this is just another false track and a real diversion from where they need to be
831307 i dont think its helpful to respond to piecemeal judgments by individuals who are not informed about the case or the evidence
831308 we will make public what we can at the appropriate time and well try to do it all at once with considerations for the victims and their families first
831309 obviously it coincided with the events everyone is talking about
831310 bush did not receive permission from the united nations to invade iraq in september 2004 then u n secretary general kofi annan stated that the war was not in conformity with the u n charter from our point of view and from the charter point of view it was illegal a number of military personnel most notably 1st lt ehren watada have refused to serve in the war because they consider it illegal and have been court marshaled as a result
831311 the contract expired in 2006 its time for the military to release him instead they keep him in the military and he has to report for duty on the base every day
831312 canadians are very distressed by this this is going against the tradition we have in our country
831313 they have a higher obligation to international law than their duty to just follow orders we now know soldiers are systematically ordered to violate international humanitarian law in iraq from torture to intentionally targeting civilians and there are more revelations of war crimes emerging every day the u s soldiers seeking refuge in canada signed up to defend their country not to commit war crimes
831314 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
831315 some iraqis think that the offensives that prime minister nouri al maliki launched in the southern cities of basra and amara and the baghdad slum of sadr city were to weaken his political rivals the sadrists who controlled those areas the possibility of a months long delay in the elections could fundamentally alter the priorities of local and national politicians
831316 the contentious issue was among several points that have delayed a vote on the law that would pave the way for the first local elections since january 2005 when most sunni arabs and many shiite followers of cleric muqtada sadr boycotted the vote u s officials believe the participation of such groups could go a long way toward righting the balance of power in provincial politics in which a small number of parties mainly kurdish and shiite muslim have dominated
831317 the disagreement centered on the multiethnic city of kirkuk one of several areas in iraq where there are competing claims over which province a city or district belongs in the question for kirkuk is whether it should be absorbed into the kurdistan region a particularly charged question because the city sits on some of the largest unexploited oil reserves in the country both arabs and kurds lay claim to the area at bottom the disagreement is also about the ethnic identity of iraq and about arab frustration with the kurds although the kurds are a minority they have proved adept at turning the political process to their advantage often to the chagrin of larger ethnic and religious groups
831318 the president who does not agree with such a law which was voted on by 127 deputies who do not represent half of parliament is confident that the presidency council will not pass it
831319 wednesdays move which comes after protests by kurdish and some shia mps is likely to delay the elections which have been encouraged by us officials as a key step toward repairing iraqs sectarian rifts
831320 correspondents say this would be a blow to the outgoing us administration of president george w bush which sees the elections as a key step to the national reconciliation between iraqs dividied communities
831321 is to take a hard look at the current state of the army medical action plan this will be the third hearing this subcomitt has held on the army medical action plan the armys response to the revelations at walter reed army medical center last year since it was issued in june 2007 when the army medical action plan execution order was issued last summer the military personnel subcomittee believed that the army had finally demonstrated a full understanding and acceptance of the organizational and systemic short comings that had led to the scandalous conditions at walter reed we felt that the army medical action plan was a comprehensive and ambitious blue print to tackle these issues head on after years of frustration many on the subcomittee believed that the army was finally ready to take the necessary steps to solve these problems however from our very first briefing on the army medical action plan we had two significant concerns the first was that the army would be unable to initially dedicate and then maintain over the long haul the level of resources required by the army medical action plan specifically we were worried that the army would be unable to assign adequate numbers of personnel to the warrior transition units why because the core of the warrior transition units were to be the same soldiers that make up the backbone of our brigade combat teams mid grade non commissioned officers and these soldiers were already in short supply the second concern was that army commanders would overwhelm the warrior tranistion units by sending them all of their soldiers with medical issues rather than just those with complex injuries or conditions that required comprehensive case management in truth we do not feel that this was necessarily a bad thing especially if it helped units deploy at full strength while injured or ill soldiers had the opportunity to fully recover of course this would only work if warrior transition units were properly resourced to take care of these soldiers from june 2007 through february 2008 the members and staff of this subcommittee made numerous visits to warrior transition units throughout the army the overall trend we observed was positive the army medical action plan was clearly providing better support for recovering soldiers than the previous medical holdover system one wounded warrior commented thank god for the warrior transition unit things are so much better than they were before that was good to hear but despite the positive trends we were frustrated at the slow progress of implementing the amap we felt that things should have and could have been moving faster we also felt that there was a discconnect between how quickly the army leadership believed things were happening and what the facts on the ground seemed to indicate again despite the challenges we felt things were moving in an overall positive direction however our concerns about warrior transition unit staffing levels and the potential of line units quote dumping soldier on the warrior transition unit continued we asked general eric schoomaker about this repeatedly during our hearing in february to get an update on the amap in response to a question asked by mr john mchugh the army surgeon general declared for all intents and purposes we are entirely staffed at the point we need to be staffed as the facts at fort hood demonstrate that is clearly not the case now gentlemen the army medical action plan was designed by the army it is your plan the army senior leadership has publicly trumpeted your commitment to wounded soldiers at every opportunity and we believe that that is true but the secretary of defense agrees as dr robert gates has made clear apart from the war itself this department and i have no higher priority
831322 there continues to be serious shortfalls shortfalls that our staff did identify and i know the army continues to try to deal with serious questions that of resources a mechanism that anticipates the population growth that we have seen an explosion
831323 the generals were nervous lt gen robert wilson moved his index finger across the page as he read his statement with a halting delivery maj gen david rubenstein holding a discolored washcloth under the witness table to dry his perspiration accidentally dropped the cloth and felt for it with his shoe the anxiety even for men with two or three stars on each shoulder was to be expected they had come before a house armed services subcommittee to explain why 16 months and at least eight fact finding investigations after the walter reed scandal the army still hadnt fixed the health care system for soldiers wounded in iraq and afghanistan
831324 it is clear to us that this committee foresaw that better than we did
831325 but our heart was in the right place and remains in the right place
831326 in many ways this challenge isnt being met and i find the current circumstances unacceptable
831327 general rubenstein i dont mean to engage in a debate per se
831328 if we do eventually engage in a timetable for the redeployment of our soldiers so again youll be bringing back larger soldiers at once and particularly where the issue is ptsd where you might not have to deal with it really until the soldiers do come home can you envision what you would do in a situation where you simply become overwhelmed by the demand
831329 and where we may not be able to meet the needs if the numbers are overwhelming we fall to our civilian network providers
831330 how you see that changing at all that people are able to get the appointments they need
831331 finding no argument the lawmakers brought the hearing to a prompt close but not before another round of mutal flattery
831332 i dont want him to talk black i want him to talk justice
831333 whats the point of this country being on the verge of electing an african american president after all these years and then have it mean nothing
831334 obama is always talking about his past as a community organizer but again and again day after day hes back tracking surrendering flip flopping and appointing the worst corporatist advisors you can imagine
831335 we do have certain policy guidelines for political campaigns and elections and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in those situations but the pentagon certainly did not tell the senator that he could not visit landstuhl
831336 generally speaking the military tries very hard not to get involved in political campaigns
831337 conducting a campaign speech for example on a military installation is not something that would be appropriate to do
831338 when we arrived al assad this was april or the beginning of may 2003
831339 and this is the very beginning of the occupation and this is when we were being told that we had to keep people on sleep deprivation to psychological torture the orders came from way up top actually the people who were in charge of running these camps were ghost agents you know working for the us government and when the abu ghraib scandal came out they tried to tell the american public that you know this was an isolated event that had only began in november or december of 2003 and that it was the result of a few people you know who one day woke up and you know they were evil when in reality you know from from my experience i can tell you that this was actually something that was coming from the very top and that happened from the very beginning and that it was not isolated to abu ghraib but that was happening elsewhere in iraq from the very beginning of the occupation
831340 well in the military we have what is called spooks and these are people who are highly trained in counterinsurgency theyre highly trained in linguistics and interrogation and weapons systems and things like that and they dont wear name tags they dont wear unit id badges or anything like that they use pseudonyms and you know they dont respond to anybody in uniform they they basically take their orders from from the very top and theyre theyre untraceable and and obviously you know they can conduct themselves with absolute impunity these were people who were giving the commands when we were there not our commanders not the people who belonged to any unit you know but basically people with top secret clearance and you know who would never be held accountable for any of the things that happened
831341 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
831342 vas response to the needs of returning guard and reserve members
831343 im speaking personally not on behalf of the reserve the guard or the department of defense
831344 failed to send benefit packages to nearly 37 000 national guard and reserve members
831345 while the va has targeted outreach programs in place to help service members we still miss far too many veterans who need help and arent aware of the services and benefits they have earned
831346 maam its like this one person talks in the military and everyone else listens when you get home everyone talks everyone listens and nobody hears
831347 maam its too chaotic here please send me back where i know how to survive i know how to function i know how to do that
831348 i need help i need medication i need to talk to someone
831349 maam for the last three years ive been treated for ptsd by doctors nurses and others that have no clue over what is being a soldier and have this feeling inside
831350 i cant thank you enough for coming today in the last two hours you have done what nobody could have done you make me feel normal again that is a feeling that i thought i would never feel again since i was discharged from the army thank you and god bless
831351 for all intents and pruposes we are entirely staffed at the point we need to be staffed
831352 the armys unwavering commitment and a key element of our warrior ethos is that we never leave a soldier behind on the battlefield or lost in a bureaucracy
831353 an additional 1 500 a month of extnded duty retroactive to october 2001
831354 instead of being a civilian again and starting my life i was doing the polar opposite putting on a unifoorm and returning to iraq i had come back with pretty severe ptsd and depression and was having panic attacks
831355 armed with a 74 page grand jury presentation two weeks ago alleged that democratic house employees worked to challenge the 51 273 signatures nader and running mate peter camejo had gathered for access to the 2004 presidential ballot a dozen former and current house democratic lawmakers and employees face theft conspiracy and conflict of interest charges partly for their alleged role in derailing naders campaign
831356 nader wants relief from an 81 102 penalty for legal costs following court battles over his presidential nomination petition in 2004 he said he will file a challenge with the state supreme court nader said those damages should be dropped in light of criminal charges brought this month
831357 this was one of the most fraudulent and deceitful exercises ever perpetrated on pennsylvania voters
831358 according to the grand jury millions of dollars in taxpayer funds resources and state employees were illegally used for political campaign purposes including to remove the nader camejo ticket from the ballot
831359 i dont know of any acts of torture that have been committed by individuals in developing information
831360 so i would not certainly make an assumption i would attribute the absence of an attack since 9 11 at least in part because there have been specific attacks that have been disrupted to the excellent work and the dedication and commitment of people whose lives are dedicated to defending the country interrogators have used enhanced interrogation techniques but they havent used torture
831361 an individual must have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering
831362 the absence of specific intent negates the charge of torture we have further found that if a defendant acts with the good faith belief that his actions will not cause such suffering he has not acted with specific intent
831363 imagine that in an ordinary criminal prosecution a bank robber tortures a bank manager to get the combination to a vault he argues that the torture was not to inflict pain but to get the combination every torturer has a reason other than to cause pain if youre going to let people off the hook for an intention other than to cause pain youre not going to be able to prosecute anyone for torture
831364 as of 2006 there had been more than 330 cases in which u s military and civilian personnel have incredibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees this figure is based almost entirely on the u s governments own documentation these cases involved more than 600 u s personnel and more than 460 detainees held at u s facilities throughout afghanistan iraq and guantanamo bay they included some l00 plus detainees who died in u s custody including 34 whose deaths the defense department reports as homicides at least eight of these detainees were by any definition of the term tortured to death
831365 he said he was disturbed by a military tactic of planting equipment to lure iraqis that american snipers could then kill burmeister said he complained to superior officers that the snipers couldnt know for sure whether the people they shot were actually insurgents or presented any threat to u s forces
831366 burmeister said he complained to superior officers that the snipers couldnt know for sure whether the people they shot were actually insurgents or presented any threat to u s forces eventually the soldier from cheshire near eugene was injured by a roadside bomb and sent to germany to recuperate while there he left his unit and went to canada where he campaigned against the use of the small kill teams
831367 because i feel its the right thing to do even if i face prison or a dishonorable discharge from the army i cant go back to the killing
831368 on july 15 robin long became the first iraq war resister to be deported from canada back to the united states in 2005 long went to canada because he would not fight in an illegal war of aggression like thousands of young recruits long discovered that the iraq war was based on lies only after he had joined the military the court denied long sanctuary based on a so called lack of evidence that he would face harsh treatment if he were sent back to the united states the court was fully aware that long would be unjustly tried as a deserter could face prison time and be deployed to iraq against his will as an example to others on july 16 james burmeister a resister who turned himself over to the u s government was sentenced to 9 months in jail and dishonorably discharged protests in the u s and canada have demanded sanctuary for iraq war resisters two thirds of canadians believe that war resisters should be allowed to stay in canada
831369 we have a government in canada hell bent on pleasing the american administration if we believe its an illegal war why should we not give some form of sancturary to people who are refusing to fight that war
831370 stockwell day diane finley and stephen harper should respect the will of parliament and the canadian people and stop this deportation immediately the house of commons has passed a motion supporting a special programme that would allow conscientious objectors who refuse to serve in the war in iraq to remain in canada the government must respect this action by the house and stop deportation action against robin long and other iraq war resisters the canadian government and the canadian people do not support george bushs illegal war in iraq we must have the courage of those convictions and back them up by ensuring that americans who take a stand against that war receive a welcome in canada robin long must be allowed to stay
831371 canada denies asylum to us soldier who refused to serve in iraq
831372 and as the statement says we have reached a point in iraq where we can have these discussions about continuing to transition more control of the security situation to the iraqi forces but these are aspirational goals not arbitrary time lines based on political expediency so we want to get to a point where we have sustainable security in the country and our forces are able to come home and transition into a role there of more overwatch and training
831373 the bbcs adam brookes in washington says the announcement is designed to encourage the idea that us troops are coming home without committing to any dates
831374 white house spokesman gordon johndroe said the new statement doesnt reflect a shift in the u s position
831375 i think the well the white house issued a statement about this
831376 what am i going to add to the statement that has been issued
831377 i think in the final analysis that sweet talk is going to give into straight talk
831378 during just one six month period august 2006 through january 2007 at least 283 electrical fires destroyed or damaged american military facilities in iraq including the militarys largest dining hall in the country documents obtained by the new york times show two soldiers died in an electrical fire at their base near tikrit in 2006 the records note while another was injured while jumping from a burning guard tower in may 2007
831379 decades ago it was full of victories in the sixties and seventies
831380 full of victories you know regulated the lack of safety in motor vehicles flamable fabrics product safety commission all kinds of going after usary interest rates for the poor and many other pieces of legislation but now its purely defensive its trying to hold the gains of the sixties and seventies and thats become a losing fight because the democrats are not going after the republicans on this issue even in this campaign the republicans are terrible on consumer protection and the democrats are not fighting back
831381 fda is updating its warning to consumers nationwide concerning the outbreak of salmonella serotype saintpaul as of today fda officials believe that consumers may enjoy all types of fresh tomatoes available on the domestic market without concern of becoming infected with salmonella saintpaul the agency is removing the warning that has been in place since june 7 which states that consumers should avoid certain types of fresh tomatoes due to a potential connection to the salmonella saintpaul outbreak consumers may resume enjoying any type of fresh tomato including raw red plum raw red roma and raw red round tomatoes while we are changing our consumer guidance about tomatoes we reiterate our guidance to consumers that those in vulnerable populations infants the elderly and immune compromised people should avoid eating jalapeno and serrano peppers as the investigation continues
831382 a report recently released by the house committee on oversight and government reform called
831383 americans have continued to get sick at a rate of about 20 people per day even after
831384 it is absolutely outrageous that we are 90 days into the salmonella outbreak and the fda and cdc still cannot determine the source of contamination currently over 1200 cases of salmonella have been reported hundreds have been hospitalized while the outbreak has affected 41 states including washington dc and even canada the salmonella outbreak continues to spread with nearly 30 cases a day because we do not have a national comprehensive food traceability system that would quickly track our foods from the field to the fork now the fda is saying that tomatoes are safe but only because they have a short shelf life we still dont know the source of the contamination and that is inexcusable
831385 it seems highly unlikely that tomatoes harvested in april would still be consumed fresh by consumers in late june
831386 theyve stacked their payrolls with top washington power brokers of all political stripes including republican john mccains presidential campaign manager rick davis democrat barack obamas original vice presidential vetter jim johnson and scores of others now working for the two rivals for the white house
831387 in washington fannie and freddies sprawling lobbying machine hired family and friends of politicians in their efforts to quickly sideline any regulations that might slow their growth or invite greater oversight of their business practices indeed their rapid expansion was at least in part the result of such artful lobbying over the years

831394 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations
831395 the only way you can begin changing these restrictive laws which also of course deny voters their choices is get inside the electoral arena and battle it out
831396 also on friday the american military acknowledged that it unintentionally killed the son of an editor for an american financed newspaper in the northern city of the military said soldiers had been fired at from a taxi and shot back hitting arkan al naiemi 14 in the taxi
831397 said the image of his fathers burning vehicle haunts him hed waited in his fathers office that morning surprised that he wasnt there yet theyd left at nearly the same time that morning
831398 why did they kill him like this we demand that they send those soliders to an iraqi and american court
831399 it was only 10 000 my father was the main provider for our family we are a displace people we also have to replace our car we are in a very difficult time
831400 the findings call into question the way the military handled the aftermath of the shootings
831401 initially some soldiers thought that someone in the car was shooting and that iraqi police had found a weapon in the vehicle the miltiary said however no weapon was found and the passengers turned out to be a man and two women who worked at the airport bank
831402 early today 20 civilians were killed and 47 wounded by three female suicide bombers in eastern baghdad as shiite pilgrims marched to the imam kadhim shrine in west baghdad an interior ministry official said the attacks happened a day before a religious festival marking the death of the revered shiite figure who died in 799
831403 the pilgrims were walking through the karrada district of central baghdad towards kadhimiyah in the citys north where up to a million people will celebrate a shia festival when the bombers struck
831404 the bombers struck in quick succession in the karrada district of central baghdad as tens of thousands of shia pilgrims were making their way on foot towards kadhimiyah in the north of the iraqi capital site of todays shia festival a ceremony that has been marred by bloodshed in the past
831405 thousands of shiite muslims walk through this popular shopping district here in baghdad mournful religious sermons blare from speakers set up to greet them
831406 kurdish objections over a proposed power sharing formula on the provincial council in kirkuk have blocked the law from being passed kirkuk is in an oil rich area and many kurds consider it to be part of their historical land the area is home to kurds turkomen arabs and smaller groups
831407 the obama campaign scrapped the troop visit after the pentagon told them it would be viewed as a campaign event
831408 the pentagon said friday that it did no prevent an obama visit
831409 nobody denied senator obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at landstuhl obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and certainly visit in an official capacity
831410 senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event
831411 we do have certain policy guidelines for political campaigns and elections and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate in those situations but the pentagon certainly did not tell the senator that he could not visit landstuhl
831412 usually everyone lies for him but the pentagons not going to do that for him and now hes exposed as the man who decided to skip out on wounded service members after he was informed he couldnt turn it into a campaign stop if a tree falls in the forest when no one is around did it make a sound if barack emotes with no cameras around he thinks it wont make for a media sound byte so it was okay for him to blow off us soldiers how disgusting is he
831413 one military official who was working on the obama visit said because political candidates are prohibited from using military installations as campaign backdrops obamas representatives were told he could only bring two or three of his senate staff member no campaign officials or workers obama could nto bring any media only military photographers would be permitted to record obamas visit
831414 the most disappointing thing about this ad is that its beneath john mcain because hes playing political football with wounded soldiers
831415 i think john is treading on some very thin ground here when he
831416 i think a lot of people are wondering what happened to the civil campaign john mccain said he was going to run
831417 green spoke last weekend at the national now convention one that was subdued rather than boisterous in the wake of hillary clintons primary defeat by barack obama some now delegates wore hillary tee shirts there was minimal talk of obama and loud cheers whenever someone mentioned clinton
831418 we increased womens turnout by 200 percent in the democratic primaries gosh we came really close to nominating hillary i also was disheartened when i saw young women vilify senator clinton and vilify being a feminist
831419 obama draws an adoring crowd of 200 000 in berlin he pulls ahead in national polls meanwhile mccain who has run a near disastrous campaign inches up in key swing states go figure i say give obama the guitar he so richly deserves and make him a rock star give mccain a war to run somewhere and let voters redo the primaries so they can nominate two more mainstream candidates anyone who says the election is over and obama is the victor reminds me of the obama partisans drumming sen hillary clinton out of the race and turning off millions of potential democratic supporters in the process they do their candidate a much greater service if they duct tape their mouths
831420 while coverage of senator obamas berlin speech provided audiences here at home nothing less than a visual shock and awe it neglected to mention that the well hyped speech had an opening act a gratis concert by two wildly popular groups reggae artist patrice and rock band reamonn pictured below with barack obama while we appreciate the obama campaigns hospitality on behalf of furthering us germany relations offering free bratwurst pizza and even beer for three hours during the free rock concert we question whether or not the monies might have been better spent here on financially strapped us citizens similarly back on may 20 2008 in portland oregon senator obama took the stage following the critically acclaimed local band the decemerists who gave a rare free concert for 75 000 fans while news stories generated by both appearances focused on the enormity of the crowd size few mentioned the accompanying perks leaving some to question whether revelers are showing up for senator obama or for free food and entertainment without this additional information contends that americans are being misled about the presumptive democratic nominees true popularity
831421 more than 80 volunteer lawyers for guantanamo bay detainees today endorsed illinois senator barack obamas presidential bid
831422 if enacted this law would give license to this administration to pick people up off the streets of the united states and hold them indefinitely without charges and without legal recourse
831423 he is the only one on these issues who has consistently acted like a true american
831424 every one of these american citizens voluntarily joined the military not one was drafted these are not the draft dodgers of the vietnam war era the young men who had no choice in whether they wished to fight the vietcong
831425 draft dodgers you hear him ma but theres no draft today
831426 canada also extradited robin long a u s war resister who did not want to take part in possible war crimes this is a very different role than canada played during vietnam
831427 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
831428 iraq is able to take the security situation into its own hands we have achieved great success
831429 iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands we can say with some pride that were in the position and capable with our police and army and with our professional level to achieve that
831430 announced that iraq wants american combat troops to leave by the end of 2010
831431 we are pleased that the security situation in iraq has improved little by little and that is of course a pre condition for economic and political reconstruction to move forward iraq is a country rich in raw materials and germany has broad technological and industrial know how we are pleased that some german companies have already expressed interested in helping to rebuild iraq
831432 there is anger inside our people there is a volcano that wants to erupts but we are obedient to sayed muqtada
831433 in a shift toward political reconciliation and away from sectarianism iraqs largest sunni bloc ended a nearly yearlong boycott saturday and rejoined the cabinet retaking six ministry spots
831434 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
831435 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
831436 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
831437 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
831438 we call on the kudristan authorities to carry out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of hamas murder he wrote hard hitting articles about local politicians and security officials and had received threats from people telling him to stop his investigative reporting the authorities should therefore give priority to the theory that he was killed because of his work
831439 the first step to halt the assassinations against journalists is to capture those culprits
831440 if the government cant protect kurdish journalists in kirkuk we might adviste them to withdraw from this city
831441 leveen which is an independent kurdish magazine founded 6 years ago in sulaimani is known as a muckraking journal in kurdistan and iraq
831442 if either mccain or obama visits iraq it would be for campaign purposes and therefore at this point in time it wont have any effect on the situation in iraq
831443 it was people like you who created the situation in the first place by not fully seating or stripping clinton delegates from florida and michigan by not apologizing for the filthy race baiting campaign obama ran for not admitting obama didnt have the majority of the popular vote for not allowing clinton to take the contest all the way to the convention and for not condemning the smears by the attack dogs from the media and the progressive blogosphere for creating the rift
831444 how many ways do these hillary delegates voters and supporters need to hear it before they get it
831445 were angry because the nomination was stolen from the rightful winner were angry because the winner of the popular vote has been hindered not helped were angry that a man who truly isnt read to be president at this time has been propped up by the dnc and the democratic party as a whole and most especially were angry at the supposition that we only have two choices in the fall election obama or mccain neither of whom are acceptable
831446 believe most reporters will try to help obama with their coverage
831447 he didnt have reporters with him he didnt have a press pool he didnt have a press conference while he was on the ground in either afghanistan or iraq what youre seeing is not reporters brought in youre seeing selected pictures taken by the military questions by the military and what some would call fake interviews because theyre not interviews by a journalist so theres a real press issue here
831448 it seems practically every news person flew to be with the holly one to get interviews with the messiah maybe obama will replace lourdes and people with disabilities and illnesses can get blessed and have their problems disappear by touching the anointed one disgusting
831449 the central issue of this election is not barack obama versus john mccain the central issue is the future of the democratic party
831450 ralph nader is unique in the history of u s ballot access for trying to redress wrongs that were done to him and his voters other presidential candidates who were kept off ballots such as henry wallace in 1948 eugene mccarthy in 1976 and john anderson in 1980 were content to fight to keep themselves on various ballots but they never took legal action of their own after the election to redress harms they had suffered only nader has done that most notably in his lawsuit against the democratic national committee plus his complaint against the dnc filed with the federal election commission and also this particular ohio lawsuit
831451 shocked the conscience of those who believe in clean elections

831453 i tried to get conscientious objector status but my first sergeant told me he couldnt find the forms to apply and he didnt feel like looking for them i didnt know about conscientious objector status until a month before i got orders and that was when i first tried to do it shortly after that i got orders so i never really got a chance to apply for it
831454 owen sound sun times is a letter where past war resisters show solidarity with todays war resisters
831455 i was really messed up when i got back with feelings id never had before sometimes i just got angry just completely explosive
831456 i do it because i feel like theres a story that needs to be told
831457 i guess the hardest thing for people to understand is the reason you joing the military is not the reason you leave it not knowing the truth your basic role as a sodlier being invalidated finding out your job has no meaning no reason
831458 canada i am here will you take the time and the heart to understand what i am now fight for with words and not a gun
831459 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
831460 the president of the united states with gas at 4 a gallon because of his failed energy policies is now trying to say that is because i couldnt drill offshore that is not the cause and i am not going to let him get away with it
831461 her voice carries considerable weight because ms pelosi who is now house speaker can prevent a vote on expanded drilling from reaching the floor

831467 last week double suicide bombings killed 28 army recruits outside a military base in diyala
831468 it was in diyala that the phenomenon of women suicide bombers first appeared

831473 in fiscal 2006 women made up 17 percent of the army but 35 percent of discharges under the dont ask law one year later women were 15 percent of army members yet discharges of women increased to 45 percent of the total
831474 i should probably also point out that the ones kicked out arent necessarily lesbians or even bi sexual it can be a straight woman just as easily all it takes is some whispers which is why straight people should be against sexual closets as much as the lgbt community or the parts of the lgbt community that have pride in themselves
831475 imagine if those flashy recruiting commercials showed the real dangers a woman can face while serving in the military living her formative years in a hazardous work environment where racism and homophobia are tolerated for the sake of getting by and sexual harassment goes unreported so you dont ruin his career all this while women work twice as hard to prove themselves as soldiers more than just a bitch dyke whore
831476 its not enough to say oh whoop de do well get somebody else with a vagina we were not doing this because she was a woman we were doing this because she was fantastic on our issues
831477 theres just a feeling of we really put a lot of energy into this and we got a bad deal people are just saying maybe we just shouldnt vote this time
831478 this time we are taking the unusual step of endorsing the candidacy of cynthia mckinney because these are unique times and this is a unique candidate mckinney a courageous black woman and former u s congresswoman from georgia has become one of the most militant leaders and voices for the u s left progressive and black movements because of her militancy in the struggle against the war the struggle to impeach bush as well as her struggle to expose the governments role in the displacement of survivors of hurricane katrina she was branded too black and too radical to walk the halls of congress she was pushed out not once but twice by the leadership of the democratic party last year mckinney severed her ties to that party

831480 his parents have waged an unceasing struggle for the army to release him they called on their representative peter defazio to launch a congressional inquiry into jamess case but have so far heard nothing

831484 according to bob ages who is the chairman of the vancouver war resisters campaign robin long was in buckley which is south east of seattle as of friday and was moved once again to a location that is unknown to the group

831486 the first time a resister to the u s war effort in iraq has been removed from this country by canadian authorities
831487 this is a gift from canadian prime minister stephen harper to george bush and it is a gift to the headline writers who will trumpet that canada is no longer a safe haven for awol gis but it is an illusion because this is not the first of many deportations it may be the first and the last a minority government that ignores the will of its people and its parliament will not be allowed to rule much longer
831488 the questions we have to ask before the next federal election are what is the government doing to the canada that we treasure do we really want to live in a canada built in the image of the present government
831489 weve been trying to get a meeting with immigration minister diane finley and weve basically been told shell be busy until she dies
831490 one of those bar conversations ill probably remember for a lifetime
831491 hanging our heads in shame here was someone willing to stand up for what he believed in and leave his country rather than fight in a war he believed was illegal
831492 i just realized were not fighting terrorists there its just the occupation of the country and a lot things go unreported there things that are not supposed to be happening in a war zone things being covered up
831493 its a huge victory for numerous soldiers who are here and maybe others who are thinking of coming here
831494 children cry women scream at you we were tormenting these people we never found anything no potential terrorists no cache of weapons nothing after a while you start to ask yourself why are we continuing to do this youre not supposed to have sympathy youre not supposed to have a conscience youre supposed to be the perfect american soldier a killing machine who does as he is told but i realised that it was my concern and it was my business that i did have my conscience
831495 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd

831498 tried to step back sunday from comments in an interview
831499 the interpreter for the interview works for mr malikis office not the magazine
831500 theres starting to be a broad consensus that its time for us to withdraw some of our combat troops out of iraq deploy them here in afghanistan and i think we have to seize that opportunity nows the time for us to do it
831501 what ive said is that if we had actionable intelligence against high value al qaeda targets and the pakistani government was unwilling to go after those targets that we should my hope is that it doesnt come to that that in fact the pakistan government would recognize that if we had osama bin laden in our sights that we should fire or we should capture him
831502 well a mission accomplished would be that we had stabilized afghanistan that the afghan people are experiencing rising standards of living that we have made sure that we are disabling al qaeda and the taliban so that they can longer attack afghanistan they can no longer engage in attacks against targets of pakistan and they cant target the united states or its allies
831503 this proscrastination and foot dragging and lack of seriousness on the part of the british government has prolonged their psychological deterioration pushing one of them jason to commit suicide on 15 5 2008 he surprised our brethren who were taking care of him with his suicide

831509 what do you make of senator obamas trip to iraq and afghanistan to talking about a timetable for pullout nouri al maliki saying he shares his view though he was castigated it looks like by the president and senator mccain saying barack obama has the most extreme record in the senate suggesting perhaps hes a socialist
831510 you really think hes an extremist i mean hes clearly a liberal
831511 all i said was his voting record and that is more to the left than the announced socialist in the united states senate bernie sanders of vermont
831512 all i know is his voting record and thats what people usually judge their elected representatives by
831513 at the end of january based on their examination of his record
831514 in campaign news senator john mccain has accused barack obama of having the most extreme record in the senate and suggested obama might be a socialist mccain was asked about his views in an interview with the kansas city star

831523 we know we have to go over to africa its just about enjoying the moment
831524 by sending these patients to the transit lounge it meant that their beds could be freed up for new patients
831525 often patients are discharged from hospital but are unable to leave because they are waiting for a doctors letter a prescription or a ride home
831526 previously these patients would have waited in a ward usually on their bed but the transit lounge now provides them with a comfortable and relaxing place to wait that is also staffed by a full clinical team
831527 its lovely really nice hard to believe its part of the hospital

831530 that site is the biggest scam in the world they have made millions of dollars worldwide
831531 they are based out of arizona somewhere and are being sued by the united states olympic committee if they can even find them
831532 they are a complete fraud and anybody who gave them money off their website to unofficial people really are taking a hell of a risk

831535 considering the weather im rapt its a good turn out
831536 i have fed them together you can make enough milk to feed two babies its the easiest way to feed them
831537 its about the kids isnt it it should be the kids we should be counting
831538 we are over the moon with the turn out and really thrilled to see that mothers are feeling supported enough to be out in public breastfeeding
831539 the day breastfeeding is ho hum will be a great day because it will mean its normal and thats the way we feed our babies
831540 what are you going to do for me if i give you the job
831541 things can go wrong when those applying for jobs believe theyve been discriminated against because for example of their gender sexual orientation race religion or disability
831542 make it easier to tackle the employment situation and also enhance the standard of employment practices
831543 what i like about it is the simplicity its not about legal jargon its easy to understand
831544 it gives me so much confidence this is the first time i played really well in the united states its special its the biggest win of my life
831545 i know flores is a good player and was going to come back i was thinking oh hes going to come and get me
831546 i was really nervous the last couple of holes all i was thinking was dont make any mistakes and make pars
831547 i didnt play very well today i just didnt hit my iron shots close
831548 i expected to play really well in the united states i think ive done a great job
831549 the matter is being examined by the appropriate authorities in accordance with the normal processes in such situations
831550 it is hoped this planned facility will attract many visitors and enhance our schools programme which accommodates thousands of students each year with tours talks and educational packs all of which help demystify the courts process
831551 all we want is to make sure that courtroom is left untouched as it is sacrosanct in irish history because of its association with such historical and political figures as the invincibles the fenians and the 1916 volunteers
831552 welcome to the first dii document interoperability initiative workshop focused on our odf implementation we will be using this workshop to preview the work weve done implementing odf to give you an opportunity to try it out for yourselves and to get your feedback on the challenges and opportunities surrounding interoperability and odf
831553 when you go to google youll end up with a lot of search results and you need to sieve through them
831554 itll be good to have something that gets you what you need
831555 there are a lot of resources out there but there has to be quality control
831556 what were trying to do is take the burden away from the schools so they can focus on teaching and learning
831557 the idea is to build an edumall which is evaluated by its users so that good resources will be highlighted
831558 resources that arent so useful will sink to the bottom of the pile and can be removed as necessary
831559 as edumall grows its going to be very big and this is how people like to work online they want things to be personalised they want to talk to other people to have a home online and the personal space provides that
831560 independent learning for instance students dont always have to go through the teacher
831561 we talk a lot about remedial and enrichment work and it takes a lot of time not only for the teacher but also for students
831562 digitalisation is changing the way students learn and we have to accept that
831563 id like to thank the linkedin users for taking the time to respond to my question i appreciate your many thoughtful answers and would like to thank you for the kind words and good wishes i hope you will continue to support the rebuilding efforts in china to help deserving children find schools where they can learn in safety
831564 there are many similarities between the playing field and the boardroom both strategize their next move both are continually updating the tools of their trade both use key personnel to inspirit employees to reach success regardless of your profession the following key points can help you reach your potential
831565 the discipline of setting goals and constant evaluation of my performance and associated equipment related perfectly with business being pragmatic in meeting business objectives and benchmarking all of the critical factors of success is exactly the same in my sport a lot of the results were dependant on not just the athlete but the equipment training programmes diet etc measuring and evaluating what my competition was doing and using in small detail helped me to understand what factors were making the biggest impacts and also helped me asses my strengths and weaknesses
831566 as someone who has played sport rugby cricket at a high level but never professionally i have taken with me many qualities which you learn on the field team work leadership competitiveness resourcefulness cooperation dogmatism quick thinking and drive these things have helped me in my work life but were obviously noticeable when i did a year of teaching for 7 to 13 year olds
831567 yao finding my sport was tough as i believed that i had little athletic ability but when i began learning dressage i found my passion i learned see more that an athlete can be created with hard work and mental toughness the gift the sport and horses gave to me was self confidence and most of my life lessons i learned by experience riding
831568 yao ming yes playing sports growing up made a significant difference in the way i approach business today and still helps today when i get
831569 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
831570 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children

831583 i met saigon in 1997 and we were for lack of a better word classmates in the resurrection program but after a while we were teaching some of the classes and actually classmates isnt a bad word at all because we were learning
831584 we just want to get to the kids before they end up in jail we were all locked up before we realized our mistakes
831585 its about prevention and we target high risk black youth the music is an important component because we use that to entice them we just want to keep them from going down the same path we did
831586 saigon is part of this organization he is the face and he brings in a lot of our donations
831587 in arms reach abandoned nation represents a repatriation of the community of impoverished ghettos everywhere
831588 the wire and all the pieces matter five years of music from the wire
831589 problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together
831590 the wire and all the pieces matter five years of music from the wire
831591 you did some good work and we appreciate it but you need to fundamentally increase your scope if you want to continue advancing
831592 great job improve a few little things but keep it up
831593 show me a completely smooth operation and ill show you someone whos covering mistakes real boats rock
831594 if i want to sit down i dont throw myself onto the floor first to ensure the need for a chair
831595 the driver knew exactly what he was doing and that he would sacrifice himself and two young children is criminal
831596 i think professor hawking is mulling it over but a move isnt imminent
831597 he would not make plans to permanently move to a place he hasnt visited yet but he is open to it
831598 stephen hawking has no plans to leave the university of cambridge
831599 stephen has made an enormously important contribution to the university over the last 40 years both as a scientific leader in the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics and more generally as an inspirational communicator of science and mathematics to the wider public
831600 the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics and the university of cambridge are working together with stephen hawking to establish activities that continue his important contributions in the long term
831601 stephens hope is that this will soon be established as the worlds leading centre for research in theoretical cosmology and indeed that in due course will expand into a large permanent institute for research into fundamental physics
831602 having such an institute in cambridge continuing in the tradition of newton maxwell dirac and stephen hawking himself would be a fitting legacy of stephens long standing contributions to cambridge and to science
831603 we want to be able to say to the citizens of saskatchewan that we have a system where senators will be elected
831604 we are sorry we missed one that is special to you we have to balance our rotating calendar with the consistency of the google homepage
831605 this cant be even as a hoax oh my gosh
831606 i was literally shaking when i opened it even as a joke you simply dont do that
831607 as it looks at the present time it is a domestic homicide but we are examining all of the crime scene for any other possibilities
831608 this is a typical old type scan using new technologies
831609 this is a little different because these devices have actually been placed at banks
831610 we have looked over the complaint and find it has several serious errors of fact
831611 if a nation is to be taken seriously it has to have the ability and capacity to act it is just that simple
831612 if do not have the capacity to act then you give up your right to be a player at the table and you become a nation that no one listens to a nation that is smiled at and then ignored
831613 there is still an ongoing mission and part of that is a military aspect but much of the effort will be shifting to reconstruction and development
831614 the rumours are flying people are talking about sars nobody knows whats going on
831615 usually we only have two policemen here now i think weve got 20
831616 people of nova scotia need to know there are real potential risks in telephone service consisting of voip service especially in reporting real emergencies
831617 there are 18 charges against the 18 year old and 15 charges against the young offender
831618 in this case a group of men are accused of making and carrying bombs onto passenger planes flying from heathrow airport
831619 we should have our troops soon if not at this meeting of nato perhaps at the next nato meeting
831620 ms mowatt is very pregnant and shes now in a jail a place where we house people who have committed serious criminal offences
831621 the government keeps having gaffes like this that seem to keep growing by the hour
831622 the effort almost seems aimed to diminish the role of canada in the eyes of other nations
831623 we dont want to insult nations to make human rights progress we must engage these nations
831624 we dont need to be making comparisons of nazi germany and china all that can do is inflame and anger china and the chinese people
831625 many young people use the youtube sites and the internet each day this is just a different way of advertising the job opportunities we have here on the police department in vancouver
831626 this is the newspaper of the younger set and its a prime method of how young people today communicate
831627 these two boys are good students who made a poor choice a mistake
831628 it is just not possible for police to control what things kids learn or choose to make from the internet
831629 the internet itself is a great tool but you have to use it properly
831630 the union failed the public trust by striking without warning its highly irresponsible
831631 elderly were stranded young women were left alone without transportation at night it was highly irresponsible
831632 the proposed commercial site appears to be located very close to the river mouth i am concerned about the effect of this on salmon spawning
831633 i dont want to talk about it i wont discuss the possible sale to the government
831634 it has the ability to affect the fragile ecosystem in a negative way
831635 we were stopped in the water and the icebreaker rammed the stern end of our vessel the farley mowat and then they came back and rammed us again
831636 we reject these claims by this conservation group they are totally false the farley mowat is the vessel that struck the government coast guard icebreaker des groseilliers and it merely brushed up against our vessel
831637 the bright and educated younger generation of the country has never considered the hotel industry as a future employment option
831638 the traditional service industry of india has never witnessed growth like this before and hence it is not equipped to handle it
831639 the hotel industry is the most poorly paid industry in india
831640 as such skilled people often prefer to work abroad apart from the money the growth opportunity is also greater
831641 there is a lack of respect in our country if my superior is an indian he will treat me like a downtrodden and inferior person
831642 there are a lot many discriminations that limit growth opportunities here
831643 there have been hotel management institutes mushrooming all over the country
831644 however they somehow get affiliation with foreign universities and top notch catering colleges and go about the course in a short cut way
831645 there is no proper training or induction or a proper understanding of the hotel industry as a result there is faster burnout as people are clueless about what to expect leading to a high rate of attrition
831646 tobacco road showcases a more lyrically engaging ra scion over sabzis most creative and melodic compositions to date it is laden with heavy introspection and ra scions staunch personal convictions on life love and art with meaning but is noticeably absent of the feeling of pseudo evangelical idealism
831647 the album is not an easy read however and not fashioned to be fully digested in a single setting tobacco road is comprised of 18 tracks within which lie hidden gems that the listen will appreciate with dedicated discovery upon closer examination youll find the incorporation of seasonal progression in reference to the albums agricultural influence
831648 the wire and all the pieces matter five years of music from the wire
831649 if this dont go it dont go this is it for me im almost 30 ive been doing this and if i dont know how to do it by now and i cant make a platinum record ive failed
831650 the wire and all the pieces matter five years of music from the wire
831651 we got our 6th album comin out in september of this year and its chock full of all the musical dope you have come to love and expect from the p
831652 we have listed a series of east coast dates to help get the word out about the album and when it drops we will run up and down the west coast handling our business and rockin for you
831653 the wire and all the pieces matter five years of music from the wire
831654 the wire and all the pieces matter five years of music from the wire

831656 wait you mean we can have enchiladas without feeling bloated and crappy afterwards from gorging ourselves on a pound of cheese per person
831657 im four mommy please dont traumatize me for life so maybe ill want to have kids someday
831658 i want to read more stories about quinlan and mommy
831659 look at what i went through when you were young and this is the thanks i get
831660 then theres just nothing really good that i can come back with other than something about slim good body and prairie dogs and those just dont have the same sting that a pre op carnie wilson or droopers do
831661 that is a long time without oxygen what if he made it but was horribly brain damaged could i cope with it
831662 ok so what do we do about this im ready
831663 i dont want to be an advocate i want to be a mother
831664 you know she doesnt usually react to strangers that way must be something about you
831665 a woman is like a tea bag you can never tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water
831666 limit the amount of kids you have for the environment
831667 there are waaaay bigger problems than this to deal with first
831668 respect other families rights to have none one or a few kids
831669 if you dont mind me saying youre really big for being due in october
831670 well if youre comparing me to your dick then yes i am
831671 but youre so little are you sure you are really pregnant

831673 oh my god how many of them do you have in there

831677 well at least ill lose the weight eventually you unfortunately wont lose the stupid
831678 oh my god you are so freaking big for being due in october i think you are going to deliver early
831679 he enjoyed what he was doing and was proud to be in the army
831680 at the same time he knew the risks he wanted to remind me how very much he cared for his brothers and sisters
831681 the sunday drive with victor martinez kelly shoppach the tribe m a s h unit new prospects and manny
831682 well he didnt get the help he needed at golden state he was at sacramento wondering why he was the ninth guy in the rotation thus there are at elast two past stops in his nba career not just nellieball
831683 its hard for me to comment on something i know nothing about
831684 wound up getting a couple of stitches in his head
831685 these guys are supposed to be men we dont want our players hanging around with murderers
831686 this is not a kids league obviously weve got to take a hard look at the way weve been handling things here
831687 as a form of protest we vow to boycott any game next season in which the oklahoma city sonics play whether it be in our arena or watching it on television
831688 tell me one player on the suns who is worth double teaming
831689 artest part 1 why i like ron artest the basketball player
831690 i fall for you more everyday i wish we could always be together i love you
831691 is this my anti love cristina cristina believing in forever no dont listen to him hes probably said that before come back
831692 as far as what happened we cant say we have no idea at this point why
831693 it was less efficient than having the planes electronic transmission locator working but more efficient than not having any information
831694 this is one of those searches that could have gone on for days had we not had the cellphones stuff
831695 im really grateful that acting is the job that was chosen for me
831696 i get really lost when im not working i dont know what im supposed to do with myself thank god for dance class and the new york times crossword puzzle and american idol but acting is what i really have to do
831697 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
831698 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
831699 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a miles davis impression
831700 because it might make an impact to the texas shore were looking at activating resources including search and rescue and maybe military forces
831701 we were expecting the prime minister of canada to do the right thing the right thing was like the chinese head tax
831702 the apology has been given and it wont be repeated
831703 an important evolution in canadas relationship with our first peoples
831704 he just ate so he should be good for a week
831705 when we say a foot its kind of a speculation at this point
831706 what it was is it was a sock inside the shoe that appeared to contain decomposed flesh we dont know at this point whether thats animal whether its human or what it is
831707 were a little apprehensive since the last one was a hoax
831708 new and interesting species are still being discovered on caribbean islands despite the very small amount of natural forests remaining
831709 arrest is an instantaneous shattering thrust expulsion somersault from one state into another
831710 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labour but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all
831711 power is a poison well known for thousands of years if only no one were ever to acquire material power over others but to the human being who has faith in some faith that holds dominion over all of us and who is therefore conscious of his own limitations power is not necessarily fatal for those however who are unaware of any higher sphere it is a deadly poison for them there is no antidote
831712 we have to condemn publicly the very idea that some people have the right to repress others
831713 it is going to be uncomfortable horrible to live in such a country
831714 sometimes though you got thinking and your spirits soared your sentence was running out there wasnt much thread left on the spool lord just to think of it walking free on your own two legs
831715 standing there to be counted through the gate of an evening back in camp after a whole day of buffeting wind freezing cold and an empty belly the zek longs for his ladleful of scalding hot watery evening soup as for rain in time of drought he could knock it back in a single gulp for the moment that ladleful means more to him than freedom more than his whole past life more than whatever life is left to him
831716 shukhov felt pleased with life as he went to sleep
831717 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
831718 just one of the three thousand six hundred and fifty three days of his sentence from bell to bell
831719 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
831720 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
831721 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
831722 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
831723 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
831724 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
831725 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
831726 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
831727 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
831728 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
831729 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
831730 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
831731 the most important thing is that there are 25 30 million muslims in europe this figure has many implications
831732 the muslims keep having children while the europeans do not
831733 but the peoples of the west know nothing about the muslims statistics show that 70 do not know who the prophet of the muslims is the fact that muhammad is the prophet of the muslims is not known to many people in the west thats just one example
831734 not just his name but who he was even if they know that the name of the muslims prophet is muhammad they know nothing about him about his history when he lived and so on they know nothing about him
831735 the goal of the enemies of islam is to drive the 20 30 million muslims out of europe or to provoke them in a way that would lead to their banishment if the muslims remain in europe this will be dangerous so they must leave
831736 so you are making a very important claim that there are intentional and premeditated provocations in order to drive the muslims out of their current home europe
831737 people will tell you that denmark suffered economic losses and this is true so why does it continue because some believe that it is more beneficial to drive out the 30 million and that it outweighs the boycott so they are pushing in that direction
831738 each person should say i am an ambassador for islam and they should all take action throughout europe in the companies where they work in sports clubs and in any place where they can mingle and fit in with the europeans and where they can show them their moral values and success that will abolish the plan and the muslims will remain in europe we really need 10 years for the muslims in europe to become firmly established and very successful
831739 the goal of the enemies of islam is to drive the 20 30 million muslims out of europe or to provoke them in a way that would lead to their banishment
831740 i must get out of this box of islamic philosophy and look to it from others views
831741 an alien species whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health an
831742 insofar as a merguez sausage is called it must not contain pork
831743 i believe the cagots are descendants of moorish soldiers left over from the 8th century muslim invasion of spain and france thats why some people called them saracens i am quite dark and my daughter sylvia is the darkest in her class
831744 its okay for me to do it because little johnny did
831745 the god the sunni worship may not be described in human language nor represented in any art form for that would be blasphemous yet sometimes the human heart yearns for more for a faith you can touch and feel for drama for music for ceremony for great stories of sacrifice pain martyrdom and salvation and for someone to pray to who has human form shia islam answers these needs but the quran makes it so clear that your prayer should only be directed to god
831746 but do these specific beliefs have any substance in the quran the answer is no
831747 it is not the job of a critical and responsible media to condemn a group of muslims as heretics it is equally unacceptable to see a programme repeating the same anti shia polemic that is articulated by those jihadi extremists who justify their suicide bombings against the shia in iraq and pakistan
831748 they interviewed one ayatollah in iran and made the complex politics of iran sound like mainstream shiaism they really didnt show the diversity of opinion across the world
831749 the major food retailers have not yet grasped how to attract muslim shoppers one of our key objectives at ummah is to help the supermarkets develop and offer products that meet the ethical codes that most muslims want to abide by we are trying hard to encourage the major chains to think more creatively about how best to tap into this important market and to encourage more muslim women into their stores
831750 we asked muslim women in the uk what they would like us to do next and the unanimous call was for premium chocolates we listened carefully to their suggestions and are now very pleased to announce the launch of five new products in the ummah foods premium halal chocolate range
831751 as the uks first magazine for muslim women we respond to how muslim women in the uk today define themselves in this survey we wanted to hear their thoughts ideas and concerns so that we may better address these in our magazine
831752 sisters aims to satisfy the muslim womans varied needs spiritually intellectually emotionally and practically in a beautiful glossy package its our very own halal glamour
831753 all of us at sisters and at ummah foods are delighted with the responses we have received so far we have managed to get so much interesting information and the whole process has been a real eye opener for us as businesses and as part of the british muslim community we are definitely looking forward to doing another one next year
831754 finding a soul mate and settling down in a happy family environment were top of the womens list with 96 per cent of women saying that this is what marriage meant to them but they were also keen to find ways of successfully combining work with family life
831755 muslim girls are very conscious of the way they dress when you wear a headscarf you stand out as a muslim so what kind of message are you also sending out if you look drab or messy
831756 but since it began 10 months ago a lot of others have appeared
831757 we started using the hijab three years ago and it was very difficult to find any that fit into daily life in a western country
831758 we kept getting questions from other girls and women about where we had bought them
831759 parents can choose to perform the procedure on behalf of a small child
831760 that there is even a demand for this type of operation is appalling it is not illegal as long as it is voluntary but i personally do not believe that girls that approach the healthcare services for a hymen reconstruction do this voluntarily
831761 the young women which have been raped are so pressured that they can see only two paths to take one is suicide the other is hopelessness they are desperate and find nowhere in society that can help them
831762 is it reasonable that individuals through physical and psychological abuse can force surgical procedures to preserve and maintain a myth
831763 salaam halal insurance is the uks first dedicated islamic insurance provider set up to provide islamic insurance based on the shari ah principle of takaful

832026 very well said yes you are right someone needs to ask the hard questions heres a couple of question are these people interviewing or schmoozing are they playing interviewer or pr person
832027 what i find ironic in all this is when i say
832028 thank you for taking the time and effort to come up with this blog and the inner strength and courage that it takes to ask these hard questions
832029 i agree where is accountability i was listening not to long ago to a radio show that was nothing but a commercial for a convention then i hear them announce that next week they will have the same guest on for more convention ka fetching where is the research maybe if i cough up a bunch of dough i could be one of the lucky few to go an an investigation with them maybe then i will see their research i am right there with you guys accountability

832038 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
832039 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call
832040 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
832041 he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage
832042 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it
832043 i didnt think i could finish it there at the end
832044 it wasnt a good finish for me but i played really well today
832045 im turning 63s and 64s into 70s and thats kind of what happened today i couldnt get any putts to go in then in the end i made some bogeys

832057 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address hiv here at home
832058 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
832059 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
832060 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
832061 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
832062 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
832063 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective

832066 but its important that you dont die ok no dying you have light its nice and warm and the people are friendly well work on the flowers later
832067 its good that i screwed up the post doc so badly i know how it feels to have people look at me as unreliable and inept i didnt get invited to meetings because people werent sure id actually come they read my absences not as a personal struggle but as professional disinterest it made me feel worse about myself and i continued to withdraw and the situation continued to worsen
832068 i should get started on scaryproject ive been focused on areas that come easier to me but this week is devoted to the scary one

832082 baby boomers have this perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction as the data released today reveal marijuana is a much bigger part of our nations addiction problem than most people realize while teen marijuana use is down sharply adult use with all the social economic and health consequences that go along with it will not improve until we start being more honest with ourselves about the seriousness of this drug too many of us are in denial and it is time for an intervention
832083 we are facing a wave of criminal violence in mexico and central america that spills across our southern border into the united states
832084 in far too many instances parents directly enable their childrens underage drinking in essence encouraging them to risk their health and well being

832099 homeless people only have whats really dear to them what if they lose that
832100 thats not the same kind of people were helping right now
832101 some of them have been looking for a job for months and cant find a job
832102 the fact that these people dont have cars is a big problem
832103 its time for school to start somethings got to happen with these children as far as school
832104 we can use new underwear for men women and children
832105 we have an abundance of donations but were not able to get them processed
832106 i need doctors who will do some pro bono work
832107 its happening all over our country and all over our world
832108 some kind of temporary facility where we can house people
832109 i didnt think there were that many ships in the navy
832110 it was some kind of sight and we were all happy that war was over too
832111 the way the wind was blowing up we knew something bad was coming
832112 but we didnt know how bad it was going to be lord what a storm
832113 men were screaming and the wind was blowing and ill tell you ive never been so scared in my life
832114 my crew lost some men that night so i guess i can thank the good lord i wasnt one of them
832115 im not sure but it was a really nice thing that was some greeting
832116 i could run all those machines and i was good at it too i hated to go
832117 i wanted to see the world and thats what they promised
832118 he knew it was urgent and he did his part
832119 i was disappointed but it wasnt really anybodys fault it just didnt work out
832120 i didnt know what to expect but you could tell theyd fought a war there
832121 i was usually down in the engine room and didnt see it but once our guns got going you could tell we were in the middle of it and you knew we could be hit any time
832122 i dont know how he knew but it was pretty strange
832123 i was so happy i jumped in that fountain and got out my handkerchief and started polishing that thing up
832124 it was the closest id been to home in a long time
832125 there were plenty of planes in trouble but those men did a great job of getting them back down
832126 the man who ran that route told me id be crazy not to do it and he was right
832127 i am confident talks with chelsea will lead to a positive resolve about my future
832128 chelsea want to speak and i am open to talk
832129 things have not changed but i am a blues player
832130 money is not the main factor and if chelsea show they want me it is possible to accept a proposition
832131 water is a fabulous incentive for people to both compete and come out to spectate
832132 if we have a river like this again next year it will be absolutely fabulous
832133 in a small town where there was very little activity going on they thought that maybe hollywood had shown up
832134 one of mrs sewells directors came to our town and put on a nice play at the auditorium and my sister was quite interested
832135 my sister sent in an application and joined the company before i did
832136 my sister always had so many funny stories and tales to tell that i became interested in it too
832137 but behold they called and told me to come to atlanta i told them that i didnt know how id get there but id come one way or another
832138 he ushered me into it like i was a queen
832139 mr sewell was very dignified he had a big office there in atlanta so he just came down to the bus station it was a big thrill having him stand there to meet me
832140 we went through the whole script learning the choruses and the dances shed have us get up there and do the routines if we didnt do it right she said hold it and we tried again she was good at what she did a funny lady with a great sense of humor
832141 there was this log building we all stayed in which was quite bare but for the piano
832142 we had to wake up early in the morning and go through all the choruses ophelia would play the piano for us
832143 they kept us back in the woods we didnt get to come up to the gardens
832144 i remember we all slept in a big barn like building
832145 at night wed just pile up the quilts and the pillows spread them all out and thats where we slept it was a little bit rugged but it was fun
832146 those two buildings out in the woods that was our home
832147 now there was a little country store out here in roscoe that wed walk to to get our toothpaste and our candy bars and i think thats probably still around
832148 i tried to tell myself that id always wanted to go to arkansas id always heard that it was a beautiful prosperous place and that the people were so kind but i was just trying to make myself happy about it because the truth is that it was very hard
832149 the ladies all came out to meet me and they were very nice
832150 they were anxious to do anything they could to help me get situated i tried very hard to look seasoned
832151 any time of day during school i could ask for some boys to be sent over to rehearse and they were anxious to help
832152 if id say i need a white picket fence the boys would jump up and say i can do that
832153 this was in southern louisiana and there were an awful lot of cajuns in this town
832154 one of the very first places they took me to was a bar and this was at 10 oclock in the morning
832155 he said let me get you guys a little something
832156 so he begins to pour something and its very very dark and very very thick
832157 you deserve a good bulletin on that and one will be forthcoming
832158 we are staging only tantalizing tillie now not booking any other plays
832159 in a little while all the coaches will be trained in tantalizing tillie i expect to see you lead the role in this new play
832160 i do believe you are about the best money maker on the list today
832161 schools were always in need of extra funds and thats why they would want to do these shows
832162 but wed do things like prettiest baby in town it would be something like 5 to vote for the prettiest baby and the winning baby would get a silver cup
832163 i was sent to south alabama to do the first tantalizing tillie
832164 i was working with a school once again and they would not let me sell any ads
832165 but if we cant sell ads our profits are going to go way down and isnt that why you brought me here to help you raise money for the school
832166 i know the people around here arent going to be happy to see you coming
832167 and there was a certain melancholy aspect to it in that i knew i could only be with them for 10 days
832168 it was a great learning experience and i enjoyed seeing new parts of the country but i knew i could not travel forever i did not want to leave some of these wonderful people but i had no choice i was traveling all the time more or less living out of my trunk
832169 there was always some young man on hand to lift it up for me
832170 you know people in the small town where i grew up admired my sister and me very much
832171 and my father was especially proud wed have to give him a report of each state wed visit what it was like and what there was to do there
832172 but i remember we had a large front porch with a swing and wed sit out on the swing in the summer time
832173 and we had an especially lengthy session out there one night
832174 the people were so dear to take me into their homes like i was their daughter everyone was so very nice
832175 mrs sewell by the time i met her was a little chubby but she was still a tiny woman and very pretty
832176 looking at her pictures she was very pretty when she was young she was very friendly to me
832177 the club in general because we have got so many nippers right through to masters and weve got so many people that have been in the club for so long that it is one of those clubs that people stick to it and enjoy being there
832178 im surprised that they would have not known the risks involved in purchasing offshore
832179 we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find substitute tickets or whatever
832180 we went through the official website cosports and struggled initially to get any tickets in the first round and were very distraught because we have quite a large party here
832181 we were struggling to get two tickets for our family to the beach volleyball
832182 but weve managed through the help of the aoc and cosport to get everyone a seat right now
832183 accommodation here was very tough and very expensive flights were probably the easiest thing to get and to spend all that time effort money and to see family members to see your children play
832184 my parents would be distraught its their fourth olympics too
832185 i played in these conditions all week so maybe i was more used to it
832186 there were lots of long long rallies which took a toll and we were both tired at the end
832187 my wimbledon win against richard gasquet gave me a lot of confidence and this will give me even more
832188 following are my trip statistics ill also put a gear list together along with a list of what gear worked and what gear didnt make the grade

832196 this is the closest thing canada has seen to extraordinary rendition since maher arar was spirited to syria this is a violation of every principle of natural justice
832197 theres a big policy debate we should be having in addition to talking about the leadership
832198 following brain stem testing that was carried out earlier today ben mullany has now passed away the thoughts of all the staff who were involved in bens care are with his family at this very sad time
832199 the main thing i got out of my military experience was the realization that i am completely opposed to war every war is insane no matter where it is or what its about fighting is the lowest form of human behavior its amazing to me that with all the great teachers of literature and art and all the contributions that have been made on this very precious planet we still havent evolved a more humane approach to the way we work out our conflicts
832200 its hard to imagine that if canadians really understood the choices available theyd favour spending an extra 3 billion a year on the military rather than on their own children
832201 to enhance its ability to operate alongside u s forces
832202 every gun that is made every warship launched every rocket fired signifies in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed those who are cold and not clothed
832203 complex behaviours such as aggression and war cannot be said to be biologically driven or predetermined because humanitys most striking biological capability is flexibility
832204 is strongly in favor of cutting back military spending and directing the funds to social needs
832205 democratization may be a prerequisite for transferring military spending to social needs or at least they have to go hand in hand
832206 i think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of the way and let them have it
832207 land borders from the u s and cause irreparable harm to the canadian public
832208 john doe never presented himself at the canadian border and therefore never requested a determination regarding his eligibility
832209 there is in this case no factual basis on which to assess the alleged charter breaches
832210 that the u s does not actually comply is irrelevant
832211 the court of appeal has not addressed the fundamental human rights issues at stake in this case and has largely insulated the government from review by the court the courts finding on public interest standing is likewise a step backwards in effect the court of appeal is demanding that before a court can hear a challenge to the legality of the agreement a refugee must put her life at risk by coming to the border getting refused and handed over to u s authorities for likely deportation to torture or persecution this requirement is both impractical and dangerous
832212 we are deeply disappointed that the court condones the canadian government disregarding u s practices that place refugee lives in danger
832213 this judgment fails to give life to the promise of protection in the charter and in international human rights agreements which canada has signed
832214 sadly the court chose to focus on the scope of the review and questioned the right of the petitioners to bring forward such a challenge rather than on the human rights issues at stake for refugees
832215 the evidence shows that united states falls short of its responsibilities to protect refugees under international law it fell short of those responsibilities on the day the agreement was signed and has continued to fall short of these responsibilities to this day
832216 from now on when there is a strike no one notices
832217 whether president nicolas sarkozy lives in the same world like the rest of the french people
832218 eighty percent of the population live on 30 cents a day or less with billions of dollars going out the back door and into the pockets of mining companies
832219 they can use their enormous power to pressure their governments to take action on the congo
832220 the government has not succeeded in tackling inequality and educational failure
832221 they have spent hundreds of millions of pounds but the poorest children are still extremely unlikely to continue in education after gcses we need to get to the root causes of this inequality and it begins with the need to strengthen relationships and support families
832222 david cameron has already said he cannot guarantee the future of emas under a future conservative government and this latest attempt by michael gove to undermine them suggests they have a secret plan to cut this vital support for students on low and middle incomes
832223 as an independent evaluation from the institute for fiscal studies showed earlier this year ema has been a real success with young people from disadvantaged backgrounds more likely to stay on in education at 16 as a direct result
832224 we will build on this success and from next month every young person on ema will get a firm guarantee of financial support if they go on to university
832225 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
832226 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
832227 we are going to be in this for the long haul
832228 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight
832229 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
832230 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
832231 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response
832232 all i could see is the body covered up with another small body right next to it
832233 in one case a brother and sister say deputies unnecessarily stopped them in front of their north phoenix auto repair shop and forced them out of the car with weapons raised in another a husband and wife say sheriffs deputies improperly asked for a social security card after they encountered a roadblock while leaving bartlett lake with their two children the accusations were added wednesday to a federal lawsuit that alleges the maricopa county sheriffs office is targeting latinos to investigate immigration status by using unfounded traffic stops racially motivated questioning and baseless arrests in a series of crime sweeps
832234 a man named robert who has an hispanic last name served nearly two years in prison was deported got caught re entering was sentenced to three years in prison served more time and then was finally sent to an immigration judge he was later informed that he had been a citizen since 1983
832235 i f immigrants want to follow the law families often including u s spouses and children are left with two difficult choices live apart or move to mexico mautino said she knows of a few u s citizen spouses who have made the same decision as heather suarez but more choose not to move because of concerns about safety education medical care or finances
832236 the number of foreigners landing in los angeles immigration court has surged in recent years while the number of judges has remained about the same causing crushing caseloads and lengthy delays
832237 the justice department said wednesday it has opened an investigation into the fatal beating of a mexican immigrant in a small northeastern pennsylvania town the federal involvement comes less than a week after local officials in schuylkill county charged three white teens in this months attack in shenandoah on luis ramirez a 25 year old father of two
832238 for north carolinas hispanic leaders the biggest hazards of the job were once long hours now they include death threats a pair of the states most prominent advocates andrea baz n and tony asion say that for the past several months each time they have spoken publicly they have gotten a raft of profanity laced messages some of them exhorting them to return to their home countries and others denigrating hispanics several legislators say they have also gotten messages recently that cross the line into racism and one got a menacing voice mail
832239 ten weeks after the largest workplace immigration raid in u s history this is the new postville drunken brawls a food pantry that is almost bare women afraid to walk alone at night postville is now home to hundreds of men and women from tough towns and tough lives brought to this northeast iowa community by recruiters who entered homeless shelters in dusty texas border towns offering 15 and a one way bus ticket the impact is evident new laborers are changing postville the agriprocessors inc meatpacking plant the site of the immigration raid once employed men and women with families now its workers are mostly young single people with no stake in the community and nothing to lose
832240 a typical case is a 22 or 23 year old father of two who was brought here when he was 2 or 3 lived here his entire life went to las cruces high school and has two kids who are american citizens he gets say a dwi and all of a sudden his lack of status is discovered and he is sent back to mexico even though he knows nothing about the country has no family there and barely speaks spanish what else is he going to do but turn around and cross the border again and if he does and he gets caught thats a felony with real prison time and another deportation

832252 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories accordingly i ask that the credentials committee when it meets on august 24 to approve the delegates for the national convention pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
832253 as a candidate for the nomination i supported the dncs efforts to establish and enforce a schedule for primaries and caucuses that would broaden the opportunity for democrats from all regions of the country and all backgrounds and walks of life to have a meaningful voice

832260 but if its dr wan azizah giving up her seat that people can accept its a wife a family member offering up her own seat to her husband
832261 she beat an umno veteran wanita umno deputy chief datuk seri shahrizat jalil for her seat she has demonstrated that she can perform and has potential to be a politician on her own
832262 they will say hes going back there because of course hell win it
832263 they anwar and wife are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
832264 permatang pauh is anwars home ground no matter what there will always be a core of people who will support the hometown boy

832328 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
832329 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
832330 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling

832336 why obama chose to disclose he smoked marijuana and used cocaine at all remains a mystery
832337 perhaps obama felt the information would eventually come forward from his school buddies so to minimize the damage from this concealed fact obama possibly judged self disclosure was the best route
832338 id looked at him standing there surrounded by big slabs of salami and roast beef and right then an image popped into my head of an air bubble shiny and round like a pearl rolling quietly through a vein and stopping my heart
832339 did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois
832340 how about in the u s senate if obama quit using drugs the public inquiry certain to occur in a general election campaign for the presidency will most certainly aim at the when how and why questions george w bush successfully avoided

832345 violence is down to its lowest level since the spring of 2004 and were now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
832346 a significant reason for this sustained progress is the success of the surge
832347 this operation is iraqi led our forces are playing a supporting role
832348 has been one of the hardest areas to control since the u s led war began in march 2003
832349 we remain a nation at war al qaeda is on the run in iraq but the terrorists remain dangerous and they are determined to strike our country and our allies again
832350 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
832351 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
832352 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
832353 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
832354 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
832355 the scientific community is really going to run with this
832356 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

832362 barack obama s 10 point plan to change the second amendment
832363 barack obama is going to demand that you shed your cynicism
832364 i want you to be in my wedding but you dont look good enough yet heres some things we need to fix
832365 i will win the war reduce the price of gasoline balance the budget fix social security and medicare stop global warming and see that every american has a decent job
832366 my opponent will lose the war is responsible for high gasoline prices will spend us into bankruptcy and will do nothing to fix social security or stop global warming
832367 simply managing their network they had arbitrarily picked an application and blocked their subscribers access to it
832368 poses a potential competitive threat to comcasts video on demand service
832369 disappointed in the commissions divided conclusion because we believe that our network management choices were reasonable
832370 raises significant due process concerns and a variety of substantive legal questions
832371 i agree that we do have jurisdiction in general over these areas however we do not have any rules governing internet network management to enforce
832372 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
832373 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
832374 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
832375 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
832376 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
832377 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
832378 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
832379 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
832380 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
832381 if the mountain cannot go to muhammad mohammed must come to the mountain
832382 we are scholars here a billion dollars in tuition has nothing to do with accreditation
832383 its very disappointing that its gone this way in the student loan industry
832384 lenders have been having a hard time raising enough capital to continue making loans
832385 the whole problem in the capital markets started with mortgages and has drifted down
832386 difficulty in the capital markets in the last few months has made it extremely difficult for us to secure funding for the fall season
832387 the financial aid office sent me all the information that i needed to know and they assured me that if i followed the steps id be all set
832388 i would have much rather taken out a loan there than somewhere where i didnt know anyone
832389 everyones on the same page no one wants to see a student denied any access to a federal student loan
832390 us banks likely to fail as bad lo economicson august 3 2008 at 7 30 pm

832393 part of an army scientists warped plan to test his cure for the deadly toxin
832394 so even if ivins was involved how would a high government official know that a rogue bioweapons scientist was going to go postal with anthrax if that high government official was not himself involved
832395 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its now five year investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
832396 there is no constitutional requirement for a president to issue a new executive order whenever he wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order rather than violate an executive order the president has instead modified or waived it
832397 no one disputes that a president can withdraw or revise an executive order at any time
832398 but abrogating a published executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law
832399 because the published order stays on the books it actively misleads congress and the public as to what the law is
832400 on rare occasions national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret
832401 but it can never justify lying to the american people about what the law is maintaining two different sets of laws one public and one secret is just that deceiving the american people about what law applies to the governments conduct
832402 soaring energy bills set to push inflation to 16 year high

832407 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
832408 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
832409 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
832410 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

832415 justification for extending the campaign against international terrorism to iraq washington singled out iraq north korea iran syria and libya of violating the international treaty banning weapons of germ warfare
832416 confirms that the us has built an extensive arsenal of biological weapons in blatant violation of international laws and covenants
832417 respected scientists on both sides of the atlantic warned that the us is illegally developing a new generation of weapons that undermine and possibly violate international treaties on biological and chemical warfare
832418 us armed forces push for offensive biological weapons development genetically engineered microbes that attack items such as fuel plastics and asphalt
832419 are probably only the tip of the iceberg the national academies are also concealing related documents after the sunshine project requested copies on march 12 2002 they placed a security hold on the public file
832420 the research proposed by the air force and navy raises serious legal questions under the 1989 us biological weapons anti terrorism act development of biological weapons including those that attack materials is subject to federal criminal and civil penalties
832421 proposed research for a new fort detrick homeland security center may violate an international ban on biological weapons and encourage other countries to follow
832422 vast germ warfare laboratory intended to help protect the us against an attack with biological weapons but critics say the laboratorys work will violate international law and its extreme secrecy will exacerbate a biological arms race by accelerat ing work on similar facilities around the world

832425 program constitutes clear violations of the international 1972 bwc arms control treaty ratified by the united states in 1975
832426 parties to this convention are determined to act with a view to achieving effective progress towards general and complete disarmament including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction and convinced that the prohibition of the development production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological biological weapons and their elimination through effective measures will facilitate the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control

832428 acquiring growing modifying storing packaging and dispersing classical emerging and genetically engineered pathogens
832429 the possibility of a man made disaster either accidental or deliberate for the entire world
832430 among our many initiatives we are continuing to develop more forward looking analyses to include red teaming efforts to understand new scientific trends that may be exploited by our adversaries to develop biological weapons and to help position intelligence collectors ahead of the problem
832431 red teaming means that we actually have people out there on a red team plotting planning scheming and conspiring how to use biowarfare
832432 impossible to distinguish between defensive and offensive research in the field
832433 scores of us universities and biotechnology companies since 2001 have benefitted handsomely from billions of dollars in biodefense cash across the country biodefense labs are sprouting up like weeds the unrelenting spigot of federal money has thousands of scientists and technicians
832434 sabotaged the verification protocol for the bwc and fully intend s to engage in research development and testing of illegal and criminal offensive biowarfare programs
832435 the costliest most grandiose research scheme ever attempted with germ warfare capability going forward under president bush and in defiance of
832436 germ warfare was an isolated happenstance todays efforts elevate it to an instrument of deadly and loathsome policy
832437 it is time for the world to change gods hand behind bird flu virus
832438 a signatory to the biowarfare convention and does not conduct bioweapons research
832439 outlines how and why the united states government initiated sustained and then dramatically expanded an illegal biological arms buildup
832440 represent s a significant emerging danger to our population and threaten s international relations among nations
832441 are always called defensive but with biological weapons defensive and offensive programs overlap almost completely
832442 boyle also sheds new light on the motives for the 2001 anthrax attacks the media black hole of silence about them and why the fbi may never apprehended the perpetrators of this seminal crime of the 21st century
832443 a catastrophic biowarfare or bioterrorist incident or accident is a statistical certainty
832444 to provoke war cheney considered proposal to dress up navy seals as iranians and shoot at them
832445 if you get the right incident the american public will support
832446 are we playing high school with you know 5 000 nuclear warheads in our arsenal yeah we are were playing you know whos the first guy to run off the highway with us and iran
832447 google says privacy doesnt exist get used to everyone knowing everything about you
832448 todays satellite image technology means that even in todays desert complete privacy does not exist
832449 plaintiffs live in the 21st century united states where every step upon private property is not deemed by law to be an actionable trespass unless there is a clear expression such as a gate fence or keep out sign indicating that the public is not permitted to enter anyone may approach a home by a walkway driveway or any other route commonly used by visitors without liability for trespass

832454 i can say that we work with amazon similar to the way many of their affiliates do we participate on a revenue share basis but i cant disclose the exact terms but one thing worth mentioning is that amazon sells tivos so were motivated to sell amazon services and theyre motivated to sell tivo services
832455 were always looking at ways to expand shopping options for customers
832456 were looking to create some initial success with amazon theyre already a partner of ours and they have excellent customer service
832457 were interested in talking to programmers as well as advertisers to enable more impulse buys when it make sense
832458 because we do not believe as a whole that it is responding urgently enough to the massive dislocations these new dynamics will create easy commercial avoidance in the next two to three years will create such an overwhelming challenge to the economics of television that it will rock the very foundation of the industry it may well make what the newspaper industry is going through today seem like a minor tremor comparison

832536 a huge number of children throughout the world hit by the aids virus will live because of this idea
832537 these new figures should bring new focus to our efforts to address aids and hiv here at home
832538 combating hiv aids also demands closing the gaps in opportunity that exist in our society so that we can strengthen our public health we must also overcome the stigma that surrounds hiv aids a stigma that is too often tied to homophobia
832539 we need to encourage folks to get tested and accelerate hiv aids research toward an effective cure because we have a moral obligation to join together to meet this challenge and to do so with the urgency this epidemic demands
832540 work closely with non profit government and private sector stakeholders to continue the fight against hiv aids
832541 by focusing efforts on reducing drug costs through greater market competition promoting prevention efforts encouraging testing targeting communities with high infection rates strengthening research and reducing disparities through effective public outreach we as a nation can make great progress in fighting hiv aids
832542 these data which are based on new laboratory technology developed by cdc provide the clearest picture to date of the us hiv epidemic and unfortunately we are far from winning the battle against this preventable disease
832543 we as a nation have to come together to focus our efforts on expanding the prevention programs we know are effective
832544 aids is the most complex the most challenging and probably the most demanding infectious disease humanity has ever had to face
832545 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
832546 we are going to be in this for the long haul
832547 its certainly far too early for declaring victory because the end of aids is nowhere in sight

832590 well thats ego and everyone could see it and hear it and touch it
832591 the ego is false and as such needs to be defended if it were real that he needed to say it he could have gone to the w c and said it 1 000 times till feeling better in private thats the ego its false but it is not invisible
832592 now when he goes to the w c and attends the true call of his nature he really feels better after getting rid of his toxic produce thats reality it does not need to be defended he knows its toxic and offensive and puts it away in private without pride

832596 the fall release will bring more intelligence and semantics to the surface for example we will let anyone define a new type of thing such as a recipe or baseball team form to author its more like what freebase does and we will also likely integrate with freebase over time
832597 a major focus of our work is on personalization and recommendations
832598 ultimately twine is about interest networking and is a content distribution network people declare their interests add content join twines and connect with people as users work with the system it learns about their interests using artificial intelligence and semantic web technologies to provide more relevance we are not attempting to index the whole web just the best stuff of interest to users ninety nine percent of whats on the web is not interesting to a user so its more about high signal to noise
832599 the goal for twine is to be the place on the web that best understands your interests and represents them to others the key is to give users control and privacy

832603 this is where linked data shines if we find a way to link from crunchboard to crunchbase we can use semantic web technology to run queries that include both sources and with sparqlscript we can construct and leverage these links below is a script that first loads the crunchboard feed of current job offers only the last 15 entries due to common rss limitations practices the use of e g hatom could allow more data to be pulled in in a second step it uses the company name to establish a pattern join between crunchboard and crunchbase which then allows us to retrieve the list of matching jobs at stage a companies with offices in california

832958 we just saw him as a world class athlete i do a bit of buying and selling and he was a horse that really caught my eye a couple of years ago

832960 hes in work now well do some dressage and jumping shows over the winter and just start in some lower horse trials in the early spring and progressively build our way up to get my three and four star qualifications again

833038 as chairman in office of the committee of ministers of the council of europe i note with great satisfaction the decision taken by the constitutional court not to ban the ruling akp
833039 the decision opens up for further reforms ensuring turkeys further progress in line with european norms of democratic governance human rights and the rule of law the council of europe stands ready to assist in this process
833040 i also invite the turkish authorities to make use of the council of europes expertise
833041 i am very pleased to note that the attempts to carry out in the guise of legal action what would in effect have been a coup against the elected government in turkey have today been rejected
833042 to play basketball while bryan steinhauer is lying in a hospital bed is the height of callousness and shows that mr kovacevic clearly doesnt understand the severity of his actions
833043 he needs to be returned to the united states immediately to fully account for what he has done
833044 has that effect in terms of being a federal agency we are restricted by it
833045 that there would be significant consequences for serbia if this matter was not resolved
833046 it is imperative that the serbian government remedy these outrageous actions committed by its official representative igor milosevic and ensure the immediate return of miladin kovacevic to the united states for further legal proceedings and trial not later than aug 1 2008
833047 sweden welcomes the appointment of the south african judge navanethem pillay as new un high commissioner for human rights

833049 i welcome the fact that the parties in zimbabwe have now declared their agreement on the framework for negotiations to find a solution to the deep crisis in zimbabwe this is an important first step however in order to succeed the parties need to be serious in their desire to achieve results
833050 if zimbabwe is to have a legitimate and democratically accepted government it is important that the negotiations are based on the outcome of the parliamentary elections on 29 march and that that result is respected continued international pressure is also required as regional organisations the au and the sadc in particular have a key role to play in this
833051 i remain concerned about developments in zimbabwe and the people there every day we see examples of human rights violations and the humanitarian situation is becoming increasingly serious the prohibition against humanitarian organisations operating in zimbabwe must be cancelled as soon as possible the government sponsored violence against the civilian population and members of the opposition must stop immediately

833077 you know the one that obscure and evidently antiquated lesson we once referred to as the powell doctrine the one which says whatever you do dont send a mere 130 000 troops to a country the size of iraq or youll be sorry well guess what stephen were all sorry now and not because you republicans are in denial but because you republicans are inept
833078 his outstanding contributions to the formulation of united states economic policy
833079 the artisan of a renewal in economic science and policy after half a century of state interventionism
833080 a timely masterpiece that will have real impact on economic thinking in the years ahead
833081 the next 12 to 24 months are going to be extremely telling in the world of document formats the myopia around the standardization process of open xml will fade as software producers continue to invest their development budgets in the creation of solutions the specification itself is only the start it is the implementations and the competition in the marketplace of broader solutions that will continue to matter more in my opinion the continued interest in innovation presented by those solutions will speak much louder than the formats themselves
833082 icomparable lt gt equals in explicit interface declaration is not a member of interface
833083 both the interoperability specification pledge from ibm on for instance odf v1 0 v1 1 and suns covenant not to sue suffer from the same issue with gpl as microsofts osp licensing gpl3 code can be reused outside the limits of those rand licenses any patent protection by ibm and sun on opendocument and from micrsoft on ooxml will not apply if the gpl code is reused in a project that does not fall under those licenses as suns covenant only applies to opendocument reuse of patent protected code from an odf code for anything else but an odf implementation voids the covenant
833084 but they do it and its all right for them
833085 this fear is totally founded in microsofts well documented habits
833086 im pleased that this osp is compatible with free and open source licenses
833087 red hat believes that the text of the osp gives sufficient flexibility to implement the listed specifications in software licensed under free and open source licenses we commend microsofts efforts to reach out to representatives from the open source community and solicit their feedback on this text and microsofts willingness to make modifications in response to our comments
833088 what i consider to be a highly desirable tool for facilitating the implementation of open standards in particular where those standards are of interest to the open source community
833089 the better long term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle
833090 the big problem everyone has with ms promise and ooxml is that this risk is inherently overwhelming that at some point microsoft will take someone be it a community or alternate vendor to task over patent or licensing infringement this fear is totally founded in microsofts well documented habits surely i dont need to provide anyone with this history
833091 legal snags like the ones i mentioned only matter if someone presses it in a court case
833092 nice little collection of documents you have there it would be a pity if something were to happen to it so why dont you buy a little insurance
833093 the point im making is not about the conflicts but about how people treat those conflicts they ignore them
833094 notice gnumeric has included open xml support even though it is gpl licensed
833095 in addition mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program or with a work based on the program on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license
833096 inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate
833097 so is there any mingling of gpl mpl epl code in linux how about the rest of the licenses purported to conflict with the gpl
833098 in my experience open source projects are very careful about using only compatibly licensed software when they incorporate third party packages
833099 this message is merely a warning there may not actually be any conflict because the two licenses may not apply to the exact same sections of code you should review the license requirements for this project carefully especially if you are using this code for commercial purposes
833100 this software is licensed under one of the following licenses
833101 the concern regarding ooxml is it does not allow you to be vendor agnostic for the full impletation unless i am missing something if you were to use every bell and whistle in the specification it does require you to accept addtional restrictive licensing
833102 if the ooxml is broken as is the case in office 2007 my only resonable option is not to use it
833103 it is an automated search for the license names appearing anywhere in the source tree not an intelligent evaluation
833104 while not all of those are going to be actual conflicts probably most arent
833105 the same folks who will jump up and down and say the osp causes concerns are then okay with the troubles elsewhere and i have a feeling that it is not
833106 legal snags like the ones i mentioned only matter if someone presses it in a court case
833107 nice little collection of documents you have there it would be a pity if something were to happen to it so why dont you buy a little insurance
833108 how do you get from gaining a most valuable professional mvp award at microsoft to be threatened with legal action
833109 is lack of standards compliance an anti trust issue the opera folks think so yesterday the norwegian browser maker submitted an anti trust complaint against microsoft to the european commission we are filing this complaint on behalf of all consumers who are tired of having a monopolist make choices for them
833110 in addition to promoting the free choice of individual consumers we are a champion of open web standards and cross platform innovation we cannot rest until weve brought fair and equitable options to consumers worldwide
833111 in light of those blinders it is worth your time to look at a blog post from jan van den beld it is an educational post if you dont know who he is he was secretary general of ecma
833112 strange that a website setup by ibm to fight a proxy war during the sco case would be so focused on the open xml discussion today
833113 strange that a website setup by ibm to fight a proxy war
833114 but it is clear from my content and from the way in which my blog is quoted that i do so as an employee of microsoft my affiliation is in the clear
833115 strange that a website setup by ibm to fight a proxy war during the sco case
833116 my assertion in the preeceeding paragraph is my opinion take it or leave it a face value please
833117 yet in the case of open xml it seems that participation by those in favor of open xml only happened through pernicious activities and breeched ethics while participation against open xml was purity and light personified i just dont get that
833118 i know it may be very cynical but there it is
833119 eso es producto de otra cosa los linchamientos eso es producto de la impunidad y ya yo lo he expresado varias veces
833120 in light of the amount of gasoline production and pipeline capacity eliminated by hurricanes katrina and rita and the inelastic response of consumer demand to gasoline price changes the post hurricane gasoline price increases at the national and regional levels were approximately what would be predicted by the standard supply and demand model of a market performing competitively
833121 the u s federal trade commission monday said it has found 15 cases of gasoline price gouging in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita last year
833122 congress told the ftc to define price gouging as an instance when the average price of gasoline in september 2005 post hurricane katrina was higher than the average price of gasoline in that same area in august 2005
833123 for a person with income y give him f y on his national id card at the beginning of the year and let him spend it as he will then if a hurricane comes and he has already spent it all tough luck he should have made better choices
833124 effect a few people with blatant requests for money will be ignored but if literally every citizen in the country has a card and gets money on it from time to time for different reasons those calls are going to happen more and more often

833130 the gladesville property was the home of one of keli lanes former boyfriends and she is known to have attended this location briefly on the day she was discharged from hospital
833131 as a result of further inquiries over almost two years we have uncovered information which suggests tegans remains may be at this location
833132 this work is expected to take up to a week and will also include a search of the entire property
833133 i had no idea i had to get a permit i just assumed you could have a photo taken in a public place for free

833137 sometimes i am simply ashamed of harvard for being so damn irrational early admissions policy this sort of poor leadership isnt sustainable eventually harvards prestige will suffer as a result

833140 i want to be a part of your family ive been away too long im ready to come home
833141 do use the most derived type for return values and the least derived type for input parameters for example take ienumerable as an input parameter but return collection lt string gt as the return type
833142 a collection that is read only does not allow the addition removal or modification of elements after the collection is created
833143 if isreadonly were true then people who programmed to the interface will assume that the instance they have is only readable and might rely on the guarantees that this provides
833144 this collection will support add remove because isreadonly is false guaranteed i swear
833145 now you might argue that isreadonly should be false and we should support only the ilist lt t gt mutator and throw on icollection lt t gt s but thats equally as odd then you have people who might check the isreadonly predicate before mutating to decide whether its safe to do so but if they used add insert or removeat theyd fail at runtime this defeats the purpose of having isreadonly on the interface that is to program generically against it one could make the argument that since isreadonly is on icollection lt t gt then ilist lt t gt s new methods arent required to follow it but in practice we do make those guarantees
833146 we started off with a head of steam but pricing has come back into line with the performance of both equity and commodity markets on friday

833154 following the elections of a reformist president khatami and majlis in the late 1990s attempts to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction floundered as conservative politicians prevented reform measures from being enacted increased repressive measures and made electoral gains against reformers parliamentary elections in 2004 and the august 2005 inauguration of a conservative stalwart as president ahmadinejad completed the reconsolidation of conservative power in irans government
833155 implementation of the npt safeguards agreement in the islamic republic of iran

833408 tensions boiled over in eastern ontario near deseronto ont friday when one of the protesters of a land claim dispute near that community shawn brant was arrested during a traffic stop
833409 police say they saw a long gun being pointed at them from a location inside an occupied quarry which protesters have controlled since march 2007
833410 an order was issued to all police personnel on the scene to take cover and guns were drawn by officers crouching behind their vehicles but no shots were fired
833411 protester jason maracle said they will refuse all orders to leave what they consider to be mohawk land
833412 the opp asked protesters to leave the site or face arrest
833413 theyre going have to kill every god damn one of us to get us off our land were not moving i guess if they want another 1990 scene then ok i guess well have one
833414 in the interest of public safety the officers established roadblocks to permit limited access to the area
833415 opp commissioner julian fantino last night said the dispute is not a land claims issue
833416 this violent criminal activity occurred outside of any legitimate protest and will not be tolerated
833417 police officers being assaulted and injured for doing their utmost to keep the peace and protect the law abiding community is unacceptable
833418 protesters inside a quarry protest site told the sun last night they were worried a confrontation was imminent
833419 they are sending the media away so we are worried they are going to take us all out
833420 we are not doing anything all we are doing is sitting here holding out land there is nothing wrong with that
833421 the opp said they were concerned when officers spotted a long gun pointed at them from within the quarry native protesters deny this
833422 several witnesses confirmed the opp had up to 150 officers and 50 vehicles already on site in this town 50 kms west of kingston near the mohawk territory
833423 the commissioner went on to say opp had not trapped anybody in the quarry nor pulled or aimed guns among other things
833424 i think its inflaming what is already a very tenuous very difficult situation he said
833425 the criteria for calling in the true team is a threat to life
833426 suspended police chief larry hay of the tyendinaga mohawk police services once said that an injustice cannot be remedied by the rule of law his recent suspension in which this publication played a small part serves only to highlight the difference in philosophies that exist on either side of the figurative barricades when it comes to policing and justice
833427 the actions of the tyendinaga mohawk police service at the quarry occupation site and at the railway blockade is proof that first nations policing works there were no physical confrontations between police and demonstrators between demonstrators and their detractors or between the detractors and police unlike in caledonia where the opp used different tactics to try to keep the peace first nations policing is proving its worth by facilitating a peaceful resolution and focusing on communication rather than confrontation
833428 i am calling on all persons to act in a respectful manner and to build upon relationships within our communities commissioner fantino stated

833456 today we are one voice we are one spirit we are one body the two walks brought together many different people from many different parts of this country from different reservations from different communities from different walks of life but today we have brought this pair together as one prayer a prayer for the sacred mother earth a prayer for future generations a prayer for the earth
833457 the manifesto is the result of this five month journey to gather support for a call to action to protect our sacred sites and to clean up mother earth and deliver the voice of the people to congress and demand congress to act
833458 most of these issues are identical to those encountered by the original walk in 1978 both manifestos attest to the affirmation of the sovereignty and ongoing resistance of indigenous peoples the lack of responsible action will no longer be tolerated the manifesto is a demand for immediate responsible action
833459 the committee on the judiciary will hold hearings on each one of these items that you have outlined here
833460 i dont want anybody in the congress or in the united states of america to ever forget that this was your land this still is your land
833461 all of us come together to join hands for one simple obvious reason that weve learned your cause is our cause
833462 for those of us that survived the first walk we never stopped walking for me its taken me all over the world all over the world theyre struggling for the same things that were struggling for here as indigenous peoples we face a common threat extermination through corporatization we no longer face individual nations and nation states they work together through something called canzus it stands for canada new zealand australia and the us theyre the same four countries that did not sign the declaration for the rights of indigenous people we need to coordinate our struggles and we need to maintain our tribal sovereignty we need to redefine internationalism to maintain our own identity as indigenous peoples of this world
833463 so you have an awesome responsibility some people are saying what kind of protest is this were not protesting were walking for mother earth were walking for things that should be right thats what were walking for native people we will always take up the gauntlet we will never lie down in the face of struggle if we have to keep walking this continent well walk it again

833538 from the very beginning ive had real concerns about the quality of the investigation
833539 given the fact that they already paid somebody else 5 million for the mistakes they must have made gives you some indication of the overall caliber and quality of the investigation
833540 this probably further complicates their ability to get to the facts
833541 is just another false track and a real diversion of where they need to be we dont know and they arent telling us

833553 u s economy grows at solid pace in 2nd quarter
833554 much of the improvement came from the one time bump from economic stimulus payments raising prospects of weaker performance in months ahead
833555 looking at it from the government point of view theres a strong political motivation to understate the cpi by understating it keeps cola adjustments down on entitlements which are at this point the largest part of the governments budget and by understating cpi the government can minimize the inflationary impact on things such as rents which are indexed to cpi or wages pensions and a whole list of ancillary costs to artificially keep inflation rates down bottom line the published cpi understates the real inflation rate
833556 while sometimes devastating these global relative price pressures are not the same thing as inflation
833557 the fed remains skeptical that high commodity prices will ripple through the economy leading to broad price hikes and big wage increases
833558 as consumers spend more money for higher priced petroleum and agricultural goods they eventually have less money to spend on other goods and services other relative prices must then fall
833559 fingered exploding inflation as the biggest risk to the economy
833560 products of public policies which deeply affect markets supply and demand consumers producers and speculators
833561 declining capitalist investment in the productive economy the vast increase of capital flowing in the paper economy the huge increases in profits and the grotesque salaries bonuses and payoffs to senior executives totally unrelated to performance
833562 in other words in the contemporary economy inflation benefits the wealthy because they pay their workers in deflated currency while they can take advantage of inflation to further jack up prices and then income thus the upper classes have fortified their economic positions to take account of inflation through their power over prices income and other compensations in a way that wage workers and people on fixed income and other vulnerable sectors cannot bankers protect their loans via adjustable interest rates monopoly resource owners jack up prices to retain profits wholesalers mark up prices to compensate for higher commodity prices large scale retailers squeeze final consumers the great majority at the bottom of the production and distribution chain
833563 in asia particularly pakistan india indonesia south korea philippines nepal mongolia and china hundreds of millions of workers peasants artisans and low paid self employed workers as well as housewives and pensioners have engaged in sustained mass protests as they experience a decline in the quality and quantity of food purchases as prices skyrocket in africa hunger stalks the land and major food riots have occurred from egypt through sub saharan africa to south africa in the caribbean central and south america food riots have led to the overthrow of regimes mass protests road blockages from argentina bolivia through colombia venezuela and haiti

833565 when i was serving a sentence on robben island during the struggle to end apartheid in south africa i never suspected that the end of white minority rule in my home country would be the beginning of yet another struggle for justice this time against the world bank and the international monetary fund
833566 as architects of the global economy the world bank and the imf have enormous power and shape the conditions of peoples lives around the world
833567 i live now in the united states where people so far are relatively unscathed by the reordering of the global economy for the benefit of the very rich
833568 the imf and world bank with the structural adjustment programs saps they impose on indebted countries and their pro corporate development projects are the leading edge of oppressive globalization the policies they have imposed in africa latin america and asia have condemned people to stagnation poverty and death for twenty years and those policies are now being adopted in the countries of europe and north america too
833569 although some of them may have tricked themselves into believing that the neo liberal economic model they defend is immutable like a law of nature most of them probably know that they are perpetrating a fraud of global proportions michael camdessus who retired after thirteen years as managing director of the imf told a group of u s religious leaders that he was willing to sacrifice a generation in order to realize the so called benefits of the macroeconomic model
833570 given the reluctance of india and other developing nations to sacrifice food security measures in the wake of the recent global spike in food prices
833571 the tariff cuts demanded of developing countries would have caused massive job loss and countries would have lost the ability to protect farmers from dumping further impoverishing millions on the verge of survival
833572 we see many of the essential ingredients for a classic asset bubble said edward morse chief energy economist at lehman brothers morse estimated that 90 billion has flowed into the biggest commodity indices in just more than two years and more money has flowed into other exchanges pushing up prices
833573 the cftcs economists are saying that supply and demand seem to be driving this but we have clients in the business that have experienced these markets for many many years and what im hearing from them is that they dont see any change in the fundamentals of supply and demand
833574 is it a matter of institutional investors seeking shelter from the subprime crisis and the credit crunch
833575 i dont know but i do know that speculators as a class do not agree on anything and yet there is almost unanimity of opinion these days and the money to make the opinions matter the fact that prices have been relentlessly trending up suggests a new type of market participant with a mentality that is traditionally more in line with investing in securities than trading in commodities if enough of these wealthy people or funds or other entities with a lot of capital decide to flip out of securities for a little while and go into commodities and theyre all looking for something that is going up and you get enough billions of dollars thinking that way then their wish comes true
833576 the situation now is that the cftc is sitting there looking at one screen one piece of the picture which is whatever is happening on the exchanges meanwhile an increasing volume in dollars is taking place in the form of over the counter activity where no one can see it there is still a blind spot with respect to the true over the counter activity that is going on which represents billions and billions of dollars
833577 in 2000 congress decided that there were certain kinds of high end investors that were big enough and smart enough that they shouldnt be constrained to do all their business on the exchanges

833616 i thought youd be dead but given that its you i suppose that was too much to ask for
833617 i fail to see how being naked except for a tight leather collar with the leash in your hand and with candles just out of my reach qualifies as comfortable

833689 i am pro israel and believe that america must consistently support our trusted ally israel part of that support should be helping to promote serious efforts to advance israeli palestinian peace because ending the conflict is vital to israels future and security i disagree with american politicians who make statements such as demanding we move the u s embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem that sound supportive of israel and make vocal activists happy yet really undermine both peace efforts and americas role as a mediator i will always work to maintain the special relationship between the u s and israel and i support policies that help israel achieve an enduring peace

833692 let me not look upon the death of the 17 year old child

833694 o my son i see in vision that i offer thee in sacrifice now see what is thy view
833695 o abraham where are you going leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy nor is there anything to enjoy
833696 this is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them i e safa and marwa when she reached the marwa for the last time she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively she heard the voice again and said o whoever you may be you have made me hear your voice have you got something to help me
833697 may allah bestow mercy on ishmaels mother had she let the zam zam flow without trying to control it or had she not scooped from that water to fill her water skin zam zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth
833698 then she drank water and suckled her child the angel said to her dont be afraid of being neglected for this is the house of allah which will be built by this boy and his father and allah never neglects his people the house i e kaba at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock and when torrents came they flowed to its right and left she lived in that way till some people from the tribe of jurhum or a family from jurhum passed by her and her child as they i e the jurhum people were coming through the way of kada they landed in the lower part of mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it they said this bird must be flying around water though we know that there is no water in this valley they sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water and returned to inform them of the water so they all came towards the water
833699 ishmaels mother was sitting near the water they asked her do you allow us to stay with you
833700 ishmaels mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people
833701 what could you do in light of a general strike
833702 well lets give them back some territories and maybe theyll leave us alone
833703 you have to go along with me you dont want the left in power do you
833704 10 or so very wealthy families the wertheimers et al that control the economy of the state of israel
833705 thus according to this view any american jew like myself for instance who voluntarily actually picks himself up and leaves the us for israel has to be some sort of psychiatric case right
833706 the poorest and least educated israelis are also the most devoted to the occupation

833709 the go giver does everything i would wish a good book to do read it to the very end
833710 this terrific book wonderfully illuminates the principles of contribution abundance service and success
833711 most people dont have the guts to buy this book never mind the will to follow through and actually use it but you do and im certain that youll be glad you did
833712 people who are coaches will be the norm other people wont get promoted
833713 anyone who thinks the islamic revolution was carried out simply to reduce the price of watermelons doesnt understand anything
833714 for we know that it is by grace we are saved after all we can do
833715 it is finished your debt has been paid in full
833716 the mediator turned then to the debtor if i pay your debt will you accept me as your creditor
833717 oh yes yes cried the debtor you saved me from prison and show mercy to me
833718 then said the benefactor you will pay the debt to me and i will set the terms
833719 they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate
833720 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone
833721 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead
833722 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also
833723 according to the bible works are a result of salvation they spring out after a person is brought to saving faith they are expressions of gratitude for what god has done i do good works not because i think they are a requirement that i need to do in order to be accepted by god but freely and joyfully because god has already accepted me in jesus
833724 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect
833725 did jesus do everything for us to live with heavenly father or do we have to do something in order to live with heavenly father
833726 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven
833727 he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me
833728 good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life
833729 no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god
833730 except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
833731 except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
833732 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed
833733 if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me
833734 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love
833735 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commended you
833736 all blessings are conditional i know of none that are not
833737 your heavenly father has promised forgiveness upon total repentance and meeting all the requirements but that forgiveness is not granted merely for the asking there must be works many works and an all out total surrender with a great humility and a broken heart and contrite spirit
833738 if you dont repent youre going to hell and maybe today after all you just never know when christ is returning
833739 you must all becoming like jesus christ now today no more waiting
833740 the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth
833741 as it is written there is none righteous not not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one
833742 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all
833743 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
833744 the question is where in the bible does the thought of obedience to commandments aid us in salvation
833745 a monotheistic religion centered on the life and teachings of jesus of nazareth as presented in the new testament
833746 we believe in god the eternal father and in his son jesus christ and in the holy ghost
833747 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast
833748 for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted as righteousness
833749 for it is by grace that we are saved after all we can do
833750 one of the most fallacious doctrines originated by satan and propounded by man is that man is saved alone by the grace of god that belief in jesus christ alone is all that is needed for salvation
833751 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rages
833752 god is not the author of confusion but of peace
833753 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect
833754 by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy
833755 there may be times when we feel overwhelmed hurt or on the edge of discouragement as we are trying so hard to be perfect members of the church
833756 and see that all things are done in wisdom and order for it is not requisite that men or women should run faster than they have strength but it is expedient that they should be diligent
833757 for behold this life is the time for men to prepare to meet god yea behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors
833758 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
833759 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god
833760 he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not comeinto condemnation but is passed rom death unto life
833761 the word of god is living and active sharper than any double edged sword
833762 the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
833763 is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes
833764 something you had faith in turned out to be a load of garbage
833765 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin
833766 but now a righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe
833767 do you believe that all one must do is rely solely on what jesus has done and we will be saved
833768 for behold i god have suffered these things for all that they might not suffer if they would repent but if they would not repent they must suffer even as i
833769 and thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice and encircles them in the arms of safety while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption
833770 and if by grace then it is no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more of grace otherwise work is no more work romans 9 6
833771 i thought i can keep up with manny pacquiaos power but i didnt know that hes fucking fast

833773 if meralcos management can get away with bloody murder against its very shareholders what more when it comes to the general public and its customers who ultimately pay the high price of unjustifiably high electricity bills due to corporate mismanagement and shenanigans
833774 user labor is the work that people put in to create improve and maintain their existence in social web
833775 can externally hosted services as some suggest replace some of the services currently provided in house or is such out sourcing dangerous for institutions placing a reliance on unproven technologies and unsustainable business models

833796 it seems like it ran out somewhere over there by the tunnel or somewhere it kind of caught me off guard it was one of those deals where we pitted where our window opened for the fuel mileage we werent trying to push nothing kinda weird
833797 you kind of know whats going on but its really hard to keep track of
833798 we knew when we stayed out there when it rained that we were about three laps short of making it on one stop and everybody else was gonna make it on one stop so unless we had more rain or more caution laps we knew we were gonna be a little short thats just what we chose to do i thought it was gonna rain one more time we didnt think it was gonna rain out but i though there was gonna be another little delay and then we would have been able to make it
833799 its just not that kind of racing anymore its figuring out how much gas youve got in the tank and being in clean air its just really add comment
833800 life is like this hot dog this is our life its not the best anyone could have but it is our life and this relish here it represents love and she piled on the relish on top of the hot dog now some people eat their hot dogs without relish they live their whole lives without any love we on the other hand eat our hot dogs with a lot of relish and we have a lot of love in our lives remember this girls no matter what situation you find yourselves in as your grow up you will always have a choice you can live your life with a lot of love or a little love or no love you decide how much relish you want on your hot dog

833809 at first i wanted to stay in the premier league and i had the pen in my hand to sign
833810 then at the last minute they said that the chairman wasnt here and i had to wait so i said okay i would come back tomorrow
833811 then the gaffer called me up about rangers and spoke very well with me and i chose rangers it was very difficult to leave england but i think this was a good choice
833812 i know its a big club last year they won two trophies its a dream to come to rangers because they play in europe every year
833813 its the ambition of every player to play in the champions league or the uefa cup which is why i came here
833814 he contacted me and spoke very well after i signed for rangers he wished me good luck
833815 he is a very good gaffer and it was a good conversation
833816 when you come into a team you cant say im going to play every week

833836 in a run and a half we made up almost an entire pit stop on the field
833837 kasey kahne was really really good we were pretty close to him on speed we had a great race car and im very proud of that we had one good enough to win with if everything would have went our way but it didnt
833838 i dont really follow the points too closely just for the fact that you go out and race as hard as you can and you want to try to win every week and if you cant win do the best you can
833839 we have to get better were testing and were working hard to get better and were making gains
833840 were not by no stretch of the imagination where we need to be but on the flip side were better than we were two months ago
833841 i was just up underneath somebody and i think the no 78 of nemechek just got in the back there and we all kind of got jammed up
833842 i dont know if it was anybodys fault or not but it worked out good we were able to work on our car early and make it better and we just kept making it better all day
833843 to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me
833844 weve floundered around the second half of the year with being in and being out of the top 12 one week to the next
833845 weve been in several crashes and things that kevin normally avoids and this year we have wrecked four or five times add comment

833848 my life already is full to the max with work
833849 i desperately needed something better to manage my receivables i hacked something up for myself and to show my clients that this could be done online
833850 no longer do my clients have to look at my chicken scratchings
833851 one of the important aspects i teach my clients about e business is the value and importance of customer service and freshbooks team gets it
833852 i can call monday through friday and get someone on the other end
833853 i just knew there had to be a better way
833854 everyones like a family member here rather than a worker
833855 freshbooks youve got a customer for life and yet one more person to sing your praises to the masses
833856 we want to reshape the lives of our customers and change the world
833857 our crack blogware stored them for awhile and then popped them back out
833858 oh yeah i should warn you when we go in they are going to pat you down to see if you are carrying a knife or gun

833861 credit the text to cullen nawalkowsky john duda and myself members of the books coordinating committee at red emmas
833862 we are informed by anarchism but we never had any desire to be an anarchist bookstore
833863 we are also informed by feminism queer theory afrocentrism marxism dada and the avant garde literary modernism and dozens of other traditions
833864 we lacked the resources or credit to really establish relationships with major publishers or distributors we relied primarily on the kindness of ak press one of the best radical publishing projects in the biz whos helped many a radical bookstore get up and off the ground over the years
833865 we made journeys to some friends in philadelphia and massachussetts who had good lines on remainder titles and that helped sustain us for a long time as the coffeeshop side of the business developed we were able to establish more and more relationships with publishers and distributors attend trade shows etc
833866 we have casual customers who are just kind of walking around mount vernon and stopping in for a cup of coffee they gravitate towards the music titles popular fiction and classics
833867 academics and teachers come in looking for texts for class or for research projects we have regulars who keep up with the latest releases of noam chomsky amy goodman naomi klein bell hooks etc activists come in looking for books on consensus organizational models and historical texts on social change
833868 im hesitant to say we have a favorite type of customer but we get a good measure of glee when visitors from out of town come through and just start making a stack of books because they have never seen any of them before
833869 people come from new york and other way larger cities and tell us theyve never seen a selection like ours that makes us really happy
833870 we take pride in our philosophy section which has the best selection of continental philosophy in the city we have more foucault and zizek than you have ever seen in one place
833871 we try to always keep on hand biographies and histories of great movement organizers and groups ella baker che guevara gandhi web dubois and the pan african movement joe hill and the iww students for a democratic society and so on there is so much neglected knowledge even within the activist community were trying to fill those gaps
833872 we believe in the one holy catholic and apostolic church
833873 make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all
833874 however he has given each one of us a special gift according to the generosity of christ
833875 hold to the truth in love becoming more and more in every way like christ who is the head of his body the church

833895 our fervent pursuit of being right takes priority over right relationship she said the disarray of the table the fractured and ruptured united methodist relationships and carefully calculated formulas of theology make church members unable to hear and listen to the cries of a neighbor our own need deafens us to the needs of others she said

833915 thank you for contacting ann taylor regarding the dead cockroach your received with your online order
833916 i received my order from ann taylor however besides the items that i purchased there were two loose screws and one dead cockroach in the box the screws are a little strange but i didnt mind them the cockroach on the other hand is completely disgusting and probably some sort of health hazard but definitely disgusting all of my purchases are in plastic bags so i am ok with keeping them i like shopping at ann taylor i also like shopping at i would like to continue shopping from the online store but i should not be afraid of finding bugs in my packages i would appreciate it if you would consider crediting my credit card account a sum that you deem appropriate to compensate me for having a dead cockroach fall out from between by new jacket and my new pants thank you in advance
833917 as the fourth episode is broadcast on wednesday the show has been moved from thursday nights to wednesdays i am resigned to the producers intent to make the series
833918 clearly somebody was inspired more by christopher guests comic film
833919 one of the most hideous soul destroying genres ever hatched

833922 i watch part of the episode last night the person who sprayed grapefruit juice in her dogs face and received a well deserved bite and then put a rubberband over the dogs mouth and teeth should have been tossed out
833923 six year olds dont need that much but the recommendations are 2 servings daily of 1 2 ounces of a protein rich food and 3 4 servings of milk with a serving being 1 2 3 4 cup total of 1 1 2 3 cups
833924 one egg can be substituted for 1 ounce of meat one fourth cup of pasteurized egg or egg substitute would do the same and could go into the smoothie the mom envisions
833925 two tablespoons peanut butter can replace 1 ounce of meat fish poultry or 1 3 cup cooked beans black pinto kidney garbanzo for the milk she can use cheese or 2 1 2 tablespoons dry skim milk powder in place of 1 2 cup milk
833926 consuming vitamin c at the meal all those fruits also helps with absorption of iron but the child may well need more iron in the diet to absorb
833927 i am not sure about using the soy protein powder there is some discussion about soy and as long as the family isnt vegetarian there is no reason the mom couldnt use a casein protein powder but wouldnt want to use too much casein is from dairy milk and found in gnc and places like that one scoop provides 20 grams of protein or the same as in 3 ounces of meat so she wouldnt want to use much maybe only 1 4 or 1 2 scoop she should also look at ellyn satters books on introducing and providing new foods in a friendly way

833939 the board was convinced that my new ad campaign for arsenic and semen flavored lollipops for tots will be incredibly impactful and will generate heaps of sales
833940 tim franklin the editor of the sun said that something was impactful seeing several editors giving him the fisheye
833941 a related question is will rates rise relatively more than prices fall
833942 i dont think ill make much profit if i buy now vs 1 year from now
833943 everyone who is a first time buyer now thinks it only makes sense to own a home if prices are going to increase 10 a year and be guaranteed to never decline its a roof over your head not a mutual fund the chance that it might go up in value is a bonus not the primary reason you own a home
833944 who would want to live on top of a parking garage in this part of town

833949 my wife and i have slightly different approaches to stuff
833950 for her less is more for me less is more too unless i can think of some possible scenario where i could use it
833951 fast forward to last weekend were registering again except this time its for our first child wholl be crashing our double income no kids party
833952 we dont have the courage and mental stamina to walk into babies r us so my wife karen and her mom start poking around online they register they add stuff to the list they keep a few things off the list that they know some relatives have promised to buy for us
833953 i check in occasionally with them but i keep a safe distance
833954 dont we want one of those heavy duty jogging strollers so we can have a smooth ride on city streets
833955 in the end i feel that the one area that i can deftly handle is the technology associated with babydom these days
833956 it was while contemplating what types of technology i could bring to bear on this baby experience that it hit me my wife is gonna be home for three months
833957 i threw it out there to my wife and mom in law and they gently laughed at me or rather they laughed at the idea i like to think
833958 so i went online at babies r us and tried to add the wii to the registry and i couldnt do it was i doing it wrong i dont think so
833959 which brings me to the point of this whole blog post let parents register for a wii it is shortsighted on the part of the babies r us toys r us conglomerate to not allow our dearest friends and family the opportunity to offer us an escapist respite during the early months of raising an infant
833960 yea and i want to be the queen of sheba
833961 whos got that kind of cash they can throw away
833962 speak to me she was also the second half of the duo lyric with another former mcclurkin background songbird rhonda mcclemore

833975 by driving less and using more fuel efficient vehicles americans are showing us that the highways of tomorrow cannot be supported solely by the federal gas tax
833976 we must embrace more sustainable funding sources for highways and bridges through more sustainable and effective ways such as congestion pricing and private activity bonds
833977 keep huff as the permanent dh and sign texiera that is a must
833978 here is your change to show your desire for mark texeira to be a baltimore oriole
833979 rob last month i got a wells banana bread beer
833980 this beer is somewhat sweet but beery but nothing like those junk sweet liquors i wouldnt recommend it for daytime or with meals but when you want to sit back and drink a pint but are also in the mood for dessert
833981 i initially had no idea where things were headed however it hit me as soon as adamle came sprinting out to take cole s place at the broadcast table i told my friend sitting next to me that i thought adamle was the gm he looked at me as if i had just said that the orioles were going to win the world series this year
833982 if you dont buy the ppv events which most dont or watch ecw which again most dont you have no idea who this guy is
833983 a milestone in our nations efforts to remedy the ills of our past
833984 we must now continue our efforts to free african americans from the shackles of inferior education inadequate health care and lack of jobs
833985 acknowledges the fundamental injustice cruelty brutality and inhumanity of slavery and jim crow apologizes to african americans on behalf of the people of the united states for the wrongs committed against them and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and jim crow and expresses its commitment to rectify the lingering consequences of the misdeeds committed against african americans under slavery and jim crow and to stop the occurrence of human rights violations in the future
833986 a large step forward in reconciliation for the offenses of generations past
833987 as a fifty seven year old black man and a descendent of slaves i understand first hand the devastating imprint that slavery racism and segregation has left on the foundation of our country
833988 it pains me that the effects of such discrimination are still embedded in the fabric of our society seen in the disparities of education health care and employment opportunities
833989 in the past year people of all races religions and backgrounds came together to stand out against a series of racial incidents symbolized through the placement of nooses around the country despite all of the accomplishments of the african american community and of our society as a whole these actions of intolerance are unwelcome reminders that racial tension and discrimination are not the distant memories that we may think they are
833990 i vote for offering another ticket opportunity as reperations that to me would be an investment worth every penny
833991 dogs sing together instinctively as part of a pack their sense of community
833992 in swansea there are so many breeds with different characters and voices and all have a relationship like us with the place in which they live i felt it a fitting homage to swansea jack whose instinct was to be a hero
833993 one of the big issues is does the mayor have the stomach for expending a fair amount of political capital
833994 liz better give us some innings otherwise ill be asking a little bit too much of some people
833995 did what hes supposed to do thats the job of a long guy
833996 suggested the site be used for an urban park a transit center and a mix of retail residential and office space
833997 were disappointed the arguments we put forth were not heard
833998 oh the oriole way is what im trying to do and the starting pitchers need to get it going blah blah blah
833999 i think i could be very content with going 1950s style and having separate beds in the same room
834000 you meet infinitely more people because you are more social when single
834001 you dont get yelled at for having one or even six pints too many
834002 im not single now but dining alone is a pleasure i used to and still enjoy theres something so gutsy about going to a restaurant alone its a bit freeing
834003 its a good thing im on this leash or youd be an extinct species
834004 well so much for holding it in until i got home
834005 umm you did say we are going to the academy of natural science right so yeah about that
834006 but when i started getting used to the competition and the type of players that you play at this level i started playing better i adjusted to it and things have been going pretty good
834007 we can feed off this win but we have to remember that there are much tougher teams out there
834008 it feels good to win big but we have to keep working if we want to win the gold medal we worked really hard to get here and we cant afford to lose focus
834009 i had my mind set on maryland since i was a little boy as a young man i used to watch maryland play all of the time
834010 coach griffin hes a coach up there at maryland and he was my coach at woodlawn when i was younger so theres a lot of personal trust going on i feel really comfortable with this decision
834011 we have heard this before you are a burb girl and i am a city guy i get it
834012 no it would not be useful going back ten years ten years ago in the city would be silly 10 years ago the east side hadt boomed their were murders in the local movie houses and baltiore was experiecing its largerst population decline the 90s where tough on baltimore
834013 for years the small minded have told anyone who would listen that baltimore cant support the nba cant support the nhl cant afford a new arena and then get offended when the national media calls our city
834014 how to pay for a new arena put a casino in the basement the gambling
834015 i think when you lose games you have to do something to try to mix it up you cant stay status quo youve got to try to balance out your lineup a little bit better you have to do something different that youve been doing you get stagnant people get comfortable
834016 i made a nice play on a bunt play that was a positive i didnt walk anybody i threw seven pitches to the first guy i think and the next five or six hitters saw a total of maybe eight or nine pitches i hit bats i didnt get the ball down like i wanted to but it was good to get out there
834017 i think at this particular point and time you have to consider every possibility just from the standpoint of keeping the morale of your team from going bonkers
834018 you guys know all the numbers and all the situations look at the last x amount of games and how quickly weve been behind in the first or second inning not by one or two runs but by crooked numbers of runs and how this team has responded now you would have to be someone that would expect to be moses and part the red sea to think thats not going to take its toll on your team and i think theyre waiting and looking to see if we can do something i have a new respect for the term patience i really do because people look to see how youre going to react how are you going to handle it how are you going to deal with it just trying to keep an even keel approach on it the last thing i want to do is accept it and the last thing i want is the players to accept it i hope people are upset about it i wish somebody would light a fire under somebody and say hey enough is enough like in the movie the guy opens up the window and yells out were not going to take it anymore its hard it really is
834019 i think sometimes you have to do something that you feel will give you a little shot in the arm sometimes a shot in the arm will do wonders so you have to consider all the possibilities and yet also understand the ramifications of all the other things to be considered makeup service time roster spots all those other things my wife told me last night shes never seen me run out of a dugout so fast up those stairs to take burres out i guess i did because i didnt want to see that anymore its not that i didnt want to see it anymore i didnt want those guys out there to see it anymore and think im going to sit back on my hands and say its ok its not ok what i can do about it i dont know what id like to do about it is another story what we will do about it is stay tuned
834020 we want to play better we need to pitch better we have 60 games to play we want to win the majority of those games we have to get better starting pitching if we dont get better starting pitching its not going to be what were looking for im trying to be realistic about it and not say oh woe is me but weve gone through the down period long enough and i think weve been patient for a long time and given people ample opportunity to pull their socks up and to button up their chin strap and just give us a little sense of encouragement and let me see something that makes me feel like ok were going to get out of it and to be honest with you im still waiting and i dont know how much longer i can wait and i dont know how much longer andys going to wait im not trying to be threatening or anything like that i love all these guys theyre great but if it aint working weve got to try to do something to fix it and the solutions and the answers that we have might not be the best for right now but i dont think we have anything to lose by at least trying maybe something different im not saying thats going to happen tomorrow or next week but i think it definitely has to be considered i think thats fair i dont think anybody would argue about that
834021 if theres blame to be placed anywhere its on the guy putting them out there
834022 these guys are starting because its on my watch and im running them out there the blame doesnt go on ramon or the guy whos catching or the pitching coach or any of that and i think that sends the wrong message trust is a very difficult thing to obtain in life and in this game and i think you could do something to scar some people and you may not get them back and i dont want to do that its not ramons fault
834023 michelle mccool is so ridiculously thin that the wwe divas title belt didn t come close to being tight enough around her waist that means the title doesn t fit her literally or figuratively
834024 hmm weve got two main event caliber wrestlers appearing on a segment which will most likely produce some great lines and then theyre in a battle royal for a chance at the title maybe we should give the shot to one of them instead of the 7 ft tall monster who couldnt cut a promo to save his life and still isnt over with the fans
834025 khali is regarded as something of a national hero in india
834026 khali is portrayed as something of a national hero in india
834027 the cruiser title should totaly be brought back now that there are a couple of smaller guys i would like to see battle for it
834028 think before you make an off handed remark about something as serious as racism
834029 saying race is not a factor at all is na ve
834030 its that race is one of many factors that have to be dealt with
834031 he was very clear that the election was not about race
834032 one of the most powerful messages that republicans always try to pin on democrats that hes not one of us
834033 perhaps the lessons of that helped baracks team get him through the jeremiah wright
834034 is going to be how senator obama handles it and how the news media handles it
834035 twenty years ago most voters had grown up in a society that was still legally segregated but now to have a recollection of that you have to be over 55
834036 are basically beyond race theyre used to living in communities with a fair amount of diversity
834037 somebody may say they are anti obama on the grounds of experience or they may say that he doesnt share american values because he doesnt wear a flag pin on his lapel
834038 at one level those may be legitimate concerns but are they also a way to cover up racism for some people they may be for others not
834039 you could only be a racist if you dont love the messiah
834040 defeat according to officials of both campaign and independent analysts had less to do with race than with issues of corruption involving members of his family and his background as a washington insider
834041 so do you want one big gift or three little gifts
834042 do you want one big gift or three little gifts
834043 oh yeah that reminds me i meant to ask you do you want one big gift or three little gifts
834044 the environment in which we find ourselves from a political standpoint is scary good

834046 it appears that steny hoyer is about as bad at playing the expectations game as chris van hollen and chuck schumer are
834047 here within lies the inherent problem facing the democratic leadership campaign politics is on their mind first and foremost while legislating remains a distant second with gas prices skyrocketing to all time highs the american people would undoubtedly disagree with steny hoyers scary good outlook for the future right now they are just plain scared and the democrat led congress is doing nothing to ease the pain
834048 and everybody in the room said hoyer is just spinning this i thought the context in which we were running and the quality of candidates we had gave me reason to believe

834071 its rather sad to see you brown nosing those boors at language log i thought based upon your previous posts that you had a backbone
834072 the error of viewers with alarm is in assuming that there is enough magic in pedagogy to teach correct english to the plain people there is in fact too little even the fearsome abracadabra of teachers college columbia will never suffice for the purpose the plain people will always make their own language and the best that grammarians can do is to follow after it haltingly and often without much insight their lives would be more comfortable if they ceased to repine over it and instead gave it some hard study it is very amusing and not a little instructive

834074 there is no doubt in our eyes adams can carry the load in the acc he is an explosive thickly built runner with great initial burst and in line power ideal body structure and running style to develop into a high carry durable workhorse at the next level and wear down a defense by the 4th quarter maloof concurred with tucker s assessment calling adams a power back with 4 5 speed he can get the hard yardage he has great open field speed and a little open field wiggle which are the three things you need in division i football especially in the acc they re getting a great kid will md still pursue austin adams remains me of a lance ball type of back who can run between the tackles get tough yards portzel i think will be used more like bruce perry was in this offense i dont see austin shying away from any school because of other signees but you have to wonder how they plan to share the ball with the other two kids as well as scott and green who will be on the roster likely through the 2010 season i dont see austin playing rb at the next level hes just too small to hold up he could be a great wr or db and id love to have him i just doubt hed be best at rb certainly too small for an nfl rb the terps should go after austin harder than ever he is a reggie bush type of back one that can catch passes either out of the backfield or split wide you can run him between the tackles or toss it to him to get the corner and turn it upfield he can return kicks and break long runs both with his shiftiness and speed he can play with any other back at md usc had both bush and lendell white bush to play wherever and white to line up at tailback good coaches make room for a player like austin i think austin is thier top priority porzel has said already he will rs austin will probably be used in the slot and on plays that allow him to get into space and use his unbelievable skills to make plays adams will probably be your every down back with austin in the slot and porzel in on 3rd down and spelling adams a good deal either way all this talent on offense at the skill positions should attract a top qb next year when is the article on how great umd is recruiting this year coming out speaking of qbs i would love to see a list of the top rising qbs on the east coast assuming that they were starting as qbs in 2007 there should be a short list porzel should be a 59

834110 as long as democrats continue to defy 60 percent of the american people who want to drill for more oil to lower the cost of gasoline and send their vulnerable members home in august without passing an energy bill they wont come anywhere close to winning in the 75 seats they have been ranting about

834130 if speaker nancy pelosi is serious about taking action to stimulate the economy she should start by allowing a vote on increased american energy production
834131 to help ensure long term economic growth the time has long passed for speaker pelosi and her colleagues in the democratic leadership to end their opposition to effective energy and economic reforms that will make a real difference for consumers
834132 the president said in february when the first bill was passed and we did it in record time we worked together in a bipartisan way that he didnt want to do any of these other things
834133 he wanted to just do the rebates he wanted to see how they worked
834134 well i think they had a positive effect except they have been offset as has been said by our experts by the rising costs in other necessities for the american people so while they may have saved the second quarter from a technical definition of a recession the fact is that we are into a third quarter and we need to have another stimulus package
834135 to help ensure long term economic growth the time has long passed for speaker pelosi and her colleagues in the democratic leadership to end their opposition to effective energy and economic reforms that will make a real difference for consumers

834138 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
834139 the bush plan is a hoax it will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence it just gives millions more acres to the same companies that are sitting on nearly 68 million acres of public lands and coastal areas
834140 ive been in washington long enough to know a political stunt when i see one
834141 the good news is the american people wont be fooled if the president wants to lower gas prices he should stop hosting press conferences and start taking action
834142 for years my administration has been calling on congress to expand domestic oil production
834143 unfortunately democrats on capitol hill have rejected virtually every proposal and now americans are paying at the pump
834144 the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil resources is action from the u s congress
834145 now the ball is squarely in congress court democratic leaders can show that they have finally heard the frustrations of the american people by matching the action ive taken today repealing the congressional ban and passing legislation to facilitate responsible offshore exploration
834146 if the president wants to bring down prices in the next two weeks not the next two decades he should free our oil by releasing a small portion of the more than 700 million barrels of oil we have
834147 enacting this plan which would increase production of american energy improve energy efficiency and conservation and encourage investment in groundbreaking research in advanced alternative and renewable energy technologies will signal to the rest of the world that america will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to bring down fuel costs
834148 will do nothing to lower gas prices but will mean one more handout to those who are already enjoying billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies
834149 if the oil companies wanted more domestic drilling they could begin today they could begin on the 68 million acres of land that are already set aside leased and available
834150 in quieter moments officials on both sides acknowledge there is little they can do in the short term to restrain retail prices which makes it easy for each to accuse the other of posturing
834151 boy are the oil companies a bunch of whiners gramm was right thats their cost of doing business ken and theyre not hurting in the slightest you ignore thae fact that congress and the bush administration have given large breaks on the royalty fees that the oil companies should pay on their leases you ignore the fact that the oil comapnies have been regularly found to have defrauded the government on their royalty payments

834171 obamas people recognize that their whole challenge is to get the american people comfortable with the idea of him as commander in chief and the leader of the country
834172 if he gets a rousingly positive reception its going to make americans feel that perhaps he can help mend fences with our allies which is what they want to see happen
834173 it could come across as a real celebration of obama
834174 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
834175 us presidential candidate barack obama is right when he talks about 16 months

834198 two thirds of northern alaska is open to drilling so if theyre serious about increasing the domestic production of oil they should take a left at the arctic refuge and keep going west for about 150 miles
834199 that will put them in the national petroleum reserve alaska the best source for alaskan oil and an area that is already open for business
834200 our american energy tour will shine a spotlight on what the democratic majority cant seem to grasp we can bring down the price of gasoline
834201 america is rich with emerging energy technologies as well as a vast supply of natural resources that has been put off limits by the majority party
834202 today in colorado we will learn how scientists and engineers are making america less dependent on foreign sources of energy
834203 in alaska we will learn more about the 10 billion barrels of oil held hostage by the majority on the desolate coastal plane
834204 according to experts the national petroleum reserve alaska holds more oil than the arctic refuge with an estimated 10 6 billion barrels to 10 4 billion barrels
834205 we can get at the oil sooner too unlike the arctic refuge the npr a is approved for drilling right now and its closer to existing pipelines
834206 this wednesday the administration announced a major sale of leases there which just proves democrats point in addition millions of oil producing acres with completed environmental reviews are still available to be quickly explored
834207 it is time for speaker pelosi and house democratic leaders to stop defying the will of the house and ignoring the calls of the american people
834208 well it is the reason it is contained is because we have the extra troops there that is self evident
834209 come on people are fungible you can have them here or there we have announced the judgment it is clear you understand it everyone in the room understands that we needed additional the commander decided hed like to retain in country an additional plus or minus 20 000 people and that is what we are doing
834210 that means the earths spin has slowed by about 33 seconds since then relative to the atomic clocks
834211 i would remind my republican colleagues that the route of continued obstruction is not without cost
834212 most importantly it comes at a cost to the american people who are facing medicare cuts increasing home foreclosure and ever higher gas prices because republicans refused to work with us last work period
834213 but continued obstruction comes at a cost to our republican colleagues themselves as well the american people see with clear eyes that as our countrys economic crisis continues to grow worse republicans have only dragged their heels there is good reason why polls show that americans favor democratic control of congress by the widest margin in the history of polling
834214 this bill contains provisions that should be agreeable to both sides of the aisle it tackles both sides of the energy issue by increasing supply and curbing demand we should do both
834215 there are many important issues facing the congress but few are more important than addressing the issue of energy its time to act and this balanced approach is a good start
834216 this is not a list of democratic priorities or pet issues
834217 it is not a platform for the 2008 campaign these are the critical priorities of the american people
834218 the next several weeks could be easy or they could be difficult if republicans are willing we could pass this legislation swiftly and with overwhelming support from both democrats and republicans
834219 but if past is prologue republicans are likely to drag their heels the republican leadership and the vast majority of republican senators may continue to stand behind a small handful of their republican colleagues who for reasons that are hard to understand would rather we accomplish nothing at all
834220 i understand the frustration that republicans feel as the minority party with the future looking no brighter for their party than the present
834221 that turning point can begin right now if republicans will allow us to move forward to debate legislation to lower gas prices and invest in clean renewable alternative fuels
834222 the goal of finding more energy at home rather than relying on the middle east is not a fantasy
834223 america is already the number three oil producer in the world and a number of states have indicated that they would like to open up the area off their coasts to even more oil exploration but theyre prohibited by a federal ban
834224 we should also lift the ban on oil shale development which the new democrat congress enacted last year
834225 our western states are sitting on a sea of oil three times as large as the oil reserves in saudi arabia yet at the insistence of the democrat majority we arent allowed to touch it
834226 instead of working with us on legislation to lower gas prices republicans propose that we lease more land to the oil companies
834227 democrats are open to considering any reasonable solution that will lower gas prices but lets remember that the oil industry already leases 68 million acres in america that they are not even using
834228 the oil industry already leases 68 million acres in america that they are not even using
834229 i dont have intention to fight on this category and im only doing this because they ufc asked me and i think i can do it

834238 i think the biggest tell all sign is when the couple stops doing things that are exclusively
834239 is to take serious steps to resolve the current impasse it is widely thought that the new president will have to move swiftly and creatively in the honeymoon period
834240 the next president will be called upon to focus early and intensely on the problems of the economy and the associated problems of energy and perhaps health care
834241 whether there would be space in the legislative agenda early on for an all out assault on the immigration problems strikes me as a dicey proposition at best

834249 democrats are for greater domestic production democrats are not against drilling
834250 just to give you an idea of what that means
834251 eighty eight million acres is maine new hampshire vermont massachusetts connecticut rhode island new york new jersey delaware and most of maryland is now available
834252 democrats are not against drilling what we are for is urging and making sure the oil companies who are getting the highest price for the product in history dont need any additional tax incentives to do so ought to be spending their money on exploring and bringing more product to market
834253 to do something important we all know requires dealing with the problem of supply and demand
834254 additional domestic supply needs to be part of the package
834255 the fact of the matter is what we need to do is produce more product in this country explore extract refine and get to market and bring prices down
834256 were for that but we also need to make sure that we conserve and look at alternatives the last 25 years republicans have not been interested in doing that
834257 what we are for is urging and making sure the oil companies who are getting the highest price for the product in history dont need any additional tax incentives to do so ought to be spending their money on exploring and bringing more product to market
834258 his solution is lets get more oil steny hoyer democrat
834259 just as there is no reason for the corporations to pump oil at a loss there is no reason for the american people to to give up a valuable asset without an appropriate level of benefit in return
834260 because thats what youre supposed to do its what everyone does
834261 greenpeace co founder patrick moore has decided that the risks of nuclear energy are lower than the risks of continuing to use carbon energy
834262 part of the thinking surely was that the press would peg them as dedicated environmentalists who have turned into pro nuke cheerleaders rather than as paid spokespeople
834263 we just find it maddening that hill amp knowlton which has an 8 million account with the nuclear industry should have such an easy time working the press

834273 you are very different from a woman who is not circumcised
834274 its a road that if you start going down that youre going to pretty much open yourself up to everybody who is unhappy with any particular custom however abhorrent we might find it
834275 it should have been presumed that their lives or freedom would be threatened in the future
834276 deploying a small portion of the resources in the spr would provide much needed assistance to american consumers facing record prices and help our economy during a serious period of instability
834277 i strongly urge you to use every available tool including deployment of the spr to provide timely relief for american consumers and businesses
834278 the fact is the american people expect and deserve far more than what speaker pelosi is proposing
834279 with her call for president bush to release supplies from the strategic petroleum reserve the speaker is admitting yet again that increasing the supply of oil will help reduce the price of gasoline
834280 i agree that more supply is necessary and so do my house republican colleagues who have been arguing for decades in favor of more american energy production
834281 the rapid decision to release crude oil from government controlled stocks in the united states and other oecd countries helped calm the global oil market and prices began to moderate when the 1991 spr drawdown was announced in conjunction with operation desert storm the price of oil immediately dropped 8 per barrel
834282 the results were immediate in spite of the fact that oil prices had not yet moved into the market demonstrating the psychological impacts on the market when the u s signals its intention to act by the end of the year actual oil prices had dropped from 30 94 to 20 38 per barrel a 34 decrease
834283 our strategic reserve is sufficiently large enough to guard against any major supply disruption over the next few months
834284 while its not likely that a majority of the races moved from solid to likely republican will become competitive by november the poor national climate for the gop and the dcccs unprecedented financial edge makes even very difficult districts for democrats worth keeping tabs on
834285 the cook political report currently sees the presidential contest as a toss up mccain currently has a 240 to 219 electoral vote edge with 79 electoral votes in the toss up column 270 are needed to win
834286 we will not accept any memorandum of understanding if it does not give a specific date for a complete withdrawal of foreign troops
834287 the u s government and the government of iraq are in agreement that we the u s government we want to withdraw we will withdraw
834288 president bush refuses to listen to congress or the american people but he cannot support iraqi political reconciliation and security and ignore iraqi prime minister malikis call for a timetable for the withdrawal
834289 lets take off the training wheels and let iraq handle their own affairs we have spent enough of our blood and treasure in iraq
834290 when democrats called for a timeline for the withdrawal of american troops from iraq they were attacked by president bush
834291 when prime minister maliki suggested a timeline for withdrawal the white house said he was reflecting a shared goal apparently in the bush white house the messenger matters more than message
834292 the iraqis have made it very clear including the meetings i had with the president and foreign minister of iraq that its based on conditions on ground
834293 thats what ive always said ive always said we will come home with honor and with victory and not through a set timetable
834294 look hes a politician he is a leader of a country thats finally coming together
834295 the fact is that we and the iraqis will deal in what is in the national security interests of both countries
834296 but the fragile the victory that weve achieved so far is fragile and has to be dictated by events and the situation on the ground
834297 the u s government and the government of iraq are in agreement that we the u s government we want to withdraw we will withdraw
834298 iraq is too violent we cannot withdraw we must surge
834299 the surge was a success benchmarks have been met we cannot withdraw now
834300 what was wrong with my last post what did i say that needed to be censored
834301 i have made it very clear to all parties that the first option ought to be to solve this problem diplomatically
834302 and the best way to solve it diplomatically is for the united states to work with other nations to send a focused message and that is that you will be isolated and you will have economic hardship if you continue trying to enrich
834303 thereby negating the need for the iranian regime to enrich at all
834304 saying to the world that 40 percent of oil is now held hostage by a single country
834305 in recent summits g8 countries have made pledges to help developing nations address challenges from health care to education to corruption now we need to show the world that the g8 can be accountable for its promises and deliver results
834306 in 2005 g8 leaders promised to double development assistance to africa by 2010
834307 americas on track to meet our commitments and in japan ill urge other leaders to fulfill their commitments as well
834308 the temptation is to kind of say well maybe this isnt really a war
834309 you know thats not the way i feel about it this is an ongoing constant struggle to defend our own security at the same time help people realize the blessings of liberty ill of course talk about afghanistan and iraq and ask the g8 to continue to help
834310 were constantly reassessing and seeing whether or not you know we can change tactics in order to achieve our objective
834311 it has been a tough month in afghanistan but its also been a tough month for the taliban
834312 you know one reason why there have been more deaths is because our troops are taking the fight to a tough enemy an enemy who doesnt like our presence there because they dont like the idea of american denying safe haven america is pressing an ideology thats opposite of theirs and so of course theres going to be resistance
834313 just last month they blocked bills to combat global warming halt the mortgage meltdown and bring down fuel prices
834314 last week republican senators blocked a bill protecting the ability of many medicare beneficiaries to see the doctor of their choice the bill would have cancelled a 10 6 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors
834315 there will be a lot of talk about patriotism over this fourth of july weekend and many senators will rightfully praise our military
834316 but true patriotism means honoring the men and women in uniform who defend our freedoms not just with words and flag lapel pins but with actions befitting their great sacrifices
834317 more than 230 years ago john adams one of the architects of americas independence wrote a letter describing the human cost of establishing our new nation a nation unlike any the world had ever seen a nation dedicated to freedom
834318 the letter was sent to his wife abigail two lines near the end of that letter speak directly to us
834319 he wrote posterity you will never know how much it cost the present generation to preserve your freedom
834320 i hope he added you will make good use of it
834321 on this fourth of july weekend as we celebrate our nations independence we can be proud that the generations of americans who followed john adams have preserved and expanded our heritage of freedom
834322 today women and african americans can not only vote for president they can run for president that is progress that would have astonished john and maybe even abigail adams
834323 but there is another change in america that would trouble our founders greatly if they could see it that is the political gridlock today in washington
834324 with gasoline at 4 a gallon and rising an energy crisis a global warming crisis our economy in trouble our military stretched thin and more americans every week losing their jobs their homes their pensions and their health care america must change course
834325 but in the senate the senate republican leadership is determined to stop efforts to bring change to washington
834326 just last month they blocked bills to combat global warming halt the mortgage meltdown and bring down fuel prices
834327 that cut which took effect on july 1st could force many doctors to stop seeing new medicare patients
834328 but its not just the seniors who will suffer military families are also at risk because of this republican filibuster
834329 payments under tricare the health care plan for active duty and retired military members and their families are tied directly to medicare payment rates
834330 now in my state of illinois nearly 156 000 tricare patients could be hurt by the medicare cuts all told 8 9 million veterans and military personnel nationwide face reduced medical services because of these cuts
834331 and while medicare and tricare payments to doctors are being cut the bush administration is giving insurance companies that offer private medicare advantage plans a 3 6 percent raise
834332 these private medicare advantage plans created in 2003 when the republicans controlled congress cost taxpayers an average of 13 percent more than regular medicare
834333 according to the non partisan congressional budget office private insurers will reap 150 billion in overpayments over the next decade money we could better use to improve medicare and cover some of the 47 million americans who are uninsured
834334 there will be a lot of talk about patriotism over this fourth of july weekend and many senators will rightfully praise our military
834335 house democrats and republicans have already come together with a strong bipartisan vote to block these cuts
834336 a city thats too gritty for the new york set
834337 when i talk about real fighter this is the kind of guy im talking about
834338 this guy sat down in a meeting with us literally two months ago and said youre not fighting me enough i want to fight more and he wants to keep proving himself hes one of these guys that said my window is this big and i want to get everything in before this window closes
834339 i dont have any health problems except my obesity and i will treat it god willing
834340 i will go to the usa and stay nearly three weeks to lose weight and have some rest and relaxation away from meetings and work
834341 how is your health mr president how are you feeling
834342 will be an opportunity to lay the groundwork for the visit that president bush will make to south korea which is now scheduled for august 5th and 6th that is just prior to the president going to beijing for the olympics
834343 the recent flatness of the u s homicide rate obscures the large increases in firearm death among males ages 25 44 especially black males
834344 the increases in firearm homicide we measured were almost twice as high among blacks as among whites and they were mostly concentrated in central metropolitan and fringe metropolitan areas
834345 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
834346 so many adults want their kids to feel good so they send them places or buy them things
834347 they prop them up with value judgments like youre such a good boy or youre such a pretty girl i realized very early on what kids really want is whats most valuable to you and thats your time
834348 it has long been known that vitamin a supplementation can reduce mortality in children over 6 months of age our study showed that vitamin a given at birth can also improve infant survival within the first 6 months of life
834349 we are excited by the results of this study that build on two previous studies in south asia confirming this low cost intervention can significantly contribute to reducing mortality in the first 6 months of life
834350 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
834351 its always fun to see michael really dig down and just focus under the pressure of events like this
834352 i think thats his best attribute its always fun to see that
834353 all the time but i just think it goes with the territory
834354 i think that senator clinton got the benefit of being a woman because women are wildly enthusiastic about her candidacy
834355 ill be very honest with you i had the luxury as chair of the convention of not having to be involved in the presidential primary my politics are about winning the house for the democrats
834356 is there sexism probably so is it responsible for the defeat i really wouldnt have the scientific knowledge all of the information to know that but i do think that being a woman has a positive upside in the campaign probably offset by more sexism i dont know
834357 of course there is sexism we all know that but its a given its a given and i think with the next generation it will be less
834358 i think that on the positive side senator clinton has advanced the cause of women in government and her candidacy has been a very very positive tonic for the country and had a very wholesome effect on the political process i really dont know i havent analyzed the rest
834359 and im a victim of sexism myself all the time but i just think it goes with the territory i dont sit around to say but for that
834360 her candidacy was a bright bright moment for us and she may run again
834361 for me that is going to have to wait until after november because i have 30 incumbents to re elect 30 vacant republican seats to try to win half or two thirds of and a number of republicans that we are challenging
834362 i dont want to make a decision without knowing what the facts are
834363 but i myself find that i get a tremendous upside because being a woman and i dont spend a lot of time worrying about sexist remarks that people make important for our country though is to know our country it might be valuable for those who study the american culture and politics
834364 and saying she would stop the campaign if hillary didnt drop out
834365 pelosi said she is already warning her house democratic colleagues to be prepared for a new reality next year if obama becomes president
834366 in an election that was very much about change it was a winning combination
834367 a big part of the gore success in 92 was that it had such a large element of surprise
834368 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
834369 if you havent figured it out by now working in the media is a pretty nice gig
834370 barring outright plagiarism or committing a crime you dont have to be accountable if you dont want to
834371 like politicians the athletes arent really interested that the reader gets to see a true picture of them just their spin on the truth
834372 in many ways it feels like lets say last july or august in iowa for us
834373 you look at these voters who are going to decide the election in these battleground states and they know very little about him
834374 would have a rare opportunity to define a new democratic party
834375 use his campaign as a platform for designing a new political cycle and achieve a mandate for starting it
834376 the people in the middle in some cases were only talking about six to ten percent of the people in a state they will decide the election
834377 some of these voters just havent been consuming the political news so we think we have some very very important foundational work to do
834378 even more important for a candidate like barack obama who people dont have a decades long relationship with theyre still thirsting for information they may need reassurance
834379 for most of my life my decisions have been made based on morals and family values and that whole belief system that ive had instilled in me since birth
834380 and now all of a sudden our country is turned upside down by all these economic issues that i havent encountered in my lifetime
834381 i just know vote for change i dont know what change
834382 i know there has been a lot of media coverage but im still waiting for the meat of it
834383 until i see what he wants to change and how hes going to change it i am totally undecided
834384 has to show me that hes got the intelligence and the people around him to make a difference globally
834385 figured out that they want change do they want the obama change or do they want the mccain change
834386 shes considering obama but wants more information about what hell do to improve the living standard of families earning less than 100 000 a year
834387 the candidate endorsed subsidies for private entrepreneurs to build low income units but while he garnered support from developers many projects in his former district have fallen into disrepair
834388 well look you cant please all groups some people offend others and
834389 in many ways it feels like lets say last july or august in iowa for us
834390 you look at these voters who are going to decide the election in these battleground states and they know very little about him
834391 obama unlike most presidential candidates has personally written two books both books are interesting easy to read and very informative about obamas character how it was formed his beliefs values and political principles and policies but most people are just too intellectually lazy to read them and that in a nutshell is why we get morons like bush
834392 for one thing the reagan era was winding down as a prosperous one that had built up whereas the bush era that mccain has played a part in is winding down as one of declines and growing losses as of yesterday for example the stock market has fallen enough to be considered well into bear territory combined with the real estate melt down and the ongoing credit crunch its just bad news everywhere
834393 theres plenty of meat on the bones these people just arent trying very hard to find out what it is if they listened to a single speech of his they would understand
834394 for those that live in illinois can you please give me examples of why obama is so great he hasnt done anything for this state besides using it for a political stepping stone for himself
834395 you have no right to know just trust me cuz im the guy with the funny name and hope and change
834396 janell mader 32 has come unmoored from her republican party and is up for grabs this year our country is turned upside down by all these economic issues that i havent encountered in my lifetime shes considering obama but wants more information about what hell do to improve the living standard of families earning less than 100 000 a year
834397 we have always seen the united states as impenetrable from the outside like a fortress but now we have found a way inside
834398 we were able to arrest those responsible put them on trial they are currently in u s prisons incapacitated
834399 terrorism as a club to make the american people afraid
834400 because the world had not seen before victors behave in ways that advanced a set of universal principles
834401 thats the only card they really have to play the anxiety of what the changes will mean
834402 and they are going to prey on those and obama is going to stress the positive and whoever wins that argument is going to win the election
834403 has to be acceptable as a potential commander in chief in order to win the election and hes not there yet
834404 one of the few areas where the public still trusts the republicans more than the democrats
834405 the democrats have yet to get the monkey off their back about being weak
834406 if the debate is about national security john mccain is winning almost by definition
834407 the obama campaign also showcased his meeting with foreign policy advisers including several from the clinton administration and hillary clintons campaign
834408 the u s could adequately defend itself against terrorism without violating the constitution
834409 obama wants to give bin laden all the rights of an american citizen in our court of law and just put him in prison instead putting a bullet between his eyes
834410 we will fight them abroad so you wont have to fight them here in your back yard
834411 how could any ethical person write about the future of a company a person they know little about or that persons health which they know little about this is a short basher induced article in my opinion
834412 i made a commitment to be a tar heel 22 years ago to hall of fame coach willie scroggs and now i have a chance to give back to the university alumni and carolina lacrosse family that had an extraordinary impact on my life
834413 my family is thrilled for the new challenge that lies ahead and we cant wait to hit the ground running in chapel hill
834414 im happy to welcome joe breschi as our lacrosse coach at carolina
834415 joe has done an outstanding job of building a fine program at ohio state im thrilled that he has decided to accept our offer joe had a tremendous playing career in chapel hill and it will be great to have him back as part of our athletic family
834416 we are proud to welcome the university of massachusetts and penn state to the caa in mens lacrosse
834417 both schools have excellent programs along with outstanding coaches and players their addition will keep caa mens lacrosse among the top division i conferences in the nation
834418 its an honor and it certainly means a lot to know that my family and i have this type of support from the school and particularly athletic director dr charles brown and school president dr freeman hrabowski
834419 it feels great to know that im going to be here and continue to work with the kids that we have we have great kids they mean a lot to me theyre a part of my extended family and just knowing that im going to be here for the next six years is really a dream come true
834420 i really wanted to have coach zim for all four of my years
834421 i think he gives everyone a fair chance theres really no politics with coach zim whoever plays well is going to play him being like that makes everything more competitive and thats why i think some of the kids on the team are as good as they are
834422 coach zim with the offense that he runs gives us the freedom to utilize our natural skills
834423 with a new coach im not sure how we would have been able to react to new plays and new schemes it definitely would have been difficult to adjust to an entirely new playing style
834424 we are looking forward to the excitement that mens lacrosse will bring to the big east conference
834425 we have schools with established and successful programs which want to come together and compete under the big east brand
834426 parma automatically becomes one of the big players of the opera world out there
834427 if he gets cleared by the national clearinghouse i think its a 9 out of 10 that he will go to maryland said branch
834428 if lataye pronounced latay and gus had played for maryland together they would have won a national championship branch said
834429 three people and three is a trend neighbors and friends have mentioned to me in the past few days they theyve seen more snakes this year not just the garden variety garter snakes but big 5 feet or more and thick phobia inducing snakes a week or so ago there were two big ones in the trees just over the fence at meadowbrook pool apparently they were attracting quite a crowd another friend has seen two in the past week at druid hill park they seem to be popping up in more populated areas anyway i thought it might be an interesting story if indeed there are more for some reason this year and if we should fear for our pets and children as my irrational neighbor tends to believe
834430 people dont kill snakes the way they used to which is good
834431 the females make a scent and the males often follow them
834432 if people see a snake its a good sign a lot of reptiles is a sign of a clean environment
834433 nature will take care of the eggs if you see a turtle on the road and you can stop safely move it off the road in the direction it was moving
834434 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
834435 the most important thing that mccain can do in this campaign is reoccupy that change and reform territory
834436 but i think the american people didnt get to know me yesterday they know me
834437 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
834438 while senator clinton has made clear throughout this process that she will do whatever she can to elect a democrat to the white house she is not seeking the vice presidency and no one speaks for her but her
834439 i intend to do nothing further this is not an advocacy campaign for me i need to get my life back meaning i have a family
834440 i did what i could for my good friend sen clinton and i launched this and spent the last few days talking about it but thats it
834441 thats it in terms of me no more hillary thats over and no more petition other than what i have done and i am going to get my life back with a 10 year old and a three year old and by the way i have two older and five grandchildren
834442 ive been lumped together with people who have said sen obama you have to put her on the ticket i chose my words very carefully my letter and anyone who wants to endorse the letter is advice
834443 you make the final decision whatever decision it is that you make we will support
834444 thats a big difference he is free to reject my advice a lot of people reject my advice join the crowd
834445 i told her that i was going to do it but i was going to do it on my own independent of her or anyone in the campaign she simply joshed me that in the almost 40 years that weve known each other ive never done what she has asked me to do anyway so she was not gong to try to persuade me one way or the other
834446 so the answer is i informed her i was doing something on my own and shes allowed me to do it
834447 i believe he is the strongest candidate for the asian american and pacific islander community and he understands that its time for aapi issues immigration education and small business policy for example to be discussed on the national stage
834448 have done exactly what i had hoped they would do
834449 i think its clear whether you are a voter who voted for sen obama or sen clinton that you want change in america
834450 you dont want four more years of president bushs policies
834451 time for the democratic party to unite behind barack obama
834452 now that the votes have been cast and the primary season has come to its close i am pleased to play a part in ratifying the decision of the voters in my district and across the country
834453 i dont know what hes going to do and im not going to comment until he makes his decision
834454 its one thing to opt out of the public system if youre going to get a gazillion 28 500 contributions the maximum individual donation to the party under current law
834455 its a different thing if your small donor base is almost three million people and they want to take advantage of that
834456 it is wrong and unfair to criticize senator obama should he do this i think it is great to have people who are giving small donations that is exactly what we need in this country
834457 i assume that we will we havent had that discussion
834458 when the nominee comes in basically they set the policy for the democratic national committee were going to abide by whatever senator obama wants us to do
834459 what senator obama has said and which i agree with is if you dont take money from special interests then the public is not subjected to the appearance of impropriety and thats why its important not to take money from lobbyists and special interests because it makes sure that the impression is that youre not doing things later on that are influenced by the fact that you took money from a particular special interest
834460 its not something in the grand scheme of things in terms of what were trying to accomplish that means anything but its exciting it makes it fun makes it a little interesting
834461 to have lacrosse among the top plays in general is a testament to the growth of the sport
834462 sportscenter has had full coverage on both of our games its great for the growth of the sport and im happy that the sport has gone this far
834463 i remember the night when i committed to hopkins it was literally dial one number or dial the other
834464 it was that close and i cant thank myself enough for making the right decision
834465 what tipped the scales was coach petros dave pietramalas loyalty to me and to my family and to the faith that he showed in me throughout the recruiting process no coach ever did that and i couldnt pass up an opportunity to play for a guy like him
834466 the face off position is all about knowing how to work how to work the stick how to work the ref how to work the whistle those guys are the best at it
834467 i dont really want to run away from baltimore too quickly
834468 i just realized in the past six months that i really do love baltimore and i dont think it was like that my whole time here i want to stay for a little bit and not run out of here
834469 with him youve just got to try to get into his hands but hes so good that he can free his hands up out of nowhere
834470 its more important to protect the scheme of our defense but i think when you dont need to slide its better to be tighter on him
834471 i think a lot of people have identified mine and michaels match ups as one of the more important ones of the day
834472 anyone who loves sausage or the law shouldnt watch either as they get made
834473 i was a little hesitant but once coach and i talked about it and i started watching film ive felt confident over the last couple of games that we could be slower going to me
834474 they kind of left me on an island but we do that every day in practice im used to that
834475 at times it was tough because i felt like we couldnt use our usual defensive slide packages because i wasnt meant to really leave him alone very much
834476 so we were a little tentative in the beginning going through a defense that we dont usually use consistently we usually use our crease sliding as our go to as most teams do and a lot of times we didnt do that because he would be inside but i think it was a great game plan and after it was 2 1 in the first quarter we thought it was the right game plan i think we knew right then that we had a good shot at this thing
834477 i have a lot more energy said megan mccolgan the other day
834478 ive been doing really good im happy with where i am right now
834479 all men are frauds the only difference between them is that some admit it i myself deny it
834480 if this were a secretary of state or national security adviser or policy type who lost policy battles when the president decided otherwise i think that would be understandable
834481 my view of my job as press secretary was nobody gives a damn what the press secretary thinks
834482 at this point its revealing but its not going to change the bush administrations legacy
834483 americans get to see and are sometimes shocked at how little currency is placed in the truth because of politics
834484 how you like me now blazers fans enjoy the offseason
834485 claim him flaws and all as one of our own
834486 isnt the best and cheapest form of treatment preventative care is it costlier to fix a burst pipe flooding a home or give it proper maintenance over a long term to keep it from breaking down
834487 we wish shane the best of luck in the future and will assist him in his transition this spring
834488 overly burdensome and prescriptive it would force fha and taxpayers to take on excessive risk and jeopardize fhas financial solvency
834489 but after i packed up my computer i found a bar and midway through my second drink it suddenly didnt bother me that much
834490 few things in my life have ever seemed quite so unfair
834491 you said that negotiating with iran is pointless and then you went further you said that it was appeasement were you referring to senator barack obama
834492 you know my policies havent changed but evidently the political calendar has people need to read the speech you didnt get it exactly right either what i said was is that we need to take the words of people seriously and when you know a leader of iran says that they want to destroy israel youve got to take those words seriously and if you dont take them seriously then it harkens back to a day when we didnt take other words seriously it was fitting that i talked about not taking the words of adolph hitler seriously on the floor of the knesset but i also talked about the need to defend israel the need to not negotiate with the likes of al qaeda hezbollah and hamas and the need to make sure iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon
834493 repeatedly youve talked about iran and that you dont want to see iran develop a nuclear weapon how far away do you think iran is from developing a nuclear capability
834494 you know richard i dont want to speculate and theres a lot of speculation but one thing is for certain we need to prevent them from learning how to enrich uranium and i have made it clear to the iranians that there is a seat at the table for them if they would verifiably suspend their enrichment and if not well continue to rally the world to isolate them
834495 we should mention we didnt just wake up on a monday morning and say lets call this a civil war
834496 if you go by the government number the figure that came out today stops just short of the official declaration of a recession
834497 its going to be one or two votes either way
834498 this is the first tax increase i havent supported in six years including many many bills that passes in the house
834499 i just think this is the wrong time to be doing another tax increase
834500 its not unreasonable to ask those patriotic citizens to pay an extra percentage
834501 i dont want to undermine the progress weve made in the special session
834502 then there was the way josh portis was used either the florida transfer still has no grasp of the offense or friedgen and franklin didnt want to show much to any potential spies infiltrating the red and white game
834503 but theres still al lot to do in practice to get better
834504 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is the philosophy of sniveling brats
834505 the obama campaign is campaigning hard to win as many votes as possible in puerto rico despite the early lead gained by the clintons we view each vote cast in the puerto rico primary as being as important as the votes in any other primary or caucus
834506 dont question us and dont think primitive little people we know whats best for you
834507 this is a mistake hayes is one of our best players
834508 you have to be able to shoot to be a shooting guard
834509 ah don your blurb about tucker proves in my opinion that you dont know what youre talking about when it comes to maryland basketball for those of us keeping track at home tucker averaged 15 8 minutes per game 4 1 pts per game 2 3 rebounds per game and 1 4 assists per game with a 1 76 assist turnover ratio
834510 one wild card that could influence the south carolina outcome on saturday forecasts call for bad weather statewide and especially in the
834511 in iowa he said he was above politics and wasn t going to publish negative romney ads while he released them to the press proving he is either dirty or disorganized and unable to keep his campaign on message
834512 what you have to ask yourself is who you believe would be the better nominee to go toe to toe against john mccain
834513 its more or less pick em if you were a handicapper
834514 youd say you cant make the case for either one
834515 thats much closer than youd expect for a republican candidate given all the democratic advantages
834516 its not crazy its not an absurd case its a debatable question
834517 there are clearly some democrats in some key states who arent going to vote for obama older voters blue collar voters the old reagan democrats
834518 reminds people who werent paying attention that he has trouble with a key democratic voter constituency
834519 have worked him over i suspect thered be relatively little difference
834520 there will be some people who will not vote for him because of race
834521 but most of the democrats will come into the fold because of things like the war and the economy
834522 barack obama has to understand that if he is to have any chance of overcoming the racial factor he has to develop a middle class message and he has yet to find that
834523 foolish and dangerous threat that was muted in domestic media coverage
834524 while it is reasonable to warn iran of the consequences of it continuing to develop nuclear weapons and what those real consequences bring to its security it is probably not prudent in todays world to threaten to obliterate any other country and in many cases civilians resident in such a country
834525 it demonstrates the same doltish ignorance that has distinguished bushs foreign relations
834526 a lot of these lobbyists whether you like it or not represent real americans they actually do they represent nurses they represent social workers yes they represent corporations that employ a lot of people
834527 ive been waiting for this this gives us a real sense of reality with my being here
834528 how many people in this room have a washington lobbyist working for you
834529 you are not represented by washington lobbyists we need to cut these people off
834530 theres a certain style to the campaign and it shows what we might expect in a clinton presidency a lot of viewpoints and a messiness
834531 the bottom line is that she went in with a set of assumptions that proved to be false
834532 you got the sense that her attitude was im the nominee so what else are you going to do said gordon fischer a former iowa democratic party chairman
834533 every time i saw him on tv i thought he was losing us voters
834534 i remember landing under sniper fire there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base
834535 obama sent a request on state senate letterhead urging illinois officials to provide a 50 000 tourism promotion grant to another blackwell company killerspin

834549 and if you decide to do 20million operations when you could very easily instead do 1million eventually were going to have some problems
834550 very happy because we start something that it is an important process of preservation of our forest
834551 we believe that our tourism industry should be different from bali we cannot compete and we dont want to compete from other places
834552 we will explore the difference and our capability in terms of what we have not only preserving for the foreign eyes but also for our country for future generation
834553 yeah well sites will start banning any email addressed to mailinator and then it will be worthless
834554 yeah well sites will start banning any email from mailinator and then it will be worthless
834555 this sounds pretty insecure what if i want to send important emails with sensitive super secret information in them to mailinator then you are a stupid head that isnt what this is for so mailinator solves the spam problem heck no if it solved the spam problem it would probably be called ibminator or microsoftinator or something even catchier cuz we would have sold it and wed be zillionaires off pursuing our real dream of helping nice people like dr bahutu of nigeria who keeps emailing us asking for our help transferring some funds
834556 men often have more muscle mass than women not to say women cant be strong

834560 these people are not going to assist us because the moment they come back to gaza they are already suspected of being collaborators
834561 we do not waste time and effort on people who cannot help us
834562 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
834563 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately
834564 when you looked at his reaction when it happened there were natural moments that you cannot premeditate
834565 after the push armour took two or three steps because he still had his mind on the play then he turned around and went to the official to see if he was okay the natural reaction under stress is the truth so i have little doubt it was an incident of being blocked into the official
834566 it was a struggle out there it wasnt easy but everyones support just got me through this just feels so good right now
834567 it doesnt feel all that early it feels like a lifetime coming
834568 its been a dream of mine since i was about 12 its just a huge stepping stone for me
834569 he had a couple of really good opportunities to close the gap he missed the birdie putt on 13 and i made a great par putt just like i did on 12
834570 brian had some opportunities to really put the heat on me and i was feeling it
834571 i was just gutting it out i didnt have much left in the tank im spent right now
834572 yeah but you thought you were jon bon jovi its a good thing you grew out of that their jeans so tight is it because they think theyre emus
834573 oh look at that oh look over there oh wow come see this
834574 every student reaches a plateau where progress is not discernible it is very easy to become depressed after an inspiring workshop knowledge tends to come in spurts especially after enlightened reading a class or workshop so that awareness jumps way ahead of skill which proceeds at its own steady pace when the gap is wide and skill development seems to lag a long way behind the student may get discouraged and give up realize that on the contrary this period is one of great potential advancement because the knowledge of how to progress is there even though your present skill level cannot yet achieve it

834583 there is a business side to this health care costs are expensive and if we dont manage it they can get out of control
834584 this is a way to manage it and the side benefits to this are remarkable better morale and happier healthier people
834585 but then they started asking what are you doing in the area of wellness and they discussed different things people do there
834586 were seeing some fairly dramatic improvements in the health of employees
834587 so i can design wellness initiatives to help combat or improve those wellness scores
834588 this a strategy of chronic and regular communication and an opportunity for people to keep themselves healthier
834589 its a great service to our community and to our staff our employees cant get these kind of tests done for the price that mainland offers to us
834590 early detection is a huge factor in health and wellness
834591 our program is a win win because we are focused on the needs of both the employer and the employee
834592 health care is the largest cost of doing business today and employers are having to pay more
834593 what we do is say lets work together lets make the right things happen
834594 yet i am confident that i will see the lords goodness while i am here in the land of the living

834732 new short term and long term solutions to the energy crisis that were facing
834733 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good here
834734 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for moving us in the direction of energy independence then thats something im open to
834735 im not giving the gavel away to a tactic that supports the oil companies big oil at the cost and the expense of the consumer
834736 basically cools the passion of environmentalists knowing its not going anywhere while he is open to compromise on a comprehensive package that would achieve many other objectives
834737 barack obama says this weekend maybe eh and if but

834739 there are instructions on how to make it on their web sites
834740 its one thing to be an activist its another to be an extremist
834741 its absolutely outrageous that you would bring this kind of an attack to a family all because of your passion over this cause to me its indicative of people who have a complete inability to articulate their point in a constructive manner
834742 trying to send a message to this guy who wont listen to reason that if he doesnt stop hurting animals more drastic measures will be taken its certainly not an initial tactic but a tactic of last resort
834743 is aimed at understanding how brain connections form during development with special focus on the visual system
834744 so we can learn how to fix these connections after damage due to injury or disease
834745 i feel bad that anyone would take that drastic a step to harm people
834746 the downstairs was so smoky that we could not see
834747 my wife and children all escaped out of the bedroom window using a fire escape ladder a neighbor and then the fire department came and put out the fire
834748 i remember sitting here in 2005 after winning the june race and this track is real gratifying to win here a lot of great drivers have done very well here and it just means a lot to be on the list of people who have won here
834749 osborne did a great job i wasnt so sure about halfway through when were yelling at each other but bob did an unbelievable job
834750 the rain comes and were not sure what we wanted to do
834751 it was a stressful day but it worked out for us we both had a good time doing it and thats why were here to win and have a good time
834752 i love road courses theyre a lot of fun weve historically had pretty good luck at both sonoma and watkins glen were leaving here with a smile on our face and looking forward to next weekend

834757 to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me at the beginning there i was just up underneath somebody and think the no 78 just got in the back there we all kind of got jammed up i dont think it was anybodys fault but it worked out good we were able to work on our car and just kept making it better all day

834764 the lead classroom will be a place where differentiated instruction will thrive it is designed to specialize in individualized instruction since it will contain students from two grade levels those who demonstrate aptitude and ability in particular areas will have the unique opportunity to gain exposure to content otherwise not possible
834765 it is neither a remedial class nor an accelerated class it is a heterogeneous blend of our student population in a unique and supportive setting
834766 i was the only seventh eighth grade social studies teacher i absolutely loved it it was an opportunity to stretch student minds and social development than is possible in a typical classroom setting
834767 the school breakfast and lunch program is required to be self sufficient because it is not funded by school taxes
834768 lunch prices have remained unchanged since 2004 for grades k to five and since 2005 for grades six through 12 during that time the costs of fruit vegetables meat bread and dairy products have risen dramatically without a lunch price increase expenditures were projected to outpace revenues over the next year
834769 nobody likes to increase prices but the economy forces us to do so
834770 still i feel that the increase is not that great and the children are still getting a quality lunch at a reasonable price
834771 we dont mind the prices going up if the foods healthy
834772 all kinds of kids are wandering the streets all the time
834773 they ran like gazelles before i even got out of the car
834774 take the kids away from the opportunity and you dont have the crime sitting home with playstation is different than sitting on a street corner with friends where theres nothing to do but dares and screw around
834775 we have been having a bunch of incidents where were chasing down kids who are damaging trees the cemetery the school playground the park
834776 its usually the same kids under 17 just out wandering all night long after dark
834777 it started out with five or six kids hanging around
834778 then more and more came suddenly we all realized we had kids here from other towns the fighting started slapping punching it escalated and then escalated again
834779 it got them off the streets by 10 p m and there are no longer gangs and gangs of kids
834780 one trip home to their parents and its usually the last time it happens
834781 suddenly nobody knew nothin and no one wanted to say anything
834782 the timeframe of sunday through thursday of 10 p m i thought was a little early at first
834783 i thought id like to see it go 11 p m sunday through thursday and midnight the other two nights but then i read the curfew and it made sense why is there a 14 year old out at 1 a m and do the parents even know about it
834784 a couple of weeks ago we had a pretty little tree on the street in front of our house
834785 now we dont random acts of meaningless violence have been happening in our village a curfew will address that
834786 but i dont believe our residents should have to be harassed by a group of kids
834787 but when kids are running around town after midnight theres nothing good about that
834788 with society the way it is theres no good that is done that late
834789 i see kids late at night riding their bikes and walking the sidewalk and i wonder if their parents know theyre out there
834790 gt chris bjorling second councilor in the pageant presidency stands before the recently constructed 6 000 square foot building which has a wide range of uses during the pageant season by camy sorbello messenger post correspondent
834791 i was president of the rotary that year and the lds church sent out letters to all the area service clubs for a meeting at the hill cumorah visitors center the lds people explained that they wanted to be able to offer the patrons food service for the first time ever
834792 each group could set up a food booth and sell what they wanted at a fair price
834793 most of them thought it was too big an undertaking to do individually so i suggested combining into one booth
834794 its all volunteer and its the biggest one we do its a year in the planning
834795 the visitors appreciate what we do and are happy to know the money stays in the community
834796 its been a real plus for us but a lot of work
834797 the executive committee has to meet year round to coordinate it all up to 40 people are working on weekends and its a family effort
834798 working with the church is great and theyre so generous to the community
834799 back in 1991 when we started this we had no idea what we were going to do
834800 after two years as v p i felt that it was only natural to take the next step and run for the position
834801 i tried to talk former president john kratzert into a third term but was unsuccessful so i felt that i had to step up and run
834802 i will however continue to help provide the best education possible for the students in this district
834803 having been president for the last two years has been very interesting and challenging
834804 however due to increasing family and work obligations i determined that i would not be able to commit enough time and energy to being an effective board officer
834805 i am certainly sorry to see john kratzert choose not to seek the position of president as i believe he has brought incredible stability insight and integrity to the district through his board leadership
834806 however i respect his recognition of his own personal and vocational commitments and making his family a priority
834807 the board member with the most years of service and experience on a number of committees
834808 sharon lang is a good board member and would have made a fine v p but i think my experience made me a better candidate in the eyes of the majority of the board
834809 one thing to take away from this election is not to dwell on who actually won the election but that we maintain a positive working relationship among the board
834810 as i stated on election night i am against it
834811 we have worked hard trying to gain the publics trust again by being honest and open with the pal mac community and i see this as a small step backward i also understand the concerns of some of my fellow board members who felt uncomfortable because after their vote was made with a show of hands last year they felt they were treated with a certain amount of disrespect from people who knew how they voted
834812 i was not in favor of it but i went along with the wishes of the board
834813 what we do in public session should be public this will be one of the things that i will address during my term
834814 to break even we would have to charge a minimum of 5 per quarter per water customer
834815 the assessor for the town of manchester is new and relying on numbers coming from new york state
834816 no i did not and thats the only comment i have on that right now
834817 it wasnt a secret some people might say are you crazy i was interviewing pal mac just as much as they were interviewing me
834818 i like interacting with people and i feel im a good listener
834819 i truly believe that pal mac is an incredible school despite the bumps that weve had this year
834820 theres always going to be struggles but if we remain student focused well get through those bumps
834821 connecting with people i understood what was lost why there was the sense of not total trust
834822 it was poor choices made by key players in the district
834823 things like that tend to explode into pal mac is not a good place
834824 you cant ignore the past but i say honor it learn from what happened
834825 there have been some long days but if i couldnt be at concerts and athletic events i couldnt do this job i know first hand whats happening at pal mac
834826 were ready when customers want it the option of smaller engines well do it

834829 through its power to arrange ritual life the government attempted to impose its own political concerns on the cosmos by restructuring time which was still in the renaissance a comparatively flexible dimension defined by the saints feast and the office hours of the church rather than by the inexorable mechanisms of the modern age

834855 one that may prove to be a crowning moment in an illustrious career
834856 i think its had an effect on my psyche because every one of those scenes is one that i dont want to have in my own life
834857 violet doesnt want to sit down and be interrogated every scene is something she really doesnt want to have except when shes drugged out and then she seems to be comfortable
834858 ive been acting all my life and ive always felt you should be in shape im used to devoting my whole life to the work and what it requires
834859 estelle has so much stamina and so much energy and she has stayed working and never retired

834861 i dont know that ill be able to do this play at 80

834864 its very hard when youre in a movie that big you become notorious and people often bothered me in public
834865 those people i hiked with hardly ever knew who i was

834938 you have to take every inch you can with these guys in this class legends was a lot more laid back it might be the track we ran at chemung speedway that made it that way but i think the real reason is that the people that race in that class dont have as much money as some of these guys do in the late model class they have to take care of their equipment more
834939 im trying to get up to the nascar level of racing

834956 that was nice to see because our offensive line has done a tremendous job as well zac cooper off the edge is fast i was pleased with what i saw from pat liebig and this chris neild youngster just keeps getting better and better
834957 these linebackers are like boxers down there doing their drills
834958 its very physical and thats why they are so good they play downhill they attack and thats really really good
834959 it was second and about 10 and pat made a good read and threw it back to the x hogan broke on it and he was that close from going back 65 yards the other way
834960 dave lockwood jumped jeff casteel jumped was that close to making a big time play that david lockwood said guys last spring didnt make or couldnt make
834961 i saw him one time pat went off his first and second because the line did a great job blocking bam he hits stewart is still concerned about tailback depth although performed much better on sunday with a full day of practice under his belt stepped up a little bit more today
834962 now we didnt have pads on but he was a little bit more knowledgeable today as he should be
834963 he came late and its very crucial that he knows what is going on
834964 it may be the first game the 10th game or maybe next year
834965 i dont know how to answer that weve had great players here like steve slaton and patrick white and they get out there and go they just go as a coach you just cant nurture every little move you have to call your plays and hope they get it
834966 hes going to be a real treat for us if we can get him ready
834967 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
834968 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
834969 i want to push that into onenote so i can add it to my project make some comments about it etc now you can export outlook notes to onenote lots of people use outlooks notes feature to keep track of little scraps of info or rather they
834970 jeanette use the clip function just like you would in ie just make sure that you have onenote set to keep the window on top you can actually do a screen clipping in any program
834971 this page contains changes that could not be merged during synchronization click here to show versions of the page with unmerged changes

834973 the other day i got an email inviting me to download an entire course on how to manage email and tasks effectively something everyone in corporate settings struggles with and it came as a onenote notebook
834974 if you have any trial version installed you will fail validation
834975 you got us hooked on publisher by including it in the suite and now you want us to buy it separately while forcing this new thing i never heard of on us when we dont want it
834976 i just purchased a copy of microsoft onenote my life will never be the same
834977 the greatest invention in human history i vote for microsoft onenote
834978 i cant believe im so excited over some program that m came up with its probably just all the adrenaline thats been pumping through me lately
834979 yes i pre accept the terms of the universe and i embrace in advance what i am presently incapable of understanding
834980 saw up on ebay and i was wonderig if anyone cared to buy it here is the action if anyones interested
834981 from utter destruction and mayhem so i feel that all is well and i can relax and then i can either bake cookies and eat all the dough before it goes in the oven which is what id prefer to do
834982 would be an appropriate image to carry in my mind as i sprint toward the finish line and a nice cold micro brew
834983 i believe party unity calls for the delegates from florida and michigan to be able to participate fully alongside the delegates from the other states and territories
834984 this is a great opportunity for ncsoft to grow its expanding portfolio of triple a massively multiplayer games beyond traditional retail channels
834985 of course we think this is a huge value to our customers the incomm cards provide an incredibly convenient way for our customers to access our games and by using the cards theyll be getting some bonus items that will enhance their game play experience
834986 the prepaid card market continues to grow year over year
834987 we are thrilled to have one of the leading mmo publishers as an addition to our growing portfolio of prepaid game cards with its limited packaging the incomm card provides consumers with a green alternative to their game purchases plus it adds flexibility and other offerings that consumers can appreciate
834988 in setting the stage for our upcoming plans for the ip we felt the time was right to truly consolidate the city of heroes and city of villains universe
834989 we have removed all restrictions that were created when city of villains launched in order to make way for some really cool content and features we have in the pipeline this is an evolution of the ip that lays the foundation for whats to come
834990 we know that character variety is one of our greatest strengths and thats why our players love to create new characters
834991 even former players who reactivate will be pleasantly surprised to see new open character slots waiting for them
834992 having the bling gnome around can be highly lucrative and useful providing players with lots of back end profits
834993 actually this is a pretty innovative tool for mmogs and we are excited about the response our players are having towards this feature the bling gnome is exclusive to the new retail pack but those who purchase that box will get a great value with 6 months membership level for the cost of four as well as the bling gnome which should help any players bottom dollar
834994 ive been able to do some very exciting things in the games business but nothing of this magnitude
834995 im thrilled we can offer the once in a lifetime chance to millions of gamers to virtually go to space with me a select few will have their dna digitized and sent and theoretically if anything happens to the human race it could be their dna that is used to resurrect humanity
834996 while everyone can participate in the polls at tabula rasa players will be the only gamers in the universe who can say that a piece of them is in space since were sending their in game alter egos and for some their dna to space with me

834999 i dont know but today my heart is singing because
835000 we reallize that this behavior is bad poor unintuitive but we cant change it at this point without breaking applications that depend upon it
835001 i wonder if therell be bacon and eggs waiting for me when i get home from this circus
835002 the only way to obtain them is while debugging using visual studio 2008
835003 youll be able to download the net framework source libraries via a standalone install allowing you to use any text editor to browse it locally
835004 oh but developers might create paths with invalid characters and spaces at the end
835005 it doesnt make too much sense for an application to redistribute static tz data
835006 use onshutdown to specify the processing that occurs when the system shuts down often onshutdown will be similar to the processing in onstop this event occurs only when the operating system is shut down not when the computer is turned off onshutdown is expected to be overridden when the canshutdown property is true
835007 0x 0 is out of the range of the int32 data type
835008 0 is out of the range of the int32 data type
835009 0 is out of the range of the int32 data type
835010 because leading zeroes are always dropped from the non decimal string representations of numeric values
835011 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody
835012 im not going to get into that i learned my lesson
835013 it will not be a speech about campaign issues hes not going to address campaign issues in terms of other candidates it is not a speech about american politics and so its not a campaign event were not trying to recruit support from the crowds that are coming
835014 the point of the outdoor rally is that the senator wants to speak directly to our allies and to the people of europe and the people of the world and it would be inconsistent to do that and try to limit the attendance for that event theres a great deal of interest in his visit we want to accommodate that interest
835015 anda harus berbicara dengan fa untuk mengetahui apakah mereka tertarik untuk menawarkan kepada saya pekerjaan itu
835016 saya tidak dapat mengatakan apa pikiran saya sampai mereka nanti menyatakan mereka tertarik

835020 police have taken samples of the alcohol they were drinking and just want to find out what was in it
835021 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
835022 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
835023 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
835024 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality
835025 if they manage to find a particular product at a particular supermarket the price has probably changed anyway
835026 thats not real world thats not the way people shop theyre not going to sit on the internet going through thousands of product items
835027 they cant grocery prices are going up because of the drought theyre going up because of a huge surge in global demand theyre going up because arable land is being used to produce things like ethanol
835028 its just a cover for the fact that labor cant do anything about grocery prices and they shouldnt have told the australian people that they could
835029 might get some type of injection in a couple of days
835030 the way jerry blevins is throwing and brad ziegler is throwing i could potentially use anybody in any situation right now
835031 i dont want to say that huston street is no longer the closer it might be more how well the other two guys are doing
835032 its experienced a lot of close games throughout the year and thats really helped them
835033 that was my fault and the error it happens youve just got to get past it and we did
835034 ive been seeing it good the past week or so and i felt good up there
835035 hopefully keep pushing until theres nothing left people might underestimate us but weve shown we can play
835036 i felt probably the best i have felt all season to be honest
835037 pretty much everything was working i have been working on a slider forever and i actually got some people with that tonight when youve got everything working and you get good defense behind you its pretty easy to get outs
835038 when he got in trouble he really hung in there well he was tough when he had to be and we got some big hits
835039 deacon jones said i was gonna cry you bet im gonna cry
835040 you bet youre life im gonna cry you bet your life i will thats my boy thats my boy right there
835041 my dad always used to give me and my sister advice like most kids we didnt always follow that advice
835042 a piece of advice he gave me once was never make athletes your heroes because they make mistakes too i guess i didnt follow that advice very well id like to introduce you to my hero my mentor my father emmitt thomas
835043 my late grandfather is still my hero i remember those long hot summer nights sitting on the porch listening to a game or a fight
835044 he taught me about honor commitment love religion and respect
835045 it happens when youre protecting someone like john elway and what happens is the night before the game you get little or no sleep
835046 because if you didnt do your job youll forever be known as the guy who lost our franchise i would also like to thank john it was worth every sleepless night
835047 in my youth i watched every game i could i studied all the great players lambert ham bobby bell and many others
835048 i have not played my very best when trying to get in on the last week or two
835049 i was hitting shots with too many goals in mind instead of just trying to hit it close to the hole or down the fairway or knock it in the hole i was trying to make the team with every shot it sounds absurd but in a way thats the way i was going about it
835050 its a great feeling to know im going to be on the team and not have to worry about it
835051 this time im thinking about it because it was my no 1 goal
835052 its on your mind but your golf will take care of itself if you dont play well you dont deserve to be on the team
835053 the pga championship is one of the four biggest tournaments of the year and the players need to prepare like they would any other week
835054 disregard the ryder cup if its meant for them to be there theyll be there its as simple as that dont try too hard thats the main thing
835055 you try to pretend its not on your mind but its on your mind
835056 the only way to make the ryder cup team is having two good weeks and thats worry about the little stuff sticking to your routine making sure youre prepared its all in my hands
835057 i was trying to win to get all those points
835058 after i hit my first bad shot i didnt say hit it in the middle of the green and make 5 i was trying to win the golf tournament from 240 yards away
835059 ive really taken a lot of pressure off this ryder cup
835060 ive been down that road where you try so hard that it gets in the way im just going to play and if i make it it will be a great accomplishment

835067 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
835068 shiloh and z pick out the twins clothes and help change and hold them
835069 its hard to stand out against those thats some pretty good competition but it doesnt make it any less
835070 its a major and its one id love to win
835071 its always gotten a bad rap but i still perceive it as one thats very important being the fourth one maybe guys build up a tolerance of the pressure and everything but again its a major a lot of guys get their first major win there so it provides a lot of hope for a lot of players
835072 ive got a newfound energy for the end of the season
835073 we were looking for something that said this is the seasons final major and your last shot at glory
835074 when you win a tournament on the tour you go into the record books when you win a major you go into the history books
835075 there were people who thought the association was wrong for giving up on match play
835076 but if you look back television was coming on and match play didnt lend itself to tv the other thing about match play is that golf was becoming more popular and with the gallery being so large you got to the semifinals and had 25 000 people trying to watch two matches
835077 you run the risk of not having tiger in the final
835078 and im not sure they got the attendance they hoped for
835079 if it turned out like this year everybody would love match play
835080 but if tiger and phil go out in the first two rounds everybody goes home imagine planning your whole year around watching tiger or phil play in the pga you get a saturday ticket and theyre already gone
835081 if you had to rank it the pga is probably fourth on everyones list
835082 but ask a player if he wants to win it and ill guarantee hell tell you yes when it comes to winning a major it really doesnt matter which one
835083 im going to be a mom someday when i grow up im going to have a baby
835084 being able to sep floyd glasses look alright i have to wear mine because could neve poha i love that you participate in the discussion i agree th ryan well im not much of a fan of religion however i am a fan o lceel im from chicago land of bumpy streets and sewer backups
835085 ritters efforts to give collective bargaining rights to state employees stoked opposition among republicans in particular
835086 excellent good and fair are positive rankings and if you add those categories up they add up to 69 percent
835087 nantinya menurut undang undang uu nomor 17 tahun 2008 tentang pelayaran syahbandar itu hanya satu misalnya di pelabuhan umum syahbandar cukup satu sementara itu di pelabuhan lain yang berada di wilayah lingkungan kerja perikanan akan menjadi pembantu syahbandar
835088 syahbandar di dua pelabuhan itu sebenarnya sama karena yang melatih juga dari dephub
835089 jadi ada dua sib ini terjadi di beberapa pelabuhan tertentu ini keluhan nelayan karena memakan biaya
835090 misalnya memberi makan anak buah kapal abk kapal perikanan sesuai dengan juklak dirjen tangkap dikeluarkan selama 2x24 jam jika tidak sib batal dan dia harus ajukan kembali bisa lebih dari dua hari itu paling cepat
835091 i hate modern technology im not a computer person and i dont like change
835092 but i tried it and it was one of the easiest things ive done
835093 it offers some very good opportunities for school districts to better screen visitors
835094 there are probably dozens of different solutions out there and we need to make sure we get the most for our dollars
835095 show them how big and bad we are and theyll submit to our will
835096 we are in the strongest possible position to demonstrate that if iran does not act then it is time to go back to that sanctions track
835097 iran has a clear choice to make suspend its nuclear program and accept our offer of negotiations or face growing isolation and the collective response not just of one nation but of all nations around the world
835098 indecisive about whether to lean on diplomacy or the military option
835099 it was also a very strong message to the iranians that they cant go and stall and make small talk and talk about culture and that they have to make a decision
835100 but at least its not two guys thats really disgusting
835101 as long as some guys not kissing you against your will why does it matter
835102 and forgive me but im not the same guy you knew in high school im a good christian now and that kind of thing is just plain un christian
835103 usually people use religion to simply justify their political and social biases why is it that some christians think homosexuality is wrong but not touching a woman during her period and list a few of what you list
835104 and what was said in that room would be enough to convict us all of something
835105 gramm says now of course you know there cant be any legal connection between this money and senator packwood but we know that it will be used for his benefit the gramm aide said oh yes god theres packwood chief of staff elaine franklin and i sitting there i think thats a felony im not sure this is an area of the law i dont want to know
835106 the work of this congress will be seen as a watershed where we turned away from an outmoded depression era approach to financial regulation and adopted a framework that will position our financial services industry to be world leaders into the new century
835107 if i bought groceries the way i buy health insurance id eat a lot better and so would my dog
835108 i have the most reliable friend you can have in american politics and that is ready money
835109 im carrying so much pork im beginning to get trichinosis
835110 the reality is clintons so called tax cut is basically giving money to people who largely dont pay taxes so that its really spending rather than a tax cut
835111 its not fair to say that people who work with their head or with their hands ought to pay taxes but people who earn their living with capital ought not to
835112 they filmed that show in the texas school book depository building in the same room that oswald was in when he shot president kennedy
835113 when you see me in misery come on baby see about me i need a drink
835114 when we got there we found this scared kid from alabama who had never even seen that many people in one place before we backed up percy sledge on his first gig outside of his hometown we must have played when a man loves a woman about 50 times it was the only song he knew at that point
835115 i dont know i thought it sounded good more professional you know
835116 we can handle it ill bring in some of the guys from jefferson street
835117 recorded at bradleys barn piano organ bob wilson bass billy cox drums freeman brown guitar chip young arranger aaron varnell harmony voices sam baker and roscoe shelton lattimore sam and roscoe overdubbed the vocals simultaneously with one microphone standing with their arms around each other like three brothers their voices had a beautiful beautiful blend the impressions had nothing on these three guys
835118 they had the whole basement set up like a night club with little cocktail tables and everything people would get up on this tiny stage built out of two by fours and plywood and just jam all night
835119 i was a surfer but i was not listening to the beach boys
835120 the guys that i ran with we were listening to the stanley brothers and other bluegrass players
835121 i saw him play with del mccoury kenny baker and brad bill keith
835122 theres only one thing i regret from when i joined the byrds in 64
835123 i put the mandolin down i lost a lot of time im still trying to figure out things that i was starting to figure out in 64
835124 stephen said to somebody go get that thing i got for chris
835125 i hated the sound of that mandolin you were playing in colorado
835126 when you get older you play less notes and more melody
835127 but every generation hands the mantle to the next and thats as it should be
835128 its loud and it plays easy but i also have great affection for bill collings mandolins
835129 i like it i go there a lot ive bought and sold some mandolins on the classifieds
835130 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
835131 im not in a position to speculate on who this is or why they have carried out this action
835132 but any time there is an attack on diplomatic establishment it is more or less by definition is an act of terrorism
835133 our countries will stand together to confront this as we have confronted some other problems in the past
835134 the democrat will raise your taxes and kill your children
835135 pro life thus implying that everyone who disagrees with them is
835136 i dont like him because hes going to raise taxes
835137 but only on those people making 250 000 or more
835138 sneak over the border most come here by plane and just stay
835139 hell yeah now get the hell out of our country
835140 we face with the iranians and so do our allies and friends a growing missile threat that is getting ever longer and ever deeper and where the iranian appetite for nuclear technology is still unchecked

835142 a worldwide community of photographers provided valuable insight and feedback as part of the lightroom 2 public beta program ultimately helping us deliver a better product
835143 weve considered their requests which helped us develop useful features that make it easier than ever for our customers to quickly refine enhance and present brilliant photographs
835144 one of the big reasons why lightroom has become such a phenomenon among serious photographers is that adobe built it with the input of a very vocal user community
835145 adobe really listens to the issues and challenges todays photographers face and theyve built a complete solution that not only meets the needs of photographers it really feels like it was made just for us the enhancements to lightroom 2 combined with the power of photoshop give photographers the ultimate freedom to produce professional images quickly

835164 well since you did dispute it 6 mos ago we will forego making you pay for it in the future however you cant include a written notice you have to call us to cancel things like that
835165 addressing another point upthread the thing about thinking feeling judging is that people truly tend to experience the world through different lenses when they say they feel something often thats a clue that they generally experience the world more vividly in say an emotional way it does little good to tell such a person that they actually think or believe something more useful is to parse it for yourself and try to use their language when you want to get your own point across

835189 the sticking points include a proposal to delay paying residuals on movies and tv shows until producers have recouped their costs guild negotiators said the guild also is proposing doubling payments on profits made from dvd sales and providing union pay and benefits to writers working in reality television and on basic cable shows
835190 sufficiently compensated from the online streams of shows such as
835191 shows are written about four to six episodes in advance while the rest are written week to week
835192 if writers strike early then by december the airing of many shows will basically shut down

835214 god bless america keep us protected keep us long term safe keep us free keep us prosperous
835215 god what do we need to do to be blessed
835216 to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had given to israel
835217 and ezra the priest brought the law the torah he brought it before the assembly of all the men and women all who listen with understanding the first day of the seventh month and he read from it before the scroll which was in front of the water gate from early morning till midday in the presence of men and women those who could understand and all the people were attentive to the book of the law
835218 and ezra in verse 5 opened the book in the sight of all the people he was standing above them all and he opened it all the people stood up and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen while lifting up their hands then they bowed low and worshiped the lord with their faces to the ground
835219 and they read from the book from the law of god translating to give the sense so that they could understand the reading
835220 he read from the book of the law daily from the first day to the last day they celebrated the feast seven days on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly according to the ordinance
835221 on the twenty fourth day of this month the sons of israel
835222 assembled with fasting in sack cloth and dirt upon them
835223 the descendants of israel separated themselves from all foreigners stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers
835224 and while they stood in their place they read from the book of the law of the lord their god for a fourth of a day and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped their god
835225 arise bless the lord your god forever and ever o may thy glorious name be blessed and exalted above all blessing and praise thou alone art the lord thou hast made the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all that is in them
835226 thou didst bear with them for many years and admonished them with thy spirit through thy prophets yet they would not give ear therefore thou didst give them into the hand of the peoples of the lands nevertheless in thy great compassion thou didst not make an end of them or forsake them for thou art a gracious and compassionate god
835227 now therefore verse 32 our god the great the mighty the awesome god who dost keep covenant and lovingkindness do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before thee which has come upon us our kings our princes our priests our prophets our fathers and on all thy people from the days of the kings of assyria to this day however and i love this thou art just in all that has come upon us for thou hast dealt faithfully but we have acted wickedly
835228 yet the lord warned israel and judah through all his prophets and every seer saying turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you through my servants the prophets
835229 they rejected his statutes his covenants which he made with their fathers his warnings which he warned them they followed emptiness or vanity and became empty went after the nations which surrounded them concerning which the lord had commanded them not to be like them
835230 they forsook all the commandments of the lord their god they made for themselves molten images even two calves and made an asherah which is a form of an idol worshiped all the host of heaven served baal they made their sons and daughters pass through the fire literally incinerating their children in sacrifices to the idols they practiced divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord provoking him so the lord was very angry with israel and removed them from his sight none was left except the tribe of judah
835231 but also judah did not keep the commandments of the lord their god but walked in the customs which israel had introduced
835232 the lord verse 20 rejected all the descendants of israel afflicted them gave them into the hand of plunderers until he had cast them out of his sight
835233 but verse 19 if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them then i will uproot you from my land which i have given you and this house which i have consecrated for my name i will cast out of my sight
835234 i will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples
835235 if youre not careful to observe all the words of this law which are written in this book to fear this honored and awesome name the lord your god it shall come about that as the lord listen to this delighted to bless you and multiply you so the lord will delight over you to make you perish and destroy you
835236 but my people did not listen to my voice and israel did not obey me so i gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart to walk on their own devices
835237 god bless america god bless america when it is crystal clear that america is not interested in meeting the conditions of that blessing god bring america back to the truth of scripture god bring america to true penitence pray that
835238 be holy for i am holy be holy for i am holy be holy for i am holy
835239 god says every place on which the sole of your foot treads im going to give to you just as i promised moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even as far as the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites as far as the great sea toward the setting of the sun will be your territory
835240 but nobody verse 5 is going to be able to stand before you all the days of your life just as i have been with moses i will be with you i will not fail or forsake you nobody is going to be able to overthrow my ultimate purpose for you
835241 be strong courageous you shall give this people possession of the land which i swore to their fathers to give them
835242 be careful to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded you do not turn from it to the right or to the left so that you may have success wherever you go if you turn from the law of god i guarantee you will not have success you will not have prosperity you will not enjoy safety protection or well being
835243 this book of the law the word of god shall not depart from your mouth you shall meditate on it day and night learn it absorb it make it your own so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it for then you will make your way prosperous then you will have success
835244 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men heres the key phrase who suppress the truth in unrighteousness
835245 that which is known about god is evident within them for god made it evident to them
835246 from the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse
835247 even though they knew god because god had planted that knowledge in them they didnt honor him as god they didnt give him thanks they were futile empty in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible god for an image in the form of corruptible man of birds and four footed animals and crawling creatures
835248 god has allowed all the nations to go their own way
835249 for the wrath of god is revealed against all who do this
835250 were on the brink of a great revival in america
835251 i will go out as at other times and shake myself free
835252 but he didnt know that the lord had departed from him
835253 yet you have forsaken me and served other gods therefore i will deliver you no more
835254 god and cry out to the gods which youve chosen
835255 because i called and you refused i stretched out my hand and no one paid attention you neglected all my counsel you didnt want my reproof i will even laugh at your calamity i will mock when your dread comes when your dread comes like a storm your calamity like a whirlwind and distress and anguish comes on you then they will call on me but i will not answer
835256 because they hated knowledge did not choose the fear of the lord they will seek me diligently they will not find me they would not accept my counsel they spurned all my reproof so they shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be satisfied with their own devices im letting them go
835257 theyre blind leaders of the blind let them alone let them go im done with them
835258 god gave them over to the lust of their hearts to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them for they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever amen
835259 god also gave them over to degrading passions for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural
835260 in the same way also the men abandoned the function of the women and burned in their desire for one another men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own person the due penalty of their error
835261 unrighteousness fills everything wickedness greed evil envy murder strife deceit malice gossip slander haters of god insolent arrogant boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents with understanding untrustworthy unloving unmerciful everything breaks loose and the jerry springer show becomes funny to the degraded mind
835262 mark do you think theres anything that could happen that would shock these young people anything
835263 then the lord appeared to solomon at night and said to him i have heard your prayer have chosen this place for myself as a house of sacrifice if i shut up the heavens so that there is no rain or if i command the locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people
835264 my people who are called by my name if they humble themselves and pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven will forgive their sin and heal their land
835265 o that my people would listen to me that israel would walk in my ways if my people would just listen and obey i would quickly subdue their enemies
835266 if my people listen to me and walk in my ways i will feed you with the finest of the wheat and with honey from the rock i would satisfy you
835267 davids conscience bothered him because he had cut off the edge of sauls robe because saul was the lords anointed
835268 when i kept silent about my sin my body wasted away and through my groaning all day long night and day your hand was heavy on me my vitality my lifes juices were drained away
835269 i have sinned greatly in what ive done please o lord take away the iniquity of your servant ive acted very foolishly
835270 guilt is a pollutant and we dont need any more of it in the world
835271 no sin is as evil as the killjoy attitude of those who think someones behavior is an offense to some holy god
835272 if you want to kill sin load your conscience with the guilt of it generations are being trained that conscience is a liar they shouldnt feel guilty and you can do whatever you want because you have the freedom to be yourself and dont let anybody put some guilt trip on you or make you feel bad about it this is the depth of the morass of twisted thinking that america is in weve abandoned god and hes abandoned us weve plummeted down the path from immorality to homosexuality to degraded thinking weve slaughtered our conscience we dont have the word of god to inform conscience and when conscience tries to speak even weakly we crush it into silence and tell it it has no right to tell us anything were good the twinkies made me do it your child has add hdp odd or whatever other psychologization of morality we have a long ways to go in this country to expect blessing dont you think just getting back to god is a huge huge trek and getting back to guilt is another one we want god but we want him on our terms blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked nor stand in the path of sinners nor sit in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of the lord in his law he meditates day and night
835273 blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man to whom the lord does not impute iniquity
835274 blessed is the man who has made the lord his trust and has not turned to the proud nor to those who lapse into falsehood
835275 praise the lord this sums it up how blessed is the man who fears the lord who greatly delights in his commandments wealth and riches are in his house he will never fear evil tidings his heart is steadfast trusting in the lord his heart is upheld he will not fear
835276 seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while hes near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the lord and he will have compassion on him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon
835277 there is many as may be the promises of god all his promises of blessing obviously as many as may be the promises of god in him that is in christ jesus the son of god mentioned in verse 19 in him they are yes
835278 wherefore also by him is our amen to the glory of god through us
835279 in christ jesus the blessing of abraham comes to the gentiles so we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith
835280 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places what are the next two words in christ
835281 wasnt he in a jungle last time how the hell did he get here

835283 oh bother hes kicked the bucket trying to protect my ungrateful boyfriend oh well its his fault though since hes so stubborn hey peter lets go to canada
835284 inevitable result is the politicization of the faith its reduction to an instrument for social liberation
835285 the christ principle always includes the poor but the poor principle does not necessarily include christ

835346 theyre the thickest and gooiest of liquids and the most disordered and structureless of rigid solids
835347 they sit right at this really profound sort of puzzle
835348 the deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in solid state theory is probably the theory of the nature of glass and the glass transition
835349 this could be the next breakthrough in the coming decade
835350 i think we have a very good constructive theory of that these days
835351 many people tell me this is very contentious i disagree violently with them
835352 it is well known that panes of stained glass in old european churches are thicker at the bottom because glass is a slow moving liquid that flows downward over centuries well known but wrong
835353 it is sometimes said that glass in very old churches is thicker at the bottom than at the top because glass is a liquid and so over several centuries it has flowed towards the bottom this is not true
835354 but glass well theyre not really sure about that one no consensus yet
835355 the arrangement of atoms and molecules in glass is indistinguishable from that of a liquid

835359 can god create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift it
835360 to apply force to move an object counter to the direction of the gravitational pull on it
835361 could god create a rock so purple that he couldnt lift it
835362 can god place a rock somewhere that he could not lift it
835363 well can parliament make a law that binds parliament no no parliament can bind another because parliament is sovereign and omnipotent in a legal sense

835368 but that sucks there should be a big explosion and everybody dies and the universe is set on fire and everybodys guts are all over the place
835369 no what should happen is they should become intangible that way neither is stopped
835370 if god is omnipotent can he make pi equal to three
835371 newtons second law all forces are unstoppable no objects are immovable god cant even make a rock so big you cant move it as long as its in space and youve got some thrust to apply
835372 the question is specifically can god create a rock so heavy that he cannot lift it or some variation thereon
835373 can an omnipotent being manipulate the local conditions so he can never move a given object away from the centre of the local gravitational field
835374 why should people who think that such a question matters be running the world

835482 a contemporaneous record shall be created setting forth the nature and duration of each technique employed
835483 while the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the bush administrations torture policies even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use national security as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment criticism and possible criminal prosecution
835484 i know if i could keep up with her workouts football workouts are nothing compared to that

835575 democracy is the most sustainable way to maintain the distinction between powerful and powerless because it gives the greatest possible number of people incentive to defend that distinction
835576 this solves the problem of managing changes between my dev and production databases
835577 this ensures a set location for the latest and greatest db version and a structured method of moving db changes from the developer to the master copy of the db
835578 now we can instigate a code review process for our db changes
835579 as a dba i feel sometimes that devs want to keep dbas in the basement they want to make changes on their own when they can
835580 this product will give us an increase of shared knowledge between dba and developers
835581 this tool makes a really tough job for me much easier
835582 now we can have communication and tracking of bugs around our db
835583 i came to tech ed to check out this product for our group
835584 a dream would be to have an erd as well

835586 we want integration with existing standards and perhaps an automated rules engine
835587 clicking on an error did not take me to the error line even though the line number is displayed
835588 give us integration between the server explorer and import schema
835589 i want to use the query builder to make my query for the data bound generator oh and if i have only one result field from my query please autobind that to the column to be populated
835590 we manually track changes to the dev database and rolling changes into a master upgrade script
835591 individuals creating the change test it then it is tested as part of front end application testing
835592 we have test and staging servers and use sql delta to compare them after changes
835593 we get sql scripts periodically from the db and put them into scc
835594 our previous developer created access dbs then used a wizard to migrate to sql server the design was terrible but it produces 50 reports per day and cannot be taken offline to rearchitect your tool will let me work in a sandbox to make and test changes to the architecture and version while i fix this bad db
835595 our legacy db has no pk fk relationships despite this there are inter table and inter column dependencies in the db all handled through business logic i want to be able to declare these relationships in dgen and have population work as if a pk fk relationship existed updating the schema is not an option for us

835611 lumber and other people in b c and alberta who are seeing the pine beetles massive damage to the forests
835612 the mountain pine beetle epidemic in british columbia is coming to a close but only because the pests are running out of food a forestry representative says the spread has been attributed to the fact that b c is believed to have three times more mature lodgepole pine than it did 90 years ago mainly because equipment and techniques for protecting forests against wildfire have greatly improved over time
835613 the pine beetle populations are making their way across the rocky mountains into alberta because the pine stands have collapsed in many areas of bc
835614 the magnitude of the current outbreak has been attributed to two factors
835615 the second factor is climate change historically beetle populations have been limited by cold winters however the absence of cold temperatures in the interior has allowed large populations of beetles to successfully survive the winter under the bark of the pine trees furthermore the warming trend in the interior has produced ideal conditions for the mountain pine beetle hot dry summers have allowed the beetle infestation to spread to higher elevations and more northern latitudes while producing drought stressed trees which are more susceptible to attack
835616 funny that the mountain pine beetle epidemic in the rockies is attributed to the main factors of warmer temps and drought
835617 funny that the people who study the beetle know that cold winters help control the beetle but only if an early fall or late spring cold snap catches the critters by surprise
835618 we could run away you know start over tell them all to go to hell
835619 commodities have been the worst performing asset class behind stocks bonds and real estate for the past 200 years but wall street doesnt highlight that long history when selling commodity index instruments today instead it shows a chart of the bull market of the past 12 years to rationalize why some pensioner should be long cattle futures in the derivatives markets as part of a basket i am sure they were using similar logic about tulips three centuries ago

835623 i see them everywhere theyre languishing on doorsteps hanging out in the middle of the road dangling off street signs peeking out of piles of garbage reclining in the middle of the sidewalk riding the bus for free a great number of them are bright yellow as if theyre fresh and have just been dropped although they appear in all states of decay i dont know how or why they caught my attention but within a week of being in london i couldnt get my mind off these banana skins where were they coming from who was eating all these bananas and leaving the skins around why was it always bananas i was seeing and not say oranges was it a sign was there something sinister going on apparently these little hazards were a covert operation going completely unnoticed everyone i asked about it said that they had never noticed anything of the sort and looked at me as if i was nuts

835653 viacom has asked for far more data than that and theres only one use for that data to sue individual users or shake them down via the threat of lawsuit which has been perfected by the riaa who have watched a few music videos or television shows on youtube
835654 its taking the key portions and figuring out what are most important to your organization what are the outside threats risks and vulnerabilities that you need to consider and what is going to provide the most value to your organization defining a framework based on these industry standards that really fits your specific needs
835655 the poor approach is to say were going to do it grc and there are some automated tools available
835656 and lets implement these without really understanding what grc is what their objectives are whos going to use the information and how does it support their decision making
835657 theres no finish line with it grc its cyclical because the risks and the threats and the landscape outside is constantly going to be changing

835667 we believe its necessary to set ambitious and achievable goals and targets for combating homelessness for a start lets significantly reduce the numbers of rough sleepers and those in temporary insecure or substandard accommodation
835668 we need to dramatically decrease the flow of people coming into homelessness and improve service quality for those who are or at risk of being without accommodation
835669 what we need are individualised and flexible services which focus on each client as an individual not one size fits all
835670 we need to provide a combination of holistic services and accommodation with a focus on a persons health education welfare and employment getting a homeless person back on their feet is more than just about finding them a roof over their head
835671 we would also encourage more integrated services this stops the client having to run around between different agencies and services where they might have to be assessed again and again and eventually slip through the cracks
835672 navigating various unintegrated agencies can be very intimidating if youre a vulnerable homeless person
835673 a new phase of jihad man stabbed to death and decapitated on bus in canada
835674 i can think of only one explanation for this news blackout
835675 it is that the killer is indeed a muslim and that the news is so shocking its implications so frightening canadians might be slaughtered and beheaded anywhere any time that the ultra pc canadian authorities cant handle it
835676 because if the killer is a muslim as seems very likely
835677 it would mean that canada and every western country with a musulman population has now become like israel where death by islam can occur to anyone any time any place
835678 and hes not a muslim at least by his name
835679 i f there is anyone thinking based on the fact that the beheading suspect is apparently not a muslim that i was premature in guessing that he is one think about what that says about your attitudes and assumptions
835680 there is one group in the world for whom beheadings are central to their religion and culture in every country where islamic law is in effect muslims behead criminals
835681 the likelihood of a muslim inspiration should not be dismissed
835682 tapes of beheadings yes done by muslims have been available on the web for years
835683 a chinese muslim li expressed to investigators that his actions were motivated by the koran
835684 if this is true then my controversial guess that the killer was muslim followed by my theory that the canadian authorities were covering up his muslim status in order to prevent a mass anti muslim reaction was accurate but we dont know that its true
835685 if he went to a baptist church even just a few times he could not have been any kind of devout muslim

835711 intensely erotic and compelling flesh tones explores the disturbing realm that lies between love and obsession
835712 it was two oclock in the morning on a hot humid saturday in july when i was awakened by my faithful companion and sidekick canine calamity jane whining and whimpering at the back door as if she were in dire need to visit the canine facilities stationed in the tallest of the grass by the fence known as the drop zone
835713 i struggled to raise myself up from a sound and comfortable sleep turn on a light search for my glasses that always seem to be in a different place from where they were the night before when i removed them from my sleep deprived eyes
835714 i put on my glasses and struggled at deciding if i should put on just my jeans to go outside into the dark and unknowing night or should i put on a shirt also knowing that the mosquitoes are large enough to stand flat footed and kiss a turkey on the lips
835715 i decided to go ahead with the shirt and jeans to be on the safe side of insect buffet coverage
835716 during my time of properly clothing myself to let the always faithful calamity visit the ladies room of colorful brown and turning brown grass due to the fact of no rain calamity was whining a little louder and with more zeal in anticipation of trying to restore moisture to her special part of the yard
835717 i realized by her volume that she was in a hurry and by her tone that she wanted me to pick up the pace also so i did
835718 i heard her yelp and i figured she ran into winky the giant shop cat who has run of the yard or something winky had dragged up from a night of prowling through his jungle made specifically for felines but no
835719 i hurried to see what calamity had cornered and with complete and total assurance i can say i wish i had stayed in bed and let calamity use the living room floor to relieve herself
835720 as i hurriedly made the turn around the back of the boat parked in the yard with flashlight in hand i came face to face with the most dreaded and aggressive creatures that roam the countrysides and lurk only during the night when no one can see them
835721 i had the flashlight fixed directly on him and nothing else to protect myself with
835722 i knew that if i turned and ran it would not help so all i could do is keep the light from the now dimming flashlight in his eyes and slowly start my retreat by taking slow steps backwards until i was a safe distance from this fur covered aggressive man hunter
835723 now i am far enough away that he cant reach me i start calling calamity trying to get her out of harms way but if you know calamity and her breed once she has her mind on something you might as well wait until she gets bored with it because she wont even hear your pleas much less a command to leave whatever has her attention alone
835724 she stood there holding her ground between where i was and this bastardly beast of the rural country
835725 bravely and without fear for herself she jumps and barks snarling and snapping trying to force this demon to run away into the black of the night from whence it came
835726 the skunk did not spray me but when i saw calamity get hit with it i grabbed her and immediately dumped her fragrant and whining body into that water tank that was about half full in order to try and get as much off as i could i got into the tank myself and dunked her under the water while scrubbing on her
835727 i think now i am going out behind my workshop and burn the clothes i had on

835751 who wants parking spaces to be the hallmark of a development
835752 tysons today is a shambles because its office buildings are surrounded by parking and clogged arteries
835753 if theres a free parking space youre irrational if you dont drive
835754 you drove your tractor here at least my grandparents did the parking and the driving is a mindset people in northern virginia are drivers
835755 the market quickly figured out that you didnt need as much parking
835756 the idea that every car needs a parking place for every separate place that car goes is what has caused this spread out landscape
835757 tysons is in transition it cant realize the opportunity to create a great place when theres a giant parking lot wherever you look

835759 and i was so surprised to see a liquor department i just want to be clear for the record will this particular target or will it not have a liquor department
835760 its a lot based on the policies of the locale its state by state the supertargets go in typically ask for the wine and spirits you know they typically have the beer the full selection the newer general merchandise stores these days like to sell wine but it does depend on the jurisdiction and that conditional use if liquor is a separate entitlement or separate conditional use it would be in this store if it would be the wine is what would be asked for
835761 think theres no such thing as too much parking take a look at tysons corner where theres more parking than jobs more parking than office space more parking than in downtown washington
835762 theyre going to be like dandelions theyre going to be everywhere
835763 all over the place theyre putting in these roundabouts somebody has this idea that its a good thing and theyre pushing it
835764 a roundabout has equal weight to a traffic signal and the safety benefits are substantial
835765 you cant go through a roundabout at high speed and your t bone crashes are virtually eliminated
835766 the chances of killing someone at 20 mph are substantially less than the chances of killing someone at 55 mph
835767 theres probably a low sense of comfort when youre going through them maybe youre a bit nervous
835768 after spending decades constructing roads in residential areas that encourage speed and inattentive driving traffic engineers wise up
835769 this is just the beginning more and more people will come to realize that what were doing is not working

835771 the people of maricopa dont want to be a bedroom community a city of rooftops
835772 its done its not going to work as a housing strategy anymore
835773 the trends that pushed housing demand toward distant suburbs and rural areas were not sustainable
835774 the problem is that it can be two three four times as expensive to develop in close in neighborhoods vs outlying neighborhoods if theres any space at all
835775 reducing commuting costs trying to be more environmentally conscious and trying to find the cheapest housing affect decisions simultaneously
835776 thats not all that bad theres nothing like a crisis to get people to try something
835777 the perfect moment to be doing everything were talking about
835778 some people will say for 300 000 to 325 000 what are my options to live closer maybe its a smaller home do they want to drive or do they want to be five or 10 minutes from their office people will make the trade

835791 basically it says if it looks like a duck and walks like a duck its probably a duck it didnt precisely define what a duck is however so theres always a chance someone will look at the duck and say its a goose
835792 does the local government control the economic development corporation or does the corporation have the authority to bind government
835793 very clearly there needs to be a measure of transparency when government funds are being allocated for economic development
835794 but if we cant hold confidential what a corporations plans are regarding future development were dead in the water no way you can compete in that arena if youre a leaky ship

835804 what would the world be like if this were true
835805 vpn tunnels through firewalls came about because the security folks failed to recognize that if they did not provide what was perceived as required business functionality the business would find a way to do so in spite of them
835806 your solution that you mention where people are responsible for the security of what they manage is not a bad idea on the surface but what skills do these people have in managing security
835807 boy i sure hate all those annoying user account control popups in vista
835808 this is the worst feature ever and i already disabled it and will never re enable it

835844 en el mundo de hoy en d a la distancia s bitamente comenz a valer mucho pero mucho dinero
835845 el considerablemente dram tico cambio en el costo del barril de petr leo y el subsiguiente efecto domin que estamos viendo nos han llevado a revaluar una serie de cosas
835846 en lo que concierne a la manufactura estos precios han fortalecido la noci n de que es mejor construir donde vendes lo que estamos en rgicamente tratando de hacer es garantizar que en todos los mercados emergentes podamos expandir nuestra posibilidad de conseguir el suministro de los productos localmente

835849 durante los dos shocks petroleros de la opep el grueso de las importaciones no petroleras disminuy en seis puntos porcentuales pero las importaciones provenientes de am rica latina y del caribe aumentaron en seis puntos porcentuales lo que nos indica que no todo va a provenir de la industria maquiladora mexicana

835862 in large part on the untested belief of a few high ranking leaders in washington that torture is an effective tool for eliciting valuable information

835864 it was the camelot of counterterrorism one officer later told a journalist
835865 and let me be clear both of those responses are equally horrifying in the instances of individuals who suffered long term psychological consequences as a result of having committed or witnessed torture the government is implicated in that mental harm

835873 nterdapat terjemahan ayat serta ulasan singkat unsur unsur yang terkandung dalam surat al fatihah
835874 berarti saya memulai membaca al fatihah ini dengan menyebut nama alloh seperti makan minum menyembelih binatang untuk dimakan dan sebagainya
835875 beriman kepada tuhan yang maha esa terdapat dalam ayat 2 dimana dinyatakan dengan tegas bahwa segala puji dan ucapan syukur atas sesuatu nimat itu bagi alloh karena alloh adalah pencipta dan sumber segala ni at yang terdapat dalam alam ini
835876 ndiantara nimat itu ialah nimat menciptakan nimat mendidik dan menumbuhkan sebab kata
835877 pendidikan penjagaan dan penumbuhan oleh alloh di alam ini haruslah diperhatikan dan dipikirkan oleh manusia sedalam dalamnya sehingga menjadi sumber berbagai macam ilmu pengetahuan yang dapat menambah keyakinan manusia kepada keagungan dan kemuliaan alloh serta berguna bagi masyarakat
835878 oleh karena keimanan ketauhidan itu merupakan masalah yang pokok maka di dalam surat al fatihah tidak cukup dinyatakan dengan isyarat saja tetapi ditegaskan dan dilengkapi oleh ayat 5 yaitu

835904 so far were not seeing any evidence that they have had any measurable impact
835905 in almost every group in every state especially among independent voters and men
835906 i say that it was very clear that a decision had to be made and i made it when it wasnt popular he made a decision which was popular with his base and that is a fundamental difference
835907 im not prepared to see the sacrifice of so many brave young americans lost because senator obama just views this war as another political issue with which he can change positions
835908 made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
835909 seems the pentagon wouldnt allow him to bring cameras john mccain is always there for our troops mccain country first

835915 in the violence in iraq overall right so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

835924 none of the sunni militias support the maliki government anymore now than they did 5 years ago or they will 5 years from now
835925 smithington you didnt answer the question let me ask it again how did you come by your intimate knowledge of sunni militias in other words on what do you base your judgment
835926 in spite of all that all the factions know that they are stronger together than apart
835927 whatever they decide it is not a defeat for our troops and you are the only person i have ever heard suggesting that it is i wonder where you get that idea

835931 john mccain is still in striking distance thanks to his own character biography and memories of the mccain of previous election cycles but he cannot afford another week like this one
835932 if i had been told by the pentagon that i couldnt visit those troops and i was there and wanted to be there i guarantee you there would have been a seismic event
835933 what i thought was useful was to give the american people some sense of how i was approaching these issues but also to give them a sense that the world can be responsive to this approach and that it will make a difference

835961 in the opening ceremonies you have a lot of prescribed music the olympic hymn has to be sung and the national anthem of the host country
835962 the opening ceremonies are more of ritual and the closing ceremonies are more of a going away party for the athletes you will see more popular music that the athletes can relate to

835977 no one will notice so why bother well we did notice at a steep cost of ownership i really doubt that you got your money back when you pump motor failed again and again this evaluation eliminated whirlpool and its derivatives great door hinge no pump filter flimsy chassis lg terrible door hinge design but at least it has a pump filter now samsung so so door hinge and it also finally has a pump filter chassis is too flimsy the complaint go on and on the darn bubble switches also kept turning up i wanted to avoid these things from manufacturing experience i work in a plant and they fail all the time what i bought this lead me to but one unit on the market that even puts fourth a twenty year expected life like the maytag s of years ago miele the bosch nexxt units were interesting with good door hinges and a pretty solid chassis if i had to make a decision on a second place unit it would have been the bosch washer not the dryer more on that later the bosch had more positives than negatives but i did not want any negatives after looking at the miele washers it was clear who the leader is and who wants to be the leader the miele is built like fort knox strong door no film switches advertised twenty year life objective easy easy easy to use quiet 4 cubic foot capacity chassis sits plenty high enough to forget about the silly stands what is with those stands they cost about 25 bucks to make and you are charged 150 00 to 300 00 for them and the vendor expects me to not look at them with anything but a jaded eye we all know a rip off when we see it i do not like to be sucker punched with outlandish prices on simple pieces of merchandise because the vendor tries to design the unit so you have to have the stands at a got you price my wife is five foot so this is not an issue with her and if i can bend over to get soap out of the so called utility drawer right on the floor i can easily load laundry into the washer two feet above that call me stupid but i put the detergent at eye level on the shelf in the laundry room so i do not lean over far at all how low does the manufacturer expect you to go well all the way to the floor for detergent i guess i refuse to bend over that far every laundry day for them here is the list of features from the miele w4840 web site remember that the trick is to get the advantages of a front loader that still work twenty years from now not just ten or fifteen super large capacity 4 00 ft capacity iec equivalent stainless steel honeycomb washing drum angled control panel touchtronic controls display function 6 pre set wash programs 1 custom wash program 11 mastercare wash programs delay start option 6 heat settings 6 spin settings 0 1400 rpm extended wash program heavy soil program sensitive program program sequence lights fault indicators child lock feature buzzer on off self diagnostics 5 year warranty pc update function 110 volts older units were 220 volt not anymore i figured that the w4800 was more than fine feature wise but the dealer carried the w4840 ok i bargained to a price halfway between the two units this more or less matched the internet pricing and included delivery and installation on top of it with that i go will with the dealer i even went back to the same store that i bought the maytag s from twenty five years ago how it works the w4840 front loading washer is a beauty to behold after looking at all the gussied up emotionally driven products on the market this unit is unabashedly solid in construction and function the owner s manual is probably only thirty pamphlet sized pages owing to the extremely intuitive control functions the control switches are sealed micro switches which are about as good as switches can get the control functions are right on the front edge of the unit so they are easy to get and a laundry basket placed on top of the unit do not block them from view the door is super solid and double bubble glass not plastic on the exterior the stainless wash drum should last awhile and the honeycomb drain design should be easy on clothes getting this unit going is a cinch the first thing you notice is how quiet it is it is so quiet that you can hear the ten to twelve kilohertz clock frequency emanating off of the circuit board remember the oscillator squeal of off a tv the sound and pitch that most nobody can hear well the w4840 runs so quiet on the wash cycle and if you have good hearing you can hear the oscillator frequency the spin cycle is a more realistic max speed of 1 400 rpm i doubt that the chassis on the cheaper washers will withstand the 1 600rpm they tout for too long like maybe ten years its good press but a bad design our unit sits on a concrete floor so it sits there and spins away it shakes less than our maytag washer does at 400rpm clothes come out very dry like a good front loader should your dryer is loafing along to dry what ever leaves the washer the normal wash cycle is 60 minutes there is a setting per programmed for a quick express wash for lightly soiled items plus more settings under mastercare than you ll ever probably use to run this thing through the ringer so to speak i washed a queen sized comforter under the comforter setting well why pick anything else the poor old maytag washer with the agitator clumped up the insulation in the comforter into hard balls we were going to toss it figuring it was trashed imagine my surprise when it came out like brand new out of the dryer i attribute this to two thing the tumbling action of the washer redistributed the fiber fill insulation and the dryer was a 7 0 cubic foot size letting the comforter tumble like it is supposed to in a tumble dryer ok that was easy to figure out sorry but in the smaller maytag dryer it was just sort of stuck in the middle of the dryer so the clumped up fiberfill stayed clumped up so even if the filler was bad out of the maytag washer the dryer did not offer any help the miele on the other hand redistributed the filler and the dryer kept it evenly distributed so it dried faster and you could even use it again like who would have thunk it the next item is pet hair yes we have cat and a dog both are sized perfectly to put in the washer ok we thought about it but decided on just washing their bedding the smaller holes used in the honeycomb design that is sure to be better on clothes traps pet hair before it gets to the pump motor filter i figure that this is probably better than worse in that it does not clog the unit you could argue this either way a quick swipe around the drum with a damp cloth picks up what remains in the drum and the dryer pick off the rest truthfully we ll use the normal button and hit start 99 of the time i like to sound complicated at times but i am not i can not say enough good things about the quality of this washer you will forget the price you pay immediately after you use it and the price is less than a typical home pc i had to realign my price point with the maytag s of years ago to today before i understood a quality washer and dryer is going to run about 2 500 00 for a twenty year or more life unit so the price is right in line with 1983 but the product s are much better one last point since the washer is so good the dryer does not have to make up for clothes saturated with water that take an hour or more to dry the w4840 will prepare clothes going into the dryer that will dry in thirty minutes you will have them folded and put away when the next load comes out of the washer so it is real efficient to run loads one after the other and with so little water you can run five loads to one compared to a top loader great if you have a septic system and more than a few loads you want to run in a given day i paid 1 999 00 for my w4840 unit and it s worth every penny since they will not go into the pump motor i did not buy the miele dryer though the clothes do not know who their mommy and daddy are so i bough a different dryer speed queen commercial aes17aw this 7 0 cubic foot dryer is super rugged and efficient it looks like my old maytag dryer too so i backed away from a too costly and unnecessarily complex dryer and went with rugged utility it has electronic dryer control and three fabric settings i use maybe two on the maytag in twenty five years so we cut the dryer cost to less than 450 00 allowing us to budget a far superior washer this is how we kept the price under 2 600 00 read my review of the dryer elsewhere there are two good models of this excellent dryer to select from depending on how you use them don t get too much in a stitch to match washers and dryers if you shop for the best value and performance w4840 miele touchtronic super large capacity front load washer white miele w4000 series w4840 27

836028 one of the unappreciated casualties of the war of 1861 erroneously called a civil war was its contribution to the erosion of constitutional guarantees of state sovereignty it settled the issue of secession making it possible for the federal government to increasingly run roughshod over ninth and 10th amendment guarantees a civil war by the way is a struggle where two or more parties try to take over the central government confederate president jefferson davis no more wanted to take over washington d c than george washington wanted to take over london both wars are more properly described as wars of independence federal usurpation goes beyond anything the constitutions framers would have imagined james madison explaining the constitution in federalist paper 45 said the powers delegated to the federal government are few and defined those which are to remain in the state governments are numerous and indefinite the former will be exercised principally on external objects such as war peace negotiation and foreign commerce the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects which in the ordinary course of affairs concern the lives liberties and properties of the people thomas jefferson emphasized that the states are not subordinate to the national government but rather the two are coordinate departments of one simple and integral whole one of the more disgusting sights for me to is to watch a president congressman or federal judge take an oath to uphold and defend the united states constitution when in reality they either hold constitutional principles in contempt or they are ignorant of those principles

836095 the level of job advertisements remains at high levels particularly internet ads and in july the overall rate of decline has slowed

836163 piracy is the way to get established and get your name out theres no way to stop it so were using it to our advantage
836164 its this really gritty tacky sleazy jungle music its just genius
836165 its making it possible for every kid in brazil to know their songs by the time they turn five
836166 its actually good for a lot of money you give it away and it will come back thats literally true with information not with property
836167 this year the multinational record labels will only release about 40 records by brazilian artists while tecnobrega artists will release around 400
836168 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
836169 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists
836170 before you couldnt get your record played on the radio if you couldnt afford payola now if a song hits big with the aparelhagens the radio has no choice but to play it
836171 in fact software development methodologies are one of the biggest delusions of all they help keep
836172 isnt software development programming engineering getting easier to easy i think that is the problem i mean with the rad tools and java java derived languages that came out of the 90s everyone can be a coder now
836173 its completely aesthetically satisfying there were times i would sit at a game with the old knicks and think to myself in the fourth quarter this is everything the theater should be and isnt
836174 you see life consists of giving yourself these problems that can be dealt with so you dont have to face the problems that cant be dealt with its very meaningful to me for instance to see if the knicks are going to get over some problem or another these are matters you can get involved with safely and pleasurably and the outcome doesnt hurt you

836177 our contradictory words and actions have alienated virtually the entire arab world nato remains fractured and largely ineffectual against the resurgent taliban and the washington clock has run out on the iraq war we have elevated al qaedas importance to nearly our own and we are moving into a deadly where america is neither respected nor feared it is almost inconceivable and yet it has come to this we are losing the global influence war to people who blow up women and children at kebab stands
836178 arab media reported on sunday that a brigadier general thought to be the syrian regimes liaison with hezbollah in lebanon has been assassinated the reports came almost six months after the killing in a damascus car bomb of top hezbollah military commander imad mughnieh which the shiite militant group blamed on israel
836179 take the next obama to tel aviv show him its vivid night life and arrange for him to meet with writers scientists and intellectuals show him the iscar plant and take him to a performance by the batsheva dance troupe this will be far more impressive than any piece of rusting qassam take him to a concert a show an exhibit an israeli movie most of all lets refrain from voices of angst both ours and his enough with sobbing in this country already

836182 norton deserves praise for writing an insightful and multilayered work accessible to a wide
836183 this short authoritative book based on first hand experience efficiently analyses hezbollahs status
836184 a cogent analysis of hezbollahs emergence and impact on lebanese politics
836185 a good concise survey by a perceptive student of the lebanese shia
836186 nortons timely hezbollah chronicles that dramatic evolution and its sweeping implications for the region and beyond
836187 everyone who wants to understand the complexities of the middle east
836188 he ends on a tentative note voicing hope that hezbollah will play a
836189 short personal anecdotes from his time in lebanon add both color and authority to the book
836190 an excellent summary that ends with a dramatic question what next
836191 in an easily read easily comprehended book norton traces the origins and history of hezbollah
836192 the many complex and often changing dimensions of hezbollah are presented in the book in a clear concise manner
836193 there is no better person to address these questions than norton who has been studying lebanon and especially the lebanese shiites for longer than hezbollah has been in existence
836194 by the last year of the bush presidency growing numbers of former administration insiders had abandoned the government with the conviction that in waging the war against terrorism america had lost its way many had fought valiantly to right what they saw as a dangerously wrong turn with bush cheney and addington still firmly in power it was hard to declare their efforts a success still with change in the air there was a sense that history might be on their side jack goldsmith the assistant attorney general who objected to the justice department memo allowing torture moved to boston to teach law at harvard where he was ironically greeted with protests because of his association with the bush administrations policies matthew waxman who as deputy assistant secretary of defense fought unsuccessfully to uphold the geneva conventions moved to new york where he too began to teach law in his case at columbia alberto mora as general counsel of the us navy had campaigned within the pentagon to end the coercive methods used at guant namo he left the administration as a pariah in the eyes of some pentagon colleagues but was given the john f kennedy foundations profiles in courage award in 2006 for speaking out most of the fbi agents who opposed enhanced interrogation techniques retired and joined private secur

836197 egypts ministry of interior said it took the action because the station did not have a broadcasting licence but it is widely believed that the cause was a documentary about the assassination of anwar sadat egypts late president that said he was killed for signing a peace agreement with israel
836198 the rift wont be bridged unless this silly film is burnt
836199 the bells line of expressway remains the first priority of the mayors of central nsw
836200 i applaud the marrangaroo to bell option being included in the study for the best way to connect central nsw with the blue mountains and then to sydney
836201 we believe that this option is financially feasible though the longer we leave the expenditure on this essential piece of nationally significant infrastructure the more expensive it will become
836202 central new south wales councils centroc represents 17 local government bodies across the region and we are unanimous in our support of the bells line of expressway
836203 and its a collection not an exhibition so its all for sale
836204 it also provides an opportunity for local businesses volunteers and potential sponsors to get behind it and contribute to making the community a better one for our children
836205 we will be negotiating over the next couple of months
836206 we are investigating to see which one is more appropriate
836207 the contractor was working on a project unrelated to mobilys business and had been briefed of the cables location through maps diagrams and a series of meetings
836208 for our enterprise customers maintaining continuous availability of email access is a critical requirement with this new service etisalat now offers our customers a powerful and robust solution to protect critical parts of our customers it infrastructure we selected neverfail as our preferred provider behind our high availability and disaster recovery services for mobile email systems on the basis of its enviable reputation for protecting mission critical systems
836209 we are expected to be profitable by the last quarter of this year itself much before the promised horizon
836210 when we found out that we only had a few weeks with him we tried to do absolutely everything with him that we could him and ellie had been special friends for a couple of years but then they broke up we said wed have a pirate party and ellie came she went to visit reece a few times in hospital as well
836211 he was so proud of her and we were proud of them both
836212 the fourth largest generic firm in the u s for 7 46 billion
836213 ivax in january 2006 for 7 4 billion and sicor in october 2003 for 3 4 billion
836214 generic powerhouse employing about 37 000 people globally and operating directly in more than 60 countries
836215 managing and following up on the cell for the production of biological weapons such as anthrax and others
836216 the problem is not that some costs will rise but that at the moment there is no discussion of the need to compensate the state and territory governments
836217 nearly one and a half billion dollars per year could employ more than 15 000 teachers or nurses
836218 the commonwealth has said that it will compensate households and polluters but it looks to us as though the state governments have got a much stronger case for compensation than the big emitters
836219 it is known that keli lane frequented this house prior to the birth of tegan and we believe that she visited there shortly after departing auburn hospital
836220 this has been an ongoing inquiry thats been going on for two years and today we will be conducting a forensic archaeological excavation at premises at gladesville searching for the remains
836221 it will be reserved for those at the very extreme end of the obesity spectrum
836222 thats what you get for fucking with me square enix
836223 package delivery trucks are not permitted to park along the curb next to a driveway because the exhaust from said package delivery truck is harmful to the homeowners tomato plants and totally makes the homeowners wife angry
836224 as part of the compensation package were providing them the commonwealth with the likely impacts
836225 you might well say that its in my interests if you like to put demands on peter costello or otherwise
836226 peter costello in my view has earned the right to make a decision in his interests and that of his family and the electors of higgins in due course and announce it when hes ready to do so
836227 i would be very happy if peter costello makes the decision to stay and he obviously would come straight on to our frontbench
836228 i respect him i respect his wife tanya and their family theyve worked damned hard for this country
836229 its not until you walk in somebody elses shoes you get a feel for what they put up with the gruelling year in year out hard decisions and work that he put in sacrifices by his family to get us into the position we were in in november last year before mr rudd took control of things
836230 as far as im concerned peter costello has made us a better country hes earned the right to make a decision when it suits him
836231 obviously i wouldnt be human if i didnt say that there are some times when you wonder what is on the mind of some people and of course your family read the papers and hear these things
836232 we also have assisted the veterinary clinic move part of its clinic to new premises so that the business may continue
836233 businesses that have the courage to put their hand up and say ive got this disease shouldnt be left out to dry as a result of the quarantine
836234 there are 23 jobs on the line they have got two of their staff still in hospital that is very distressing for the highly respected owner of the business
836235 we know older homeless people arent accessing mainstream services in their true numbers
836236 thats because they believe mostly correctly that existing homeless services dont address their complex needs
836237 another common reason is because they feel too proud or independent to use them
836238 so their numbers and the scale of the problem are going undetected
836239 if older homeless people are slipping under the radar of traditional homeless services then its fair to say their presence is registering as zero with the wider community
836240 police gave initial medical assistance at the scene and three men the driver and passenger from the sedan and the driver from the second vehicle were taken to mackay base hospital
836241 the man driving the sedan is in a critical condition the other two are listed as stable
836242 i would say hey you know youre just three years old

836251 a shared responsibility between employers workers insurers providers and government all americans should have coverage they can afford
836252 theres no real consensus yet on which is the best health care reform to do other than we are committed to universality and were committed to getting there
836253 we believe that as you make health care more affordable people will be able to buy health care thats the basic principle how we get there is a matter of the legislative process
836254 way way back in first grade sister mary alacquoe was answering the questions of a classmate who told how every wednesday afternoon he answered the door and their was a very polite lady from jehovahs witnesses
836255 its a sluggish economy and its difficulties are felt all over

836262 surely we should be doing as much to prevent the spread of the aids virus in our own communities as we are trying to do abroad
836263 we have no evidence to suggest there are problems within qantas but we think its prudent and wise to go in with a new special team and take an additional look at a range of operational issues within qantas
836264 we have confirmation now that 145 people have been killed
836265 we found eight to 10 stones which had fallen off and probably scared the people causing the stampede
836266 we discussed with the patient that he would have to deal with the fact that his hands were from somebody else
836267 would you like to stop at emerys and go blueberry picking

836270 i feel like my old self again neurotic paranoid totally inadequate completely insecure its a pleasure
836271 it was my fate to survive while others perhaps with a greater gift and stronger than i have perished
836272 we intend to get into the power station to do whatever we can to stop it operating that day we want to send a very strong message to say new coal is absolute madness and we simply wont allow it
836273 our main concerns are that coal fired powered stations are worse in terms of co2 production even than oil or gas fired power stations
836274 it would symbolically be very unfortunate if the uk were to approve a coal fired power station without imposing very strict requirements that some technology should be adopted that would allow it to capture the carbon dioxide it emits
836275 the 43 was the first car to call at the pits to take on grooved tyres team manager christian schumacher told us which gave us quite an advantage thomas went out determined to do battle just behind st phane daoudi whose ferrari was still shod with slicks a major crash between two aston martins then occurred and the race was neutralised right through to the finish outcome obviously the ferrari never swapped tyres she came in during the following lap and even though strategically we held the advantage she came out on top having said that a 2nd place as from the cars 3rd race is pretty brilliant
836276 christian promptly went off to see the clerk of the course martin bartek told us but in the time allocate was unable to explain to them that in fact the driver change had taken place during the second pitstop and not the first one as erroneously indicated on the monitors so in fact i inherited a stop amp go and talking about a stop amp go this was a complete stop which lasted a full minute absolute hell
836277 bentleys proud sporting pedigree forged by the exploits of the immortal bentley boys on the famous brooklands racetrack in the 1920s was the inspiration for our new coup capturing all the style power and splendour of that era
836278 to create a powerful muscular and rakish grand touring coup with classic british proportions in the finest bentley tradition
836279 the brooklands beautiful flowing lines are testament to the traditional coach building skills and craftsmanship of crewes highly talented workforce

836285 its for them that we do this and to receive such tremendous support from them is amazing and it is very much appreciated by everyone on the department i hope they know that

836287 ive made the decision to stand down as england captain
836288 its the hardest decision ive ever had to make but also the easiest
836289 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
836290 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
836291 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
836292 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time
836293 i will take a break from the game so i wont be playing at the oval
836294 i just want to try and freshen up the mind and get back to playing as a batsman i do believe these could be the best years of my playing career
836295 thats the one thing i want to get back doing
836296 in new zealand i had a few thoughts that i might go
836297 it is a fairytale to captain your country but it hasnt had a fairytale ending i know that it is the right time because my mind told me it was my body is working well but my mind is not
836298 i wish whoever gets the job all the luck in the world its a great privilege
836299 michael led from the front and led with honesty and integrity every step of the way
836300 he took the england captaincy to new heights michael was the best possible ambassador for the game and his record as captain speaks volumes for the character he instilled in the dressing room
836301 paul feels this is the best decision in terms of benefiting the england team and his contribution to the team
836302 we are extremely grateful for way paul led the one day side since last year
836303 the selection committee is currently considering the squad and captain for the fourth test and natwest series these squads along with the captain will be announced tomorrow monday
836304 ive made the decision to step down as englands one day captain as i want to give myself the best chance to perform for england and enjoy my cricket
836305 whilst i am humbled to have been given the opportunity to captain englands one day side i feel the captaincy diminished my ability to perform for england across all forms of the game
836306 i feel the england captaincy impacted on my ability to enjoy my cricket and contribute to the team
836307 ive always enjoyed representing my country at the highest level and it has always been my ambition to play cricket across all forms of the game but ive found the extra workload of the captaincy to be very difficult
836308 the last thing i want is for the captaincy to impact my performance and that of the team which is why ive arrived at this decision after a huge amount of consideration
836309 i will continue to make myself available to england for all forms of cricket and look forward to playing a significant role in englands future success
836310 i always get fat when i try to build mass
836311 obviously to put on lean body mass you have to stimulate the body to do so through high intensity weight training
836312 you tend to stay fuller longer and may have less of a tendency to eat
836313 sure the body needs protein to grow but much of that protein is often wasted if total caloric intake falls too low
836314 more work less calories match your daily caloric intake to your expenditure and include some aerobic work along with your weight training to get your body to use fat as fuel
836315 its possible to rearrange and be losing fat while adding lean body mass which would result in no net change on the scale

836351 to tackle the teacher shortage and attract and retain quality teachers we need to offer rewarding salary and career structures
836352 establishing a national assessment and classification structure for accomplished teachers is possible based on standards and criteria already being used in various ways across the states
836353 currently there are few options for such teachers other than to move into leadership and administrative roles which take them and their teaching abilities out of the classroom where they are most needed
836354 this proposal from the profession is timely as coag the council of australian governments is developing its national partnership on teacher quality

836367 if that was a legal treatment we would have done it at the time
836368 advertising expenses were set up as an operating expense they were pulled from the general ledger and made to disappear
836369 if a proper accounting basis existed in 1994 you didnt know about it and gordon eckstein livents former senior vice president of finance and administration didnt tell you about it
836370 im going to suggest to you that by obtaining replacement invoices and not submitting them to ms young you were effectively sidestepping this control mechanism a control mechanism put in place by mr drabinsky
836371 i cant say he put it in place but it certainly is a normal control mechanism yes
836372 you say that 1996 was the starting point of your understanding with mr wilner about his cooperation on the invoices
836373 so it follows as day follows night that there should only be original invoices from ledonne before that time correct
836374 i suggest to you that when you gave your evidence you slandered mr wilner
836375 you suggested he was the one who permitted some kind of facility here im suggesting to you that before you met with him you created some kind of facility yourself
836376 this is typical of mr eckstein and his insane risk taking
836377 nobody suggested there was no element of risk in any of this
836378 we were very impressed with their financial dictionary of 5 300 terms

836386 she looked like she really didnt want to discuss it
836387 the nature of peoples personalities like gords were intimidating and abusive
836388 eckstein swore at me he called me an idiot and sometimes embarrassed me in front of vendors
836389 did you have any idea that mr wittlan before he became your lawyer acted for just about everybody
836390 no this is the first time im hearing about that

836408 i said do you want me to lie to new management
836409 he didnt answer he smirked looked away and basically that ended the conversation
836410 gord told me to send the schedule up to myron and let myron handle it
836411 she is from the auditing firm and we have been lying to her
836412 eckstein said that because she was from the auditing firm it would be too black and white keep her out of it once she is hooked we would slowly let her in
836413 messina said oh my god oh my god oh my god she was clearly distressed
836414 garth ran the company there was very little that happened without his knowledge or approval
836415 im very concerned about the way this is coming out the questions are being put to her in a way that we are getting hearsay double hearsay triple hearsay
836416 mr drabinsky asked very intuitive questions and caught some mistakes that had been made
836417 it was a number we had moved i think it was from for the pantages south development for which there was very little backup
836418 have a problem with what we were doing with the numbers
836419 dont worry about that she wont be involved with that
836420 gord eckstein said that garth wanted them out of there in two weeks no one was going to tell him how to run his company
836421 when gord was satisfied with the numbers hed prepare management statements and review them with the executives and then eventually hed come back to us with certain adjustments that were required
836422 you knew that just having a schedule referring to transfers doesnt indicate to mr gerry blair that there was a fraud going on at livent
836423 he never referred to them as fraud but he did have a way of characterizing them
836424 how many times is mr gottliebs name on the list
836425 i seem to be losing control of my cross examination
836426 you knew there could be proper allocation of costs between shows
836427 as i said it was meant to be an ambiguous term
836428 its reasonable to conclude a perfectionist with 10 or more shows running at any time has got a pretty full day with respect to the actual production side of the business
836429 mr eckstein had 100 of his time to deal with accounting issues but mr drabinsky was a personal and hands on producer of livents shows
836430 but at the time these were costs that legitimately belonged to the productions listed and in fact they were inappropriately adjusted
836431 the reader would not be aware of any financial irregularities the footnote does not say these were all baseless and arbitrary
836432 im going to suggest to you that your testimony makes zero sense
836433 that may well be but im just telling you what happened at the time
836434 when you reported to mr drabinsky you didnt say anything about problems with the transfers you just say here are the numbers
836435 isnt it apparent from this document that new management were going to be in control not just for the second quarter but the first quarter as well
836436 thats all well and good but my context is my context
836437 whether or not the invoice is dated in 1994 or not the dates for the ads clearly shows that they ran in 1994 the auditors are going to say this isnt a 1995 expense its a 1994 expense
836438 unless they took the position that based on the matching principle it could be a 1995 expense
836439 we made enough progress on most of the major issues to give the negotiators confidence to continue talking through the night without a strike

836443 you cannot be president of the school board and advocate for charter schools every child deserves an equal chance and all parents cannot afford to send their children out of the district
836444 while i can support charter schools within the context of the public school system i believe that public dollars should stay in public schools
836445 i believe that more money must be put into special education adult education and vocational education programs to ensure that every student can learn to the maximum of her his potential
836446 detroiters are sitting on the rooftops like the pitiful katrina victims waiting for a rescue boat to float by

836449 that presence is going to help other people get better because theyre not going to want to pitch to manny especially with men on base so it figures that the guys at the top of the lineup are going to get better pitches to hit
836450 i really appreciate manny being here but i dont think hes our savior
836451 everybody wants him to be and man i hope he is but we still have to pitch and we still have to play now that were going to play with him hell make us better and well make him better
836452 i mean he hit 70 home runs in one year mannys not going to do that hopefully itll just be easier for us to score runs than before when it was such a nail puling issue for us
836453 they gave me a lot of good pitches to hit and i drove it
836454 im still nervous out there but im going to play hard no matter what
836455 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
836456 that just puts it in perspective there is a lot of excitement going on right now with the fans
836457 i didnt have control and when i got it in the zone they hit it hard
836458 i didnt do my job today but ill go out there again in five days and do my job
836459 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
836460 i know he wasnt feeling good but this was unexpected
836461 the scope for monetary policy to be supportive of financial stability appears to be more constrained than before amid high and volatile commodity prices that have raised inflationary risks
836462 as economies slow credit deterioration is widening and deepening and as banks deleverage and rebuild capital lending is beginning to be squeezed restricting household spending and clouding the outlook for the real economy
836463 at the moment a bottom for the housing market is not visible however some recent developments in affordability may provide support for house prices to stabilize
836464 emerging markets remain relatively resilient to the credit turmoil thus far
836465 however as the crisis remains protracted external funding conditions are tightening and some emerging markets are coming under increased scrutiny especially regarding their policies to address rising inflationary pressures
836466 outflows from em emerging market equity funds have been concentrated on asian markets where inflation and downside growth risks are most elevated
836467 he is trying to make this education debate a democrat vs republican thing when i am concerned about the gross immorality that has taken root in detroit public schools charter schools and even in the home
836468 high school kids are coming into the school to jump on the children and those incidents are not being reported
836469 we dont have security i know things take time but we dont have the time
836470 we have a sixth grade boys class with over 60 students these children are not coming first
836471 in making the rounds this week of the citys dailies the schools chief painted a picture of financial mismanagement that is stunning in its ineptitude corruption and possible criminality its sickening this mess that essentially says the education of 105 000 detroit students is less important to bureaucrats than gaming an inefficient system awash in taxpayer dollars and crying for more
836472 we have violence that causes some schools at times to be virtually out of control this is not conducive for learning
836473 has anyone stopped to ask mr a what happens to the children that will be invariably left in the dps once the charter schools have reduced the district to a shadow of its former self what happens to all of the highly qualified teachers and high standards for qualification what happens to all of the learning disabled children who the charter schools conveniently dont address because it doesnt fit their bottom line what happens to the coordination of standards what happens to jrotc
836474 what happens to all of the highly qualified teachers and high standards for qualification
836475 youd spend this on someone else so spend it on yourself
836476 this storyline gives us the opportunity to explore the emotional challenges and real life decisions facing the parents of a child who has been permanently injured we will go on a heart wrenching journey with our characters as they learn about the current medical options and obstacles facing their child who has become deaf in the tradition of all my childrens hallmark storytelling this is a story of strength love and hope

836481 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
836482 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
836483 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
836484 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
836485 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
836486 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
836487 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we

836497 this isnt exactly life changing and it certainly isnt taco but its alright
836498 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
836499 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
836500 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
836501 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
836502 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
836503 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
836504 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
836505 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
836506 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
836507 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
836508 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
836509 that the human family may know how to respect gods design for the world and thus become ever more aware of the great gift of god which creation represents for us

836511 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
836512 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
836513 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
836514 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
836515 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
836516 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
836517 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
836518 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
836519 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
836520 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
836521 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
836522 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
836523 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
836524 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
836525 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
836526 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
836527 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
836528 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
836529 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
836530 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
836531 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
836532 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
836533 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
836534 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
836535 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
836536 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
836537 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
836538 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
836539 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
836540 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
836541 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
836542 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
836543 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
836544 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
836545 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
836546 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
836547 who are open to doing something on the production side
836548 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
836549 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
836550 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
836551 alright well were in a country without a leader so for the first few weeks well meet informally under bridges and trees and hopefully by then well have a new leader and we can have a room or i can go get the key
836552 you wouldnt know the difference and thats the beauty of a parliamentary system
836553 looks like your uncle and that should tell you something about his governing style whens the last time your uncle tried to radically change japanese foreign policy
836554 we wont have to hold class meetings under our chairs

836556 that half of the year well well never be friends

836558 i picked the exit that dumps unsuspecting gaijin into the back alleys to be robbed
836559 wonder why its so dark what do people do in here
836560 hello my name is pierre i come from france where do you come from
836561 here he goes with more wacked out pictures about how crazy the japanese think america is and then hell imply that its our fault because of the image we project
836562 the most beautiful girl that i have ever seen with a kebab
836563 why not mega kebab its here its reasonably priced and its a restaurant called the freaking mega kebab
836564 sorry give it your all bye bye at my back
836565 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
836566 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
836567 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
836568 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
836569 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
836570 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
836571 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
836572 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
836573 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
836574 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
836575 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
836576 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
836577 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
836578 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
836579 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
836580 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
836581 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
836582 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
836583 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
836584 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
836585 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
836586 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
836587 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
836588 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
836589 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
836590 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

836605 what another leader in sovereign grace ministries teaches about courtship amp dating
836606 one factor that you have to take into consideration immediately when
836607 ive never claimed that the ideas i share in it are for everyone
836608 what problems joshua harris acknowledged about how singles relate at his church but doesnt share on his website
836609 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
836610 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
836611 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
836612 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
836613 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
836614 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
836615 yourselvess schoolable humourous a factual acme pertaining to your post marchen and pour balm into manages against touch poetic justice hypochondriac toward the monolithic roots about humane relationships
836616 sovereign grace encourages church involvement and oversight in matters of courtship the entire church gets involved
836617 sadly there have been many times that people have applied its principles in a very legalistic and heavy handed way some people have had my book forced on them or have been treated as though agreeing with me is the only option for christians if youre one of those people i apologize that certainly wasnt my intention when i wrote it

836619 man would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him
836620 separated from god because of the hardening of their hearts
836621 if god sovereignly decides who he will save and that all others have no chance at salvation i wonder why god would call all men to repent acts 17 30
836622 all that the father gives me will come to me
836623 men seek seclusion in the wilderness by the seashore or in the mountains a dream you have cherished only to fondly yourself nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul above all he who possesses resources in himself which he need only contemplate in secure immediate ease of mind the ease that is but another word for a well ordered spirit avail yourself often then of this retirement and so continually renew yourself make your rules of life brief yet so as to embrace the fundamentals recurrence to them will then suffice to remove all vexation and send you back without fretting to the duties to which you must return

836637 the key is to try to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
836638 since california constitutes 25 percent of the housing stock in the u s any stabilization can have a profound impact on national averages
836639 by extension a stabilization in home prices is required before any sustainable rally in financials can be expected
836640 it is our belief that we are moving in that direction
836641 we think a temporary bottom in housing is at hand
836642 at last the carrying cost of purchasing a home equals rental rates a condition that should lead to more stable home pricing going forward
836643 and they sent him back they say we must prepare for a trip into the woods
836644 aye given our situation they agreed to make the bulk of the preparations here he is our wits must be about us
836645 i know not how far thy knowledge goes but we have some information of interest regarding thy mysterious informant
836646 he hath not been seen since the taverner of this establishment espied him the morn of yesterday
836647 not to mention that he may know his final target already
836648 i increased guards on both archbishop and conrad in case of attack i fear we are no closer to finding man before but we are ready if thou hast ideas they are welcome
836649 beast very much my concern i hunt him for long time
836650 indeed sir he followeth us to every town he hath no lair eats little and must never sleep i set many traps for him but he is cunning and escapes them he must be demon or evil spirit he drives people to confess sin but that best done out of love not fear
836651 i think gentlemen not tell me all no is fine we keep secrets for later
836652 i am sorry to depart i must hunt man of many faces time may be short we talk again later no
836653 i have the distinct impression my friend that we hath been weighed in the scales
836654 otherwise he would have not told us so much but he leaves much unsaid does he know what we do
836655 one more puzzle to add to an already tall stack but quickly let us join our companions
836656 nay nay these are not for thee rapscallions so any items of especial note in this assemblage
836657 most is by the good grace of the archbishop but i stopped by myriams cottage the midwife wants to get rid of the soldiers apparently they just sit around and eat but i told her that the beast is becoming bolder despite this she says she prays even more for my own safety she provided me with these garlands of aconite to ward off all manner of lycanthropic menaces
836658 i visited the hut of cyon and picked up some of this anti wolf balm guaranteed to frighten off all manner of beasts
836659 i believe myriam mentioned this concoction she says the chief ingredient thereof is the dung of hares
836660 i have also gathered a goodly amount of salted beef cheese hardtack and wine
836661 perhaps if we have to coat ourselves in this substance more wine might be necessary
836662 though we have made haste i fear we are too late to find this place in the woods and be back before nightfall should we wait for the morrow
836663 though some special dispensation for the sake of necessity might be obtained

836679 the guys to my left and right dont deserve anything to happen to them because of my personal pride
836680 hes going to have one hell of a time understanding what people say if he cant get visual cues
836681 limits his ability to identify enemy locations by sound hear commands from his team leaders hear radio traffic over a squad radio or speak with local nationals in combat which could have negative ramifications to the mission
836682 hearing loss is present in all forms in the army
836683 its impossible to validate whether he will lose his hearing more or less in the future i feel that infantry is his best place
836684 thats kevin wanting to lead his men and do the right thing
836685 wants to stay infantry this is his life i vote he stays infantry
836686 i came to terms with myself and realized that i was not as confident in my ability to continue my job
836687 it was better for me to realize this than to ignore it
836688 i dont know how to approach commanders and tell them of what my feelings are
836689 because ive been around long enough to know that ill be looked at as a quitter
836690 we see cases of soldiers deploying when they did not meet the hearing standards
836691 the commander has to make the call based on the mission but the doctors should make the case very clearly that deploying cpl x against his or her medical judgment is a decision that could be held against the commander
836692 this is a disability you dont want to get worse
836693 you dont want this person to be put in a position where he might hurt himself or others
836694 they say my symptoms are mimicking signs of depression who the hell knows what that means
836695 they gave me three sheets of paper with breathing techniques another describing how to imagine being in a happy place and to remind myself to relax when i started getting anxious
836696 for them to tell me to think happy thoughts is what will resolve my issues immediately i have no faith in their judgment
836697 staff sgt dunne attested that he could fulfill his duties
836698 dunne relayed that he did not want to let down his soldiers so he did not report his condition
836699 you cant ask the person to make the determination because emotionally theyre too connected to wanting to overcome their disability

836743 all of the questions in recent weeks on whether or not barack obama is shifting positions becoming a typical politician is turning some of them off
836744 the ability to say god in public not having to hide it away in church for an hour each week
836745 despite the presence of hundreds of thousands of young visitors 125 000 of them from overseas there was almost no trouble
836746 in so many of our societies side by side with material prosperity a spiritual desert is spreading an interior emptiness an unnamed fear a quiet sense of despair
836747 our world has grown weary of greed exploitation and division of
836748 from the forlorn child in a darfur camp or a troubled teenager or an anxious parent in any suburb or perhaps even now from the depth of your own heart there emerges the same human cry for recognition for belonging for unity

836755 it is depressing how ignorant people are of how the world works

836758 if incentives and nudges replace requirements and bans government will be both smaller and more modest in short libertarian paternalism is neither left nor right neither democratic nor republican in many areas the most thoughtful democrats are going beyond their enthusiasm for choice eliminating programs in many areas the most thoughtful republicans are abandoning their knee jerk opposition to constructive governmental initiatives
836759 americans are smart enough to figure out whether theyre going to drive less or not
836760 so why would you want to encourage making a massive monopoly to control everything within our government
836761 just recognizing the flaws of mankind is not a justification for paternalism

836766 a very small group of humans possess homozygous mutations for the leptin gene which lead to a constant desire for food resulting in severe obesity
836767 loosely put after youve lost weight you have more of an emotional response to food and less ability to control that response
836768 its only been in recent decades that this mechanism is contributing more to obesity than survival
836769 how do some people manage to overcome the leptin effect and keep weight off

836789 that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
836790 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness
836791 prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed
836792 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
836793 such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government
836794 the history of the present king of great britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states to prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world

836906 youll see our stuff being the first linux on qualcomm

836908 its preventing the participation of many smart developers who want to get involved in the development of the android platform the community comes at the early inception of a product not when you decide youre ready to ship a product
836909 people think publishing the source code is the hard part but the harder thing by far is having open participation in the decision making distributing authority outside your four walls

837325 romance is not here living in a dry desert saudi women are missing something in their lives in the treatment in the family the wife with her husband and the husband with his wife what i see from my female customers is that they are attracted by the love and romance and the way the man is treating the woman
837326 i admire the story of mohannad and noor because of what it shows about how a family should be
837327 the grandfather fikhry is the one who takes care of the whole family decides everything and solves all the problems everyone respects him
837328 i can only watch it because of mohannad he is handsome romantic and takes care of his wife in fact he is better than his wife
837329 i was surprised how children from 6 to 15 years old are buying from me only the potato chips with their pictures on it
837330 i want a romantic man who treats me like how mohannad treats his wife every day he brings her flowers and tells her romantic words
837331 the life will be very good when a husband treats his wife like that
837332 when she has troubles with mohannad she wants to him to leave her alone she wants to work and doesnt want anything from him this means any woman who falls out with her husband can work and depend on herself

837340 when i read this story i see many parallels between the patriotism in china and that in the us virtually every one of the statements in this article could be talking about the american people calling anti war protesters unamerican or lashing out at any foreigner who criticises america

837352 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
837353 in spite of impressive advances in recent years our present understanding of organic aerosol oa composition physical and chemical properties sources and transformation characteristics is still rather limited and their environmental effects remain highly uncertain
837354 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
837355 here we use three lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles that were vertically stacked between 0 5 and 3 km over the polluted indian ocean these unmanned aerial vehicles deployed miniaturized instruments measuring aerosol concentrations soot amount and solar fluxes during 18 flight missions the three unmanned aerial vehicles were flown with a horizontal separation of tens of metres or less and a temporal separation of less than ten seconds which made it possible to measure the atmospheric solar heating rates directly we found that atmospheric brown clouds enhanced lower atmospheric solar heating by about 50 per cent our general circulation model simulations which take into account the recently observed widespread occurrence of vertically extended atmospheric brown clouds over the indian ocean and asia3 suggest that atmospheric brown clouds contribute as much as the recent increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases to regional lower atmospheric warming trends we propose that the combined warming trend of 0 25 k per decade may be sufficient to account for the observed retreat of the himalayan glaciers
837356 the results summarised in table 2 6 and figure 2 13 together with the estimates of nitrate and mineral dust rf combined with the measurement based estimates provide an estimate for the combined aerosol direct rf of 0 50 0 40 w m 2 the progress in both global modelling and measurements of the direct rf of aerosol leads to a medium low level of scientific understanding
837357 the role of nonlinear processes of aerosol dynamics in rf has been recently studied in global aerosol models that account for the internally mixed nature of aerosol particles

837360 opinions expressed are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the aps or of the forum
837361 the models heavily relied upon by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc had not projected this multidecadal stasis in
837362 in this essay however i will argue that humanity faces a much greater danger from the glaciation associated with the next ice age and that the carbon dioxide increases that we have seen during the past two hundred years are not sufficient to avert such glaciation and its associated disruptions to the biosphere and civilization as we know it
837363 thus while an enduring temperature rise of similar magnitude over the next century would cause humanity to face some changes that would undoubtedly be within our spectrum of adaptability we have done so in the past entering a new ice age would be catastrophic for the preservation of modern civilization
837364 the radiative forcing due to co2 may serve as an amplifier of initial orbital forcing which is then further amplified by fast atmospheric feedbacks that are also at work for the present day and future climate
837365 but i will admit once a person like abp starts with the insults we are sure to do likewise
837366 the sites realclimate focus has been exclusively on attacking those who invoke science as the basis for their opposition to action on climate change folks such as george will senator james inhofe michael crichton mcintyre and mckitrick fox news and myron ebell whether intended or not the site has clearly aligned itself squarely with one political position on climate change

837391 could you reply to mr sheppards contention that your arithmetic was flawed concerning temperatures rising in europe due to cleaner air not having an impact on global warming since average temperatures are a collection of data points from around the world if one continents temperatures are rising doesnt this impact the average isnt this basic arithmetic
837392 there is considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
837393 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
837394 now when it comes to agw or climate change or whatever its called most conservatives do not believe that the end of the world is here
837395 most of us are still waiting for science to step in and settle the argument once and for all
837396 so in the meantime we see no reason to scare the hell out of people and we see no need to bankrupt this nation just to satisfy some experts consensus besides the last five years have shown a cooling cycle not a warming one
837397 arithmetic was flawed concerning temperatures rising in europe due to cleaner air not having an impact on global warming
837398 could you reply to mr sheppards contention that your arithmetic was flawed concerning temperatures rising in europe due to cleaner air not having an impact on global warming since average temperatures are a collection of data points from around the world if one continents temperatures are rising doesnt this impact the average isnt this basic arithmetic
837399 eleven of the last twelve years 1995 2006 rank among the warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperaturre since 1850
837400 it is well known that the time scale of commitment depends not only on the climate system response time but also on the atmospheric lifetime of the radiative forcing agent in question gas or aerosol e g see ref 12
837401 the last five years have shown a cooling cycle not a warming one
837402 since science doesnt deal in truth but only likelihood you assert that everything is therefore debatable
837403 but i dont see you querying gravity the heliocentric model the big bang etc and i doubt very much whether your concerns are over the ultimate truth value of science as a whole
837404 you will notice if you spend any time with scientists i recommend it to everyone that they are very particular what they debate over they dont bother with the things like the radiative impact of co2 heliocentricity the roundness of the earth where the evidence is already overwhelming or on questions for which there is no evidence whats the point
837405 coming here with meaningless talking point cliches like the debate is not over is not however useful
837406 next week will be a little quiet it is mid summer after all so apologies in advance if the moderation is a somewhat slow
837407 the thermal inertia of ocean and ice is thus among the key factors that cause lags between increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases and observed atmospheric temperature changes
837408 correction i meant 10 9 10 10 collisons per second
837409 we dont know exactly which geophysical forces are most important for climate change nor which scientific approaches point toward the best explanations some controversies have remained unresolved for decades matters now considered minor as carbon dioxide once was may eventually loom large and vice versa
837410 volcano input is comparable to the background geothermal flux which in turn is much less than the fluxes through the pycnocline from the warm atlantic water and to a lesser extent the pacific inflow
837411 we have primary evidence that heat from the bottom is not reaching the ice temperature profiles from virtually everywhere in the arctic ocean display a maximum temperature at a depth from 200 400 meters this is associated with the atlantic water entering the basin from the norwegian sea fundamental laws of physics require that below the depth of this maximum the heat flux is downward very near the bottom temperatures have been found to increase with depth indicating a small upward heat flux from geothermal sources which help to heat only the very deepest water
837412 the average heat added from volcanoes to the ocean is of order 0 1 watt per square meter but the heat added or removed to the ocean from the sun and atmosphere is of order 100 watt per square meter so it is very hard for volcanoes to compete someone probably has much better estimates than these
837413 well meaning errors can promote confusion about whether humanity is truly causing global warming by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere these issues were satisfactorily addressed by physicists 50 years ago and the necessary physics is included in all climate models
837414 jpr to oversimplify the basic absorption physics to maybe clear the stage
837415 i doubt it they would be trivial in magnitude compared to the heat the oceans absorb from the sun and the atmosphere
837416 well meaning errors can promote confusion about whether humanity is truly causing global warming by adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
837417 you say theres an effect so there might be some hidden cause

837420 the scientific literature the thousands of scientific papers scattered like seeds in the past we are naturally most interested in those that have borne fruit
837421 historically we can clearly see that hydrocarbon use does not correlate with temperature changes
837422 u s environmental regulators quietly published a draft study on thursday that linked global warming to higher levels of smog that could harm human health
837423 wow they got that wrong gee what about everything else i read maybe i better check for myself
837424 precip 3mm day globally w about 1 w m2 surface energy flux
837425 1 the quantum yield for infrared spectroscopy at atmospheric pressure is usually well below one and quantum yield is defined as number of emitted photons divided by number of absorbed photons this is caused by deexcitation due to collisions this in turn suggests that the relation between emission and absorption is also well below 1 and not 1 as kirchhoffs law suggests
837426 but i dont see you querying gravity the heliocentric model the big bang etc
837427 and given that my recent research has showed that quantum theory is ungrounded how would your interpretations of these results change
837428 stick around here and see how discussions can actually evolve without people resorting to ad homs
837429 smog as all the definitions state is an amorphous mix
837430 a mixture of fog and smoke or other airborne pollutants such as exhaust fumes
837431 fog or haze intensified by smoke or other atmospheric pollutants
837432 air pollution especially in cities that is caused by a mixture of smoke gases and chemicals
837433 a haze caused by the effect of sunlight on foggy air that has been polluted by vehicle exhaust gases and industrial smoke
837434 mixture of particulate matter and chemical pollutants in the lower atmosphere usually over urban areas
837435 originally smog meant a mixture of smoke and fog now it means air that has restricted visibility due to pollution
837436 fool me once shame on me dont be fooled again
837437 i e global temps are likely heading down for the next 10 20 years thus expect stronger attacks from deniers
837438 it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less

837440 lieutenant you dont know if youre shot screwed powder burnt or snake bit
837441 so does the climate computer have a real audience or is it really just another bag lady muttering away to herself in a lonely corner of the intellectual park
837442 contingency planning should entail strategic responses to a warming globe a cooling globe and a globe whose climate reverberates with laughter at human hubris
837443 as the first of every thing in our situation will serve to establish a precedent
837444 it is devoutly wished on my part that these precedents may be fixed on true principles
837445 whose vibrationally excited energy level is much greater than the average kinetic energy of any molecule in the neighborhood
837446 however global mean surface temperature has not risen since 1998 and may have fallen since late 2001

837450 its been great fun and weve learnt a heap but it seems that there just isnt space for a personalising news aggregator to grow large
837451 the technology we developed was great and were happy with how it worked
837452 it did a pretty good job of recommending interesting stories for us and for many users who sent us good feedback
837453 we were aiming to reduce some of the information overload that internet users face online
837454 we did create some great technology to achieve this but unfortunately werent able to grow the market for it
837455 news consumers have a strong affinity for the big brands in news they like the familiarity of the smh or news online and it proved too difficult to drag them away
837456 i think personalisation will have a great future once the big news players implement similar features inside their own sites a personalised smh for example but theres not space for an external aggregator to do it
837457 theres great potential for improvement here but traditional media companies are struggling to keep up as it is well see news personalisation take centre stage in a few years time

837501 a mere seven years after my graduation day i had failed on an epic scale an exceptionally short lived marriage had imploded and i was jobless a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern britain without being homeless
837502 and so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life

837504 theyre two main ways that the media portray women who have disabilities its either kind of passive needing help victim suffering you hear a lot of those words wheelchair bound these negative word connotations on the other hand women with disabilities who have done pretty well for themselves are put up on a pedestal i think sometimes thats a bad thing too

837512 as we prepare to come together in denver however we must be and will be united in our determination to change the course of our nation
837513 to that end democrats in florida and michigan must know that they are full partners and colleagues in our historic mission to reshape washington and lead our country in a new direction
837514 accordingly i ask that the credentials committee pass a resolution that would entitle each delegate from florida and michigan to cast a full vote
837515 a fair process and a unified democratic party so that we can win in november
837516 the democratic party has always stood up for the principle of counting every persons vote
837517 this is the right position for the democratic party and for the country and i urge the credentials committee to restore full votes to florida and michigan delegates
837518 promoting corporatization the sucs can be freed from the shackles of government bureaucratic provisions
837519 empowered to engage in business ventures raise endowments and other income generating activities
837520 her support for the continued corporatization of sucs can only mean higher costs that will push tertiary education beyond the reach of even more students
837521 by announcing corporatization as a cornerstone of her leadership it is evident filipino students and their parents shouldnt expect much in the way of meaningful and much needed reforms in tertiary education
837522 will further drive the profit oriented nature of education in the country
837523 tantamount to the states abandonment of its role of ensuring an education for all it promotes the notion that governments role in the delivery of basic social services is limited to subsidizing a select few

837532 i know for a fact that the cyber gambling operations there port irene have operations outside of ceza they have facilities at rcbc plaza in makati
837533 it gives them an unfair advantage over their rivals i think the senate should include ceza gambling in the hearings and ask why this is not included under pagcors jurisdiction
837534 i wonder what people thought felt heard or walked away with
837535 a man actually walked across america and planted apple trees so did he live off of apples alone while he was doing this or did he just carry apples with him and carelessly dropped them along as he walked
837536 you children actually believe that a man named johnny appleseed packed up his apples and walked across america carelessly dropping them
837537 or he crapped across america unaware he swallowed seeds and they were planted along the way
837538 can you imagine a man squatting at the edge of the road wait got to stop here and plant tree
837539 you mean he ate the apples and pooped across america
837540 well the animals made the trees spread have you ever noticed youll have an orchard and then all of a sudden somewhere along the country side theres an apple tree out in the middle of no where
837541 hello friend my name is john and these are my friends miguel and anne
837542 have one they are the sweetest ripest thing youve ever tasted
837543 someone gave me an apple for the first time and it was bitter rotten
837544 if we all stopped at first bad experiences people wouldnt have sex as often ouch
837545 oh thats all right shes got a point though i suppose i can take my slicker off doesnt look like rain
837546 wish i knew where i was im a might lost
837547 so youve never had a sweet apple huh mr henesee
837548 no fraid not and please you can call me bill
837549 no thankyou id rather sit here and enjoy the shade with you folks if thats alright its nice out today just came out of a storm and
837550 try this one i found the shiniest apple for you im sure this one taste better
837551 eh this one is as bad as the last thankyou anne but i think ill pass i think my medication makes them taste weird
837552 well before you drop that apple down mayi try it maybe we arent picking the right apples
837553 well i have a surprise for you on this one have you ever had ripe blueberries
837554 oh yes i have my favorite fruit my grandmother always had them every summer
837555 well then i have a treat for you this one is a blueberry apple youll love the taste taste like the sweetest blueberries youve ever tasted
837556 mmm wow now thats flavorful its the blueberry without the juicy mess
837557 now we shouldnt be too hastey to have him try all the flavors
837558 lets savor the moment bill where did you say you were from
837559 right off the coast of rhode island im a fisherman been doing it since i was a boy
837560 oh its in our blood you would think of fifty years of it i would have retired and moved on to something else something about the ocean my crew that i cant get away from
837561 somewhat reminds me of a picture i seen when i was a child of this apple orchard and
837562 anne would you like to take a walk with me ive sat too long
837563 i remember when i first told you miguel i still feel bad about that im sorry
837564 its done no worries i would have found out sometime down the road i know someone else would have told me and might not have been as gentle
837565 i think johns better at this then we are i know you were trying anne let john handle it hes seen many others before us im sure hes a pro at this by now its his land i didnt want to be around when he finally understands
837566 kind of sad you know i guess you cant get attached to everyone you meet
837567 that could be a good thing anne can you imagine how many people would be hanging around if they did stay as many stories as john has told us its a good thing they dont stay
837568 why do you suppose they come to john of all the many places they could end up in then again god only knows
837569 yeah and i happened to screw it up that day for you
837570 maybe it was suppose to happen that way im still here arent i i come and go as i please and weve made new friends found old ones
837571 yeah even up here you would think things are different in many ways they are i found my old band teacher the other day and he was much different then i remembered him he wasnt this grungy slothy bastard i remembered him as he was clean cut shavened and had such an uplifting attitude it made me want to be sick but it was him alright looked younger then i remember him we were thirty years apart and to see him look just a few years younger then me is a little disturbing
837572 i met my grandfather for the first time nothing like how he was in pictures but he was everything my mom had told me and more such a wonderful man hes like john he has a place with fields of wheat and grasslands as far as you can see when i found him there was a small group around him
837573 im being part of a concert tonight im surprised at the responses weve been getting
837574 anne look at me did you ever expect to see anyone like me up here i didnt i thought i was going someplace else
837575 yeah thats neat that john uses that as a tool to let the new people know you are ok and you are in a safe place i made mine taste like peanut butter and jelly one time
837576 i made the mistake the other day changing myself to look twelve when i met my grandma
837577 she told me i was being silly in changing myself she knew what i looked like she watched me grow up
837578 i never thought to change my figure when i found joe i hadnt changed much since he seen me last joe died from leukemia when we were sixteen if they knew we could see anything and their thoughts have such an impact its like the best kept secret and really its not a secret weve known all along
837579 consumers are already shell shocked by higher prices but their wallets are going to be hit harder than ever before on their next vacation or business trip
837580 with rising airfares ive had to take a completely different approach to my leisure travel
837581 theres a lot more time invested in researching better fares looking at alternate airports and determining any potential savings from driving to an airport that may not necessarily be closest to home
837582 has initiated or participated in over 30 domestic fare and surcharge increases
837583 while travelers are no doubt feeling pinched especially in light of rising food and gasoline prices it is difficult to blame airlines for raising prices in order to cover costs that are by and large beyond their control
837584 we have had cheap flights and now it is time to pay the bill
837585 theyre starting to look at destinations like buenos aires where you can have a relatively european experience and the dollar goes further
837586 we are doing more teleconferencing and trying to reduce trips to client sites
837587 i think he would occasionally feel frustrated with not being able to communicate or understand
837588 but we have a very patient staff and he seemed to respond well
837589 maybe those passengers will forget the incident one day for his friends and family this is one of the most tragic days of our lives
837590 little guy with a heart bigger than you could know
837591 we sincerely regret that this officiating error was made and cost mr armour the opportunity to play during last nights game
837592 our officials are professionals and do a tremendous job but when a call is missed we take it very seriously and have an internal review system to deal with it appropriately
837593 when you looked at his reaction when it happened there were natural moments that you cannot premeditate
837594 after the push armour took two or three steps because he still had his mind on the play then he turned around and went to the official to see if he was okay the natural reaction under stress is the truth so i have little doubt it was an incident of being blocked into the official

837666 we share with others not only the way they normally act or subjectively experience emotions and sensations but also the neural circuits enabling those same actions emotions and sensations the mirror neuron systems
837667 if investigations provide sufficient data on ethnic genetic differences between population groups it may be possible to use such data to target suitable micro organisms to attack known receptor sites for which differences exist at cell membrane level or even to target dna sequences inside cells by viral vectors
837668 these developments are some years away and in some cases are likely to be more fictional than real
837669 another ghastly application of genetic engineering to biological warfare first proposed in 1970 in the american military journal military review involves the exploitation of subtle hereditary differences between ethnic populations a pathogen would be modified so it would be most likely to infect people of a particular ethnic background leaving those of other ethnicities relatively unharmed the ultimate in racial discrimination these tactic has the potential to virtually eliminate certain ethnic groups while leaving others untouched
837670 scientists say they may be able to clone selective toxins to eliminate
837671 there is emerging international concern about the possibilities of ethnic warfare using targeted biological weapons
837672 the groundwork for a grand jury that could lead to criminal charges
837673 it is my aim and it is my hope that we will witness a grand jury investigation with reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this information i believe the safety of this nation and the people of this country deserve nothing less
837674 this is the first administration that i can remember including nixons that said we need to think about a law that would put journalists who print national security things up in front of grand juries and put them in jail if they dont reveal their sources
837675 were talking about a basic violation of the constitutional guarantee of a free press as well as a violation of the rights of privacy of american citizens
837676 i had hoped we would have learned our lessons from the nixon era sadly it appears we have not
837677 in essence while the president sits in the white house undisturbed after proudly announcing that he has been breaking the law and will continue to do so his slavish political appointees at the justice department are using the mammoth law enforcement powers of the federal government to find and criminally prosecute those who brought this illegal conduct to light
837678 this flamboyant use of the forces of criminal prosecution to threaten whistle blowers and intimidate journalists are nothing more than the naked tactics of street thugs and authoritarian juntas

837691 in any case the finale involved in part removing decorative door knockers from two hallway panels which fit together to make a crank which in turn opened hidden panels in a credenza in the dining room which displayed multiple keys and keyholes which when the correct ones were used yielded drawers containing acrylic letters and a table size cloth imprinted with the beginnings of a crossword puzzle the answers to which led to one of the rectangular panels lining the tiny den which concealed a chamfered magnetic cube which could be used to open the 24 remaining panels revealing in large type the poem written by mr klinsky

837699 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
837700 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage

837774 we have been happily borne or perhaps have unhappily dragged our weary way down the long and crooked streets of our lives past all kinds of walls and fences made of rotting wood rammed earth brick concrete iron railings we have never given a thought to what lies behind them we have never tried to penetrate them with our vision or our understanding but there is where the gulag country begins right next to us two yards away from us in addition we have failed to notice an enormous number of closely fitted well disguised doors and gates in these fences all those gates were prepared for us every last one and all of a sudden the fateful gate swings quickly open and four white male hands unaccustomed to physical labour but nonetheless strong and tenacious grab us by the leg arm collar cap ear and drag us in like a sack and the gate behind us the gate to our past life is slammed shut once and for all

837805 today was a real good step forward in that direction
837806 today i threw the ball with real pop the last time i did that was march 31 for me its been two steps forward and one step back
837807 the whole day was encouraging being able to go out there and command the strike zone on a consistent basis and throw all three pitches for strikes which was big
837808 we need a certain amount of time but were not at that point yet
837809 you saw ryan rowland smith also being converted to starting how long did that take hes already ready it doesnt take long
837810 within two weeks you can have him stretched out enough to go five innings weve got seven weeks to go in the season were not looking for brandon to come out here and go eight or nine innings
837811 were down in the ballgame and he really got into one the wind helped us because it had all the distance but it was one of those ones that sometimes go foul the wind helped us out and that was huge
837812 i know hes got a pretty good sinker but in that situation i think hes coming to the middle down 2 0
837813 he really showed some discipline didnt just stab at something that was thrown up there
837814 he was trying to bunt the runner over but he took the walk and that really set us up in the inning
837815 the most important thing right now is to be able to go out and repeat pound the strike zone today i was able to do that

837829 russia did a good job of slowing us down a little bit but we still made our run at the end of the third quarter

837831 for the most part i think we did a pretty good job to stop them
837832 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

837848 hi michael weve done several versions of the bell over the years and one of the things thats felt particularly anemic to my eyes has been the prop effect weve always used a two prop blur effect and the thing is it just doesnt look like what you see in real life sure when you see a photo of a 206 prop you see two blades weve tried a few different effects and have settled on the effect you see reflected in the shots floating around i know that it looks a little off in a static screenshot but i hope youll like the result when its in motion in the sim
837849 very true jason a real pic looks pretty much like 2 blades with even less of a blur than in the current texture and when spinning looks like the new blur i am a heli fanatic and have repainted nearly every model that has been in fs since fs2002 and the rotor blur has always been something i am very critical off if the new one is still based on a texture then we can alter it for personal preference once its released so no worries
837850 but you sure we still have a propeller i dont see it anymore
837851 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
837852 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
837853 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
837854 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
837855 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
837856 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
837857 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
837858 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
837859 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
837860 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
837861 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
837862 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
837863 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
837864 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
837865 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
837866 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
837867 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
837868 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
837869 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
837870 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
837871 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
837872 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
837873 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
837874 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
837875 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
837876 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
837877 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
837878 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
837879 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
837880 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
837881 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
837882 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
837883 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
837884 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
837885 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
837886 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
837887 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
837888 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
837889 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
837890 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
837891 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
837892 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
837893 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
837894 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
837895 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
837896 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
837897 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
837898 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
837899 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
837900 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
837901 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
837902 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
837903 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
837904 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
837905 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
837906 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
837907 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
837908 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
837909 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
837910 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
837911 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
837912 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
837913 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
837914 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
837915 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
837916 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
837917 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
837918 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
837919 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
837920 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
837921 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
837922 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
837923 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
837924 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
837925 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
837926 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
837927 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
837928 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
837929 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
837930 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
837931 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
837932 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
837933 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
837934 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
837935 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
837936 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
837937 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
837938 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
837939 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
837940 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
837941 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
837942 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
837943 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
837944 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
837945 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
837946 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
837947 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
837948 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
837949 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
837950 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
837951 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
837952 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
837953 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
837954 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
837955 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis

837967 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
837968 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
837969 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
837970 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament

837980 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
837981 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
837982 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
837983 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
837984 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
837985 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
837986 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
837987 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
837988 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
837989 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
837990 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
837991 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
837992 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
837993 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
837994 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
837995 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
837996 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
837997 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
837998 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
837999 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
838000 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
838001 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
838002 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
838003 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
838004 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
838005 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
838006 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
838007 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
838008 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis

838020 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
838021 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
838022 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
838023 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
838024 steph and i get to as many as we can get to and fit into the schedule and it really is just the heart and soul of the state and in my judgment the heart and soul of our country
838025 well they all keep coming up and thanking us and we should be thanking them they got it backwards as i said before the military is the one that deserves the thanks
838026 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
838027 our study sheds new light on how that process works
838028 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
838029 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
838030 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
838031 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
838032 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
838033 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
838034 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
838035 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
838036 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
838037 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
838038 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
838039 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
838040 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
838041 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
838042 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
838043 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
838044 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
838045 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
838046 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
838047 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
838048 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
838049 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
838050 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
838051 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
838052 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
838053 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
838054 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
838055 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
838056 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
838057 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
838058 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
838059 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
838060 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
838061 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
838062 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
838063 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
838064 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
838065 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
838066 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
838067 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
838068 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
838069 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
838070 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
838071 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
838072 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
838073 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
838074 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
838075 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
838076 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
838077 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
838078 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
838079 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
838080 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
838081 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
838082 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
838083 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
838084 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
838085 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
838086 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
838087 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
838088 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
838089 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
838090 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
838091 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
838092 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
838093 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
838094 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
838095 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
838096 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
838097 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
838098 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
838099 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
838100 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
838101 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
838102 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
838103 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
838104 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
838105 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
838106 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
838107 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
838108 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
838109 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
838110 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
838111 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
838112 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
838113 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
838114 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
838115 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
838116 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
838117 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
838118 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
838119 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
838120 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
838121 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
838122 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
838123 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
838124 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
838125 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited
838126 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
838127 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
838128 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
838129 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
838130 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
838131 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
838132 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
838133 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
838134 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children
838135 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
838136 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
838137 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
838138 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
838139 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
838140 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
838141 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
838142 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
838143 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
838144 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
838145 for the past five years countless latin artists and singers have truly embraced the life mission of st jude by supporting the angels amp stars gala
838146 thanks to their contribution and charitable donations they are helping us save the lives of children with deadly diseases
838147 fedex is proud to continue increasing critical awareness and philanthropic support for st jude
838148 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
838149 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
838150 we will do whatever we can to save these children
838151 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
838152 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
838153 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
838154 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
838155 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
838156 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
838157 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
838158 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
838159 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
838160 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
838161 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
838162 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
838163 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
838164 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
838165 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
838166 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
838167 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
838168 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
838169 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
838170 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
838171 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
838172 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
838173 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
838174 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
838175 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
838176 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
838177 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
838178 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
838179 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
838180 can this bundle of sticks possibly be a working loom
838181 just because its a dvr doesnt mean its a tivo
838182 we are going to make sure the project is delivered
838183 it will be aboveground it will be transparent the same elegant look will exist
838184 this is after all one of the most important things that weve done from a transportation point of view from a hub point of view in many years
838185 what is really important is we get on with it and the mta builds what they said they would build an above grade iconic transportation center with retail and that they build it now
838186 you get some of your most enthusiast customers who would be more than willing to pay more money to tivo but they no longer have to and what weve basically done is for the cost of lifetime substituted that with a three year deal
838187 he is worse than bush all bush wanted was to have fun go to parties and be able to say hey guys guess what i am the president mccain is an sexist violent nutcase
838188 but you always knew you would get to do good work and work on good buildings
838189 as far as tucson goes its a pretty big deal working at ua
838190 whenever a ua job comes up well get people calling wanting work because they want to lay brick there its kind of a notch in your trowel
838191 i brought my son to the ua job this summer just to ensure that five generations have been involved in bricklaying on campus
838192 but tommy and i have really pushed them to make a living with their brains and not their backs
838193 kurts got an academic scholarship here at ua and i tell him look youre squandering a hopeful future with your brains for what
838194 you get a sense of accomplishment ill see what college does for me but id also like to do the apprentice program with cox masonry because i kind of feel it would be a shame to see the trade die out with my generation there arent many bricklayers out there
838195 most everyone in the past 30 years is more of a concrete block mason than a brick mason
838196 really the only brick you see here is tusd and ua you get guys who say i can lay brick but if youve laid block all your life youre not going to be able to lay brick
838197 they can work during breaks but this is a hard job and it gets harder all the time
838198 with a brick manufacturer downtown it was accessible and attractive
838199 these were stories about men in my day men who would show up for work in a white shirt and tie and at the end of a day of laying brick would barely be dirty because they were just that good
838200 you grew up seeing them as the princes of the trades it is hard to explain but when youre a young kid working out there with some of these old guys laying brick just gets under your skin and its hard to let go
838201 beginning in the 40s and 50s they started inventing concrete block and construction moved to that because brick was more expensive we do about 4 million in business annually and 90 percent of it is concrete block
838202 there will be exceptions but theyre usually far from the historic core
838203 were committed to what made us special in the first place and that includes red bricks red roof tiles and open spaces that said we dont believe we have to do the whole building out of red bricks anymore because it is cost prohibitive we utilize red brick in areas where it is visible and we dont put it where it cant be seen buildings arent built the old way
838204 with the ica facility we wanted to be sure the visible sides to the campus and community had red brick but the south side faces the swimming complex which is made of different material and we wanted those buildings to blend together
838205 the hilles family is a respectful family which has an honourable past
838206 and the campaign was not against the family but rather against fugitives who hid behind the familys name and committed criminal acts
838207 attacks around the world have shown that terrorists will attack those targets they perceive as being attractive
838208 amongst the likely targets for international terrorists are locations with comparatively limited protective security measures which afford the potential for terrorists to cause mass casualties
838209 there were six great gosvamis of vrindavana srila rupa sanatana bhatta raghunatha sri jiva gopala bhatta and dasa raghunatha and none of them inherited the title of gosvami

838219 he finally lifted his eyes to the lord and praised him his understanding was restored
838220 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the daylong we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord

838225 if there is no moratorium then the communion will split he said
838226 pay careful attention to the words must should and do for an indication of how strong the moratorium will be
838227 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
838228 the current policy well i wouldnt say policy of the american church but some of the practices of dioceses or certain dioceses in the american church continues to put our relations as a communion under strain and some problems wont be resolved while those practices continue
838229 i might just add perhaps a note here one complication in discussing all this is that assumption readily made that the blessing of a same sex union and or the ordination of someone in an active same sex relationship is simply a matter of human rights thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issues about what conditions the church lays down for the blessing of unions has to be shaped by its own thinking its own praying
838230 there are those in the u s a who would say pastoral response well its a blessing and im not very happy about that
838231 i dont think i can go into details because i dont have direct management of the question im rather concerned about that

838237 its like waking up in the morning and squeezing your tube of toothpaste on your brush green tea flavour until you taste it against your molars but you continue brushing anyway because toothpaste is good and brushing is a routine and fights are like that you let them fade away because you think its okay even though its horrible you forget because its better for leaves to be blown away in the wind than to be plastered onto your eyes

838249 hey stevil just figured id give you a little heads up on an mtv thing that was shot in my town lots o swobo logos bro clicky for linky and i stumbled across this photo i thought you might be stoked on yep those would be interwoven bacon slices for use as insulation between bun and burger tyler
838250 i saw this the other day when i was drinking on my day off i almost got backed into and risked life and limb to get this for you signs of the suv apocalypse
838251 stevil thought you might like this one so im riding along this morning on my inbound commute enjoying the views along the animas river trail in durango co pic 1 we are currently in a beautiful weather pattern here early season monsoonal activity trails are october tacky road riding is sublime i cross the bridge to where my office awaits and i see this pic 2 i gather from the evidence he drove to the adjacent parking lot and lugged his gear out on to the trail to get some work in now i hate to bag on anyone who is avoiding the couch but isnt this like bringing sand to the beach sean m

838253 hey stevil thanks for featuring my story of carnage and stick to itiveness a few weeks back im almost all healed up that wet healing method is indeed a lot better although peeling wet scabs off your arm every morning in the shower is a drag i only bring this to your attention reluctantly as i am not a superstitious man but take a look at the race numbers i had for the buffalo creek xterra see pic there were two numbers in the race pack one for the bike one for the run it takes a little addition but as you know i crashed like a sack of potatoes if that sack of potatoes happened to be riding in a downhill race i will speculate no further while i was recovering and telling my harrowing tale to coworkers in the office i was soon made to feel like an ass because the thursday after my wipeout my coworker katie was hit while walking across the street by a left turning in attentive driver going about 30 mph katie may weigh about 102 lbs so she did not win in this showdown my only hope is that since she was in a crosswalk crossing on the walk sign and the driver was on their phone that katie will soon be a wealthier woman and not have to trouble herself with unpleasantries such as data entry she said its cool if you want to use her picture that picture was taken while katie and i observed a kickball game which we normally participate in during healthier times and so instead we drank coors on the sidelines my big moment came when an errant ball bounced my way and on my slow jog to retrieve it i ended up rolling my ankle and mangling the tendon that makes my left foot work properly the damn ankle injury hobbled me more than the bike wipeout and turned my whole foot a lovely shade of putrid purple for a few days time just goes to show you need to avoid the bummer life as much as possible since you never know when you will be crippled chasing down a kick ball or flattened by a rav4 while innocently crossing the street yours truly will

838263 hey stevil love the site cuttin to the chase i was at work the other day at the lbs and it happens to be next to a grocery store we are good friends with the manager of the store apparently they have way to many pies because they are on sale 24 7 so our bud the manager brought us a few pies now the same day i happened to have some relatives in town for dinner so i took a pie to feed the out of towners the only reason i took the pie is because i happened to take the basket off an old 1984 free spirit greenbrier sears and roebuck top of the line back then and put it on my commuter as opposed to my usual backpack the basket was just big enough read an inch too small to hold the box that incarcerated the pie this didnt seem like much of a problem until on the road i hit a pothole and boom apple pie became apple crumble i made it the rest of the way with the crumble in the box and when i arrived it was a hit with the family the next morning i was in the garage painting the free spirit when my younger brother was looking at my commuter bike he noticed that the cycling computers odometer said 1668 miles i thought that was odd and paid it no mind until talking about the crumble later i then ran to the pc and mapped my commute i looked for the area where the pie destroying pothole was and guess how far it was from my house 2 miles making the odometer reading 1666 when my pie kicked the bucket or should i say kicked the basket peace ben r wilmington nc

838280 environmentalism has already come dangerously close to being a religion without being pushed any further the idea of declaring flying a sin absolutely appalls me the idea of restraining demand is one way of addressing the problem another of course is to go for nuclear power which doesnt emit so if you just substitute the words it is a sin not to campaign for nuclear power i think you begin to reveal the essence of this which is that it is not a religious problem it is a political question the extent to which people should be restrained from doing what they wish to do the extent to which we should provide subsidies for new technologies these are not religious questions these are political issues

838301 certainly over the past few years there was much foolish lending that had led to severe losses and the economy will suffer in the short run but actions by central banks will assure that this credit crisis does not morph into a full blown recession or worse and in the long run saner lending and more reasonable home prices will lead to a stronger economic recovery
838302 the best case scenario is a mild recession and a slow recovery that s the best ocutcome we can hope for

838331 the argument came from when it started raining real hard then we were trying to blame one another for the idea of coming onto pit road
838332 bob said it was my idea and i really felt like it was his idea i had to leave the pit box because i was worried bob was going to like punch me in the neck or something
838333 i had to walk away but personally i feel like we have a good relationship we can be perfectly honest with one another and thats really valuable
838334 its not out of the ordinary for us to argue
838335 we get mad at each other we walk away and then we walk back together and calmer heads prevail and we have a discussion nine nine percent of the time it works out for us
838336 i was really nervous that we made the wrong call there
838337 bobs the smartest guy in the world we were really arguing we made light of it but we thought we made the wrong call

838339 it also almost surprisingly features a product designer tom dixon
838340 epitaph to her reign with barely a conventional product in sight
838341 design is not art designers are usually paid to do a job and if the product is successful they have the pleasure of seeing their design become generic omnipresent of seeing it making peoples lives better what more reward could you want
838342 the d amp ad global awards remain the one true marker of creative excellence globally
838343 the internet is only doing to politics what it has done to other industries it disaggregates elements and then enables these free atoms to reaggregate into new molecules
838344 part of a government backed drive to improve all skills across the uk
838345 has come up with a set of ideas for building a better design industry now we need you to work on them too
838346 the reason uk designers are so successful and are likely to remain successful is their intimate knowledge of customers in the local markets of europe
838347 what is important is not how close we are to the source of manufacturing but how close we are to our customers
838348 is this the basis for britains long term future absolutely better to be a contributor to global success than the keeper of our own failures
838349 free from the constraints of manufacturing innovative in understanding customers and globally perceived as creative british design is better able to help companies both from afar and on our doorstep if only they would wake up and realise it
838350 the reality that britain doesnt make much any more or that its designers predominantly work for foreign companies is old news but is it a problem
838351 the whole concept of british design sounds positively quaint and delusional talk of being best in the world smacks of a bygone little englander era
838352 designers here can still compete however the emphasis must be on permanent innovation in what kind of work we do and how it is done as well as in the work itself
838353 focuses on better benchmarking and teaching of existing and increasingly commoditised knowledge
838354 despite its grand call to design a new design industry it meekly recommends more of the same
838355 i have a hunch we should be building a fractal system

838374 but he got down on his belly and he won though
838375 i thought we had a helluva shot turning for home i thought to myself we could do this again i am very happy right now we made him run thats for sure big brown looked great in the paddock and when he broke but down the backside i got excited coal play ran a big race
838376 hes a top horse it was little more than i was expecting he really struggled out there to run this horse down but zitos horse ran great
838377 he found a new gear and just kept sticking his neck out i knew he was going to get there at the top of the stretch that horse coal play took off but big brown took off after him today he showed hes a warrior
838378 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans

838382 it started as a joke between friends one night and it just grew from there i probably had too much red wine
838383 at the end of the day this was all right because at least now no one can say that i have special treatment

838388 the capacity of interfacial water layers to impose order was exposed in the process of formation of supercubane carbon nanocrystals
838389 it is important that the order imposed to molecules landing on hydrogenated diamond is more durable and superior to that realizable on any other origin of life platform for instance graphite hydrogenated diamond advances to the best of all possible origin of life
838390 origin of life models starting with a primordial soup work from two assumptions which do not exclude each other chemistry which could trigger the self assembly of abiotic organic compounds and transfer of order from preexistent orderings
838391 clearly both organization processes must occur in a bio relevant environment that is a wet milieu and both are energy consuming
838392 in our study the conductivity on natural diamond was better by a factor of 10 than that on synthetic diamond
838393 we conclude that current ideas of surface conducting diamond should be expanded to include the crystalline water layer
838394 the emergence of bio organic molecules under primitive earth conditions is one of the major unsolved origin of life questions
838395 the principal problem is to identify physical and chemical conditions that are favourable for the formation of life precursor structures

838458 livin la vida low carb show episode 162 zero carb dieting with charles washington
838459 you cannot fatten hogs on wheat wheat has a high starch content and is low in fat corn on the other hand has a fairly high fat content thus to fatten hogs you must provide them with preformed fat in recent years researchers have arrived at the same conclusion abot the human body it too is very poor at turning carbohydrates into fat this observation has tremendous implications for irritable bowel sufferers it suggests that the fat accumulated in the body is fat which has been eaten not fat that has been manufactured in the body by the conversion of carbohydrates or proteins you do not become fat from eating carbohydrates but from eating fats in mild irritable bowel disease fats are absorbed excessively
838460 an optimal diet is one that is low in fat
838461 call me crazy but i cant help wondering if the low carb group would had lost even more weight if they had eaten less than the 120 grams of carbs these folks ate all the while keeping calories at a moderate reduced amount and incorporating other lifestyle changes like exercise and stress reduction can you imagine a more reasonable level of under 100 grams a day or even less might have made a lot of a level that seems to work the best for people who have problems with sugar insulin and carbohydrates in general
838462 this study adds to the body of evidence that suggests that lower carb and carb controlled eating has distinct merit and generally has the capacity to out perform low fat diets in the weight loss stakes and without any conscious restriction of food intake either the results of this study suggest that such a diet may be superior in terms of cardiovascular disease risk too
838463 the major significance of the nejm paper is that it is confirmatory of much work that has gone before it is really not as portrayed in the media revolutionary much prior work from the laboratories of jeff volek eric westman steve phinney jay wortman mary gannon and frank nuttal and others has shown that carbohydrates beyond simple calories have a role in controlling how fats are used or stored directly or indirectly through insulin carbohydrates encourage the storage rather than burning of fat and lead to the organization of fat into the cholesterol containing particles that have been associated with cardiovascular disease at the same time the nejm paper also confirms the evolving picture of fat as playing a passive role and emphasizes that what was once thought to be an intuitive benefit for lowering fat has consistently not panned out the new article is a key block in a scientific structure that has been put together by many previous investigators if the nejm paper finally catalyzes some recognition of the scientific principles of carbohydrate restriction it will be a very important contribution
838464 for years carbohydrate restriction and the low carb folks those of us who really spent our lives telling patients they could regain metabolic control and kind of being ostracized for it were finally validated
838465 the findings from the recent nejm study that showed a diet lower in carbohydrate outperformed a low fat diet confirms our previous work and that of many others it is unique in that the intervention was 2 years and yet there was a very low subject attrition rate over such a long period of time the low carbohydrate diet was only moderately restricted in carbohydrates about 40 of calories based on our research had the level of carbohydrate restriction been in the 10 15 range the results would have been even more impressive the results add to a growing body of work supporting the value of restricting carbohydrate as opposed to fat for superior weight management and metabolic health
838466 these latest trials just happen to be the best data we have on the long term effects of saturated fat in the diet and the best data we have says that more saturated fat is better than less it may be true that if we lowered saturated fat further say to 7 of all calories as the american heart association is now recommending or total fat down to 10 percent as dean ornish argues or raised saturated fat to 20 percent of calories as keys did that wed see a different result but thats just another hypothesis the trials havent been done to test it its also hard to imagine why a small decrease in saturated fat would be deleterious but a larger decrease would be beneficial its also true that i dont think that ldl is a particularly meaningful predictor of heart disease risk and i think total cholesterol is meaningless based on the evidence that i recount in the book but the point is that the aha and the national cholesterol education program and the authorities at the national heart lung and blood institute do think ldl is meaningful and thats the basis by which they have always recommended low saturated fat diets they also think that total cholesterol hdl is the single best predictor of heart disease risk so by their assessment more saturated fat is better than less i think the best predictors of risk regarding cholesterol profiles are hdl and the size and density of the ldl particles themselves and maybe measurements of a protein known as apob the protein component of the ldl particle itself and the existing diet trials in those cases also suggest that saturated fats are at worst harmless and perhaps even beneficial last point the funding its true that the study was financed by the atkins foundation but to assume that the researchers went out and falsified their findings or twisted their observations to satisfy the source of funding is naive regrettably the only institutions that will finance clinical trials for the most part are those that stand to gain from the results thats why the pharmaceutical industry finances drug trials it would be nice if the government financed all these trials but they dont so its up to the atkins foundation and any other organizations that might hold similar beliefs in this case the atkins funded diet trial observed the exact same results as similar nih funded diet trials

838501 vp buzz gets romney headlines and speaking engagements around the country without being overshadowed and having to share in the downsides of an uphill presidential campaign but its still unlikely he would get picked because of the questionable personal chemistry between the two men and romney has to know this but as a high level surrogate romney gets to travel around the country making the case for mccain better than mccain himself and leaving the base hungry for more

838519 fast forward six months and romneys stock is rising as a top choice to be mccains vice presidential running mate raising questions of whether the two can overcome personal enmity and join hands to win novembers u s presidential election political experts say the weakening u s economy the no 1 issue for voters could sway mccain to pick romney whose experience as a successful former venture capitalist could compensate for mccains weaknesses in economic matters they add that romney a multimillionaire former massachusetts governor would bring considerable strengths to the arizona senators bid for the white house from a proven ability to raise big money and connect with conservative republicans to his telegenic good looks and executive style the polished communicator with combed back salt and pepper hair also would add a dose of youthfulness
838520 romney is 61 years old a decade younger than mccain who would be the oldest person ever elected to a first presidential term sen
838521 they are two very different kinds of people there is clearly a lot of tension between the two
838522 but that never stops anyone from joining into an alliance if they can win and given the odds republicans face and given the challenges that mccain faces in winning if romney brings him that one asset that changes his odds i think mccain would be more than willing to enter into that alliance

838634 wilco was up there three days and three nights above 8000m without supplementary oxygen after a few days everyone thought hed died
838635 then people from base camp saw this lone figure in an orange suit coming down the mountain on sunday
838636 even though mark is the australian in the team this is historically the biggest story to come out of this
838637 its a pretty amazing story hes very lucky guy he was way up at c4 when all this happened
838638 c4 is the highest camp on the mountain so its well in the so called death zone
838639 what saved him was he was actually one day behind all the climbers ordinarily he would have left for the summit the same day as everybody else
838640 on our route there seems to be an issue with tent space and my concern is when i can go up for a summit push which i know i have in me there now appears to be 6 climbers including me wanting to reach the top and there is only room for well 5 climbers not including me to go up
838641 this is disappointing so maybe it is best for me to wait for the first party and go another two days past
838642 some might say it was divine intervention that mark was held up a day
838643 i asked his family what his emotional state was he was probably numb at this stage its all probably a bit surreal
838644 k2 had always been a goal for him and the fact that he got to the final camp without using his supplementary oxygen means he did a fairly amazing job k2 is definitely harder much steeper the weather conditions are really bad
838645 they were on the return from the summit when a big chunk of ice fell off none of the ice struck the climbers but it took the ropes away and all the climbers were left stranded

838689 as a recently launched concept we realised that chew tv was only going to succeed if people knew about it but simply going into schools and inviting young people to get involved with chew tv wasnt enough we needed some kind of vehicle that could allow us to take a school by storm and so was born the chew tv music tour
838690 so often a project is devised and the young people slot into it
838691 but here they have been involved since day one and have been shaping it so that the tour is exactly what young people want not what we think they want
838692 it is great being taught by people our own age to see these people that are no older than us who are already so involved in the music industry is a real inspiration

838740 yah lumayan lah dari pada tidak ada foto kenang kenangan
838741 pengamanan sangat ketat saya sudah beberapa kali ke beijing tidak pernah saya lihat pengamanan seketat sini
838742 tapi saya bisa memaklumi kondisi seperti ini karena memang pemerintah china tentunya ingin menciptakan rasa aman saat olimpiade berlangsung
838743 gedung mpc juga ketat sistem pengamanannya sehingga tidak semua wartawan boleh masuk wartawan non akreditasi pun tidak diizinkan masuk gedung itu
838744 keamanan kian ditingkatkan di beberapa lokasi terutama di sekitar tempat pelaksanaan pertandingan olimpiade terkait adanya ledakan bom di kunming beberapa waktu lalu
838745 terorisme memang bisa terjadi di mana mana termasuk di china namun kami tetap melakukan pengamanan ketat khususnya menjelang olimpiade pihak kepolisian setempat sudah menyampaikan keterangan lebih rinci soal kejadian itu
838746 this is peter pan i hope they break up before they grow up
838747 gratitude and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these great warrior soldiers in the freeing of the iraqi people and in helping us in iraq to recover from tyranny and dictatorship
838748 there are a lot of people in tough housing situations who dont get counted
838749 its the olympics you know police are cracking down on places like this
838750 but in issue 15 of selvedge magazine the editor polly leonard talks about believing that its better to spend time making one beautiful thing rather than many so so items sometimes it gets discouraging to look at my knit gallery and see so few items but in the end id rather have fewer more beautiful items remembering that beauty is subjective
838751 with its practicability decorative potential and the unhurried pace at which it must be executed hand knitting must be fashions most charming medium
838752 first and foremost it feels great to play every day and not be injured
838753 it has been hard because of the prolonged injuries and the same thing for the last three years i always had the confidence this day was going to come its not something i would definitely wish on anybody else its been a trying three years i just keep telling myself life cant be fair sometimes its the way it is
838754 all i wanted to focus on is being healthy i figured id be here to start the year next year
838755 ive never been swift with the feet ive always been able to read balls off of bats to get good jumps to make up for my lack of speed my very first dabble in pro ball was in instructional league in 2002 i had a wrist injury and couldnt take batting practice i must have taken 400 ground balls a day
838756 in a way my back has almost helped me become a better hitter
838757 before i had a real long swing and would try to pull balls i shouldnt i had to change my swing my back wouldnt hold up with a big long loopy swing and the recoil it helps me stay on offspeed stuff more
838758 it does bother me but definitely not like it did before
838759 they contacted him he tried to walk away continued to walk into traffic
838760 they were convinced that he was a danger to himself and others
838761 if the north american churches dont accept the need for moratoria then to say the least we are no further forward
838762 that means as a communion we continue to be in grave peril
838763 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
838764 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
838765 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
838766 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
838767 we want to win more than 10 games this year
838768 weve won 10 games the last couple of years and we need to win more than 10 this year
838769 were very proud of the leadership on and off the field
838770 hes such an anchor and means so much to us leonard davis that flos departure might have disrupted that
838771 its amazing when you think about that because guys get shipped around a lot over the years especially after the first four or five
838772 im still working as hard as i always have and im just hoping to do the best i can
838773 you dont have to worry about him i think thats a good statement
838774 sometimes you tend to overlook him because they do a good job all the time
838775 there is no jumping around guys have got to take me on theres no running around so to speak
838776 and for the most part the guys i am playing against i have more athletic ability than those guys
838777 leonard is a real football player that can dominate in a lot of areas
838778 we found out thats what he can do besides just dominating a defensive tackle he can pull and help us on off tackle plays and even outside plays
838779 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
838780 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
838781 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
838782 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
838783 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
838784 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
838785 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
838786 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
838787 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
838788 weve just got to come out and continue playing good baseball
838789 we definitely had some opportunities we really didnt take advantage of them
838790 but i feel real confident that well turn this around and swing the bats the way were capable of
838791 we dont want to be scoreboard watching later on we dont want to wait til september to make our move we have to push ourselves and get it going again
838792 we should be ok some of the guys i wont say they were pressing but in situations we werent getting hits
838793 weve got to find a way to get better at that
838794 their bullpen came in and it seemed like this whole series they shut us down
838795 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
838796 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
838797 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
838798 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
838799 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
838800 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
838801 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
838802 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
838803 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
838804 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
838805 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
838806 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
838807 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
838808 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
838809 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
838810 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
838811 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
838812 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
838813 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
838814 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
838815 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
838816 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
838817 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
838818 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
838819 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
838820 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
838821 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
838822 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
838823 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
838824 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
838825 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
838826 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
838827 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
838828 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
838829 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

838834 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
838835 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
838836 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
838837 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region

838842 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
838843 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
838844 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
838845 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
838846 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
838847 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
838848 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
838849 i just had to be comfortable over it i hit on the right edge and it actually started right where i aimed and went in the hole im really relieved
838850 i had a good finish there at the end i kept hitting a lot of good shots but my putting was not the best all day
838851 i struck the ball really well especially with my irons except for the second day my driver was really good all week
838852 this win puts me in a really good frame of mind going into next week and the rest of the season
838853 intemperance was common enough and the bible contains a number of unfavorable references to excessive drin ing wine is praised it rejoices god and men judges 9 13 it gladdens the heart of men psalms 104 15 it gladdens life exodus 10 19 it ma es the heart exult zechariah 10 7 it cheers the spirits of the depressed proverbs 31 6 the attitude of jesus toward wine li e that of the entire bible is neutral praising its use and finding fault in its intemperate use certainly the production of wine at hn 2 1 11 scarcely supports any belief that jesus or the primitive church regarded the use of wine as sinful in itself

838861 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
838862 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
838863 the same people who sell them today at 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
838864 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments
838865 so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication
838866 theyre for defensive purposes were not going to attack anybody

838878 what we need to do now is get to that first regular season game where we can really tell exactly where we are
838879 weve decided how were going to play all of our players
838880 if hes not playing thats not on our end thats something that carolina had to deal with
838881 im not going to say smith not playing is good or bad it just happened that way
838882 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
838883 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire
838884 as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
838885 talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly
838886 i think its come to the point where there need to be some decisions made on behalf of the packers on behalf of brett on behalf of all the fans
838887 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party

838922 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
838923 and theres no doubt in my mind that what sen obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
838924 what he is saying is that he is a different kind of candidate a different kind of leader a person who has come to washington with a different agenda of someone who really does want to be a vehicle for change
838925 all indications are that there was no release of radioactivity to the environment

838936 i thank my new teammates who gave me a very warm welcome
838937 i was the one who chose reggina and i did so because the president made me feel wanted
838938 we had the wrong attitude for this friendly it was an important game
838939 the match was already difficult but after going 3 0 down in 15 minutes things got even more complicated
838940 it is a bad blow but now lets hope the holiday season is over
838941 there was nothing to take from the game but we must look forward
838942 we had an agreement with his agent and triestina but when it came to the player he refused

838950 we had to make sure they came to the ballpark and played with enthusiasm one of the keys today is that we played enthusiastically and with passion and a little emotion
838951 it was a must win you have to take care of game 1 first and we made sure we did then we had to think about game 2 and it carried over i had a few goals and one was winning it all and we had to get to the playoffs first and we did its really relieving and now we can go for the ultimate goal
838952 it felt good coming into that last inning knowing i had a nice nine run lead
838953 putting up that eight spot in the sixth inning was huge its our first three game winning streak all year so lets just keep going
838954 i was looking fastball but he hung a slider over the middle of the plate
838955 i poked it over the fence it felt pretty good
838956 everybody talked to each other and we said we had to go hard
838957 just because we lost one didnt mean we were going to give up
838958 we had to make sure they came to the ballpark and played with enthusiasm one of the keys today is that we played enthusiastically and with passion and a little emotion

838960 it felt good coming into that last inning knowing i had a nice nine run lead
838961 putting up that eight spot in the sixth inning was huge its our first three game winning streak all year so lets just keep going
838962 i was looking fastball but he hung a slider over the middle of the plate
838963 i poked it over the fence it felt pretty good
838964 everybody talked to each other and we said we had to go hard
838965 just because we lost one didnt mean we were going to give up
838966 walks at the wrong time errors a lot of errors physical and mental errors a lot of opportunities for the opposition most of the time weve been scored upon first

838973 while the earth as a whole has warmed about 1 3 degrees fahrenheit over the last century alaska has warmed more than 3 degrees in the last 50 years alaskans are already grappling with shifting animal species altered weather patterns and villages made uninhabitable in part because of shrinking sea ice
838974 it had been a weird summer it was so warm people joked about getting tan and now it was a weird fall there wasnt enough ice on the rivers to go ice fishing and geese were still hanging around town a whaling captains nephew had shot his first walrus a few weeks before the inupiat eskimos hunt them along with seals and bowhead whales but when he cut it open there was nothing in its stomach sometimes there are clams you can eat other people were saying theyd seen walrus that looked thin and there were reports that lots of walrus were hauling out farther down the shore
838975 the arctic sea ice is in a condition we have not seen since satellites began taking measurements
838976 thin first year ice dominated the arctic early in the melt season thin ice is much more vulnerable to melting completely during the summer it seems likely that we will see a faster than normal rate of decline through the rest of the summer
838977 so will we break last years record low minimum extent will the north pole become ice free probably not this year however the ice is in a vulnerable state and there are six weeks of melting left so a lot can still happen and perhaps the most important point as we continue to watch this seasons evolving ice cover is that whether or not arctic sea ice sets a new record low this year continues the pattern of well below average ice extent seen in recent years
838978 four corners journeys to the arctic circle to explore how the melt is challenging human understanding of global warming the four corners team joins scientists on board a canadian icebreaker louis s st laurent as they scout for icebergs bears and evidence of a changing seascape across the scientific community there is a quest for answers how fast is the melt happening is it stoppable what may be lost what riches will be unlocked how much global warming is caused by people and how much by nature
838979 sea ice extent continues to decline but we have not yet seen last julys period of accelerated decline part of the explanation is that temperatures were cooler in the last two weeks of july especially north of alaska because we are past the summer solstice the amount of potential solar energy reaching the surface is waning the rate of decline should soon start to slow reducing the likelihood of breaking last years record sea ice minimum

839052 all the children of martin ramos whether legitimate or acknowledged natural lived together in hacienda ylaya during his lifetime and were under his care
839053 upon their fathers death his properties were left under the administration of rafael ramos the younger brother of their father and their uncle rafael ramos continued to administer those properties of their father giving plaintiffs money as their shares of the produce of said properties but plaintiffs not receiving any property or piece of land however until 1913 when rafael ramos gathered all the heirs including plaintiffs in the house of their father saying he would return the administration of the properties
839054 all said children defendants and plaintiffs alike continued to live in the same house of their father in hacienda ylaya now under the support of agustin ramos
839055 agustin ramos supported plaintiffs getting the money from the produce of hacienda ylaya the only source of income of agustin coming from said hacienda
839056 jose ramos gave plaintiffs also money as their shares from the products of hacienda calaza
839057 upon jose ramos death his widow gregoria ramos herself his first cousin their father and mother respectively being brother and sister continued to give plaintiffs money pertaining to their shares in the products of hacienda calaza
839058 there was never any accounting made to plaintiffs by jose ramos plaintiffs reposing confidence in their elder brother nor was any accounting made by his widow defendant gregoria ramos upon his death plaintiff manuel ramos moreover having confidence in her
839059 before the survey of these properties by the cadastral court plaintiff modesto ramos was informed by the surveying department that they were going to survey these properties
839060 plaintiffs did not know that intestate proceedings were instituted for the distribution of the estate of their father
839061 plaintiffs did not know of any proceedings of civil case no 217 they never received any sum of money in cash the alleged insignificant sum of p1 785 35 each from said alleged guardian as their supposed share in the estate of their father under any alleged project of partition
839062 neither did atanacia ramos nor her husband nestor olmedo sign any project of partition or any receipt of share in the inheritance of martin ramos in cash
839063 plaintiffs only discovered later on that the property administered by their elder brother jose had a torrens title in the name of his widow gregoria and daughter candida when plaintiff modestos children insisted and inquired from the register of deeds sometime in 1956 or 1957
839064 plaintiffs were thus constrained to bring the present suit before the court of first instance of negros occidental on september 5 1957 seeking for the reconveyance in their favor by defendants gregoria and daughter candida and husband jose bayot of their corresponding participations in said parcels of land in accordance with article 840 of the old civil code and attorneys fees in the sum of p10 000 plus costs and expenses of this litigation
839065 in its technical legal sense a trust is defined as the right enforceable solely in equity to the beneficial enjoyment of property the legal title to which is vested in another but the words trust is frequently employed to indicate duties relations and responsibilities which are not strictly technical trusts
839066 a person who establishes a trust is called the trust or one in whom confidence is reposed is known as the trustee and the person for whose benefit the trust has been created is referred to as the beneficiary
839067 trusts are either express or implied express trusts are created by the intention of the trust or of the parties implied trusts come into being by operation of law
839068 no express trusts concerning an immovable or any interest therein may be proven by oral evidence an implied trust may be proven by oral evidence
839069 no particular words are required for the creation of an express trust it being sufficient that a trust is clearly intended
839070 express trusts are those which are created by the direct and positive acts of the parties by some writing or deed or will or by words either expressly or impliedly evincing an intention to create a trust
839071 implied trust are those which without being expressed are deducible from the nature of the transaction as matters of intent or which are super induced on the transaction by operation of law as matters of equity independently of the particular intention of the parties
839072 a resulting trust is broadly defined as a trust which is raised or created by the act or construction of law but in its more restricted sense it is a trust raised by implication of law and presumed always to have been contemplated by the parties the intention as to which is to be found in the nature of their transaction but not expressed in the deed or instrument of conveyance
839073 raised by construction of law or arising by operation of law
839074 a trust not created by any words either expressly or impliedly evincing a direct intention to create a trust but by the construction of equity in order to satisfy the demands of justice it does not arise by agreement or intention but by operation of law
839075 if a person obtains legal title to property by fraud or concealment courts of equity will impress upon the title a so called constructive trust in favor of the defrauded party
839076 in any case the partition was given the stamp of judicial approval and as a matter of principle and policy we should sustain its regularity in the absence of such cause or reason that the law itself fixes as a ground for invalidity
839077 as the administration proceedings ended in the year 1916 the guardianship proceedings in 1931 and the action was brought only in the year 1948 more than 32 years from the time of the distribution and 27 years from the termination of guardianship proceedings
839078 if eternal vigilance is the price of safety one cannot sleep on ones right for more than a tenth of a century and except it to be preserved in its pristine purity
839079 it is the judicial decree of distribution once final that vests title in the distributees
839080 if that decree of distribution was erroneous or not in conformity with law or the testament the same should have been corrected by opportune appeal but once it had become final its binding effect is like that of any other judgment in rem unless properly set aside for lack of jurisdiction or fraud
839081 the fact that one of the distributees was a minor at the time the court issued the decree of distribution does not imply that the court had no jurisdiction to enter the decree of distribution
839082 a final order of distribution of the estate of a deceased person vests the title to the land of the estate in the distributes
839083 the adverse result of an action does not per se make the act wrongful and subject the actor to the payment of moral damages the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to litigate such right is so precious that moral damages may not be charged on those who may exercise it erroneously
839084 in case of a clearly unfounded civil action or proceeding against the plaintiff
839085 in any other cases where the court deems it just and equitable

839320 the available monitoring data on himalayan glaciers indicates while some recession of glaciers has occurred in some himalayan regions in recent years the trend is not consistent across the entire mountain chain it is accordingly too early to establish long term trends or their causation in respect of which there are several hypotheses
839321 there is a significant warm bias nighttime temperatures that is not accounted for by the ipcc and their global temperature trend assessments i would assume he is talking about the increase in urbanization the heat island effect which is most pronounced at night

839326 the term muckraker most associated with a group of american investigative reporters novelists and critics from the late 1800s to early 1900s who investigated and exposed societal issues such as conditions in slums and prisons factories insane asylums as they were called at the time sweatshops mines child labor and unsanitary conditions in food processing plants

839328 global warming increases the probability of floods and strong hurricanes and that is all you can say
839329 no matter what we did to the data it does not show any meaningful statistical significance

839331 were sitting on the edge of what could be a major energy resource
839332 brett isnt it time you updated the global temperature anomalies map you have on the main global warming page 2004 2006 its a bit misleading as the situation has changed quite a bit since then dont you think
839333 so why is the first year ice thicker than anticipated sparse snow cover last winter may have hastened its growth less snow on the ice means less insulation from the frigid winter air and faster ice growth much of the snowfall over the arctic ocean occurs in early autumn but early last autumn much of the arctic ocean was still ice free and could not collect snow once the ice formed it grew quickly

839336 because they cant tax and regulate water vapor and use its taxation and regulation to establish more government control over your life
839337 interesting but not really meaningful co2 is still a trace gas with no scientifically established relationship to climate why do these studies ignore the most important greenhouse gas water vapor and devote so much effort and energy to monitoring co2
839338 on this issue it can be shown with a simple climate model that small cloud fluctuations assumed to occur with two modes of natural climate variability the el nino la nina phenomenon southern oscillation and the pacific decadal oscillation can explain 70 of the warming trend since 1900 as well as the nature of that trend warming until the 1940s no warming until the 1970s and resumed warming since then
839339 humans create the majority of airborne soot through industry and fuel combustion while forest and open field fires account for the rest because of human activity greenhouse gas levels have increased by one third in the last two centuries

839350 nearly 20 sq km eight sq miles of ice from the ward hunt shelf has split away from ellesmere island according to satellite pictures it is thought to be the biggest piece of ice shed in the region since 60 sq km of the nearby ayles ice shelf broke away in 2005 the polar north is once again experiencing a rapid ice retreat this year although many scientists doubt the record minimum extent of 4 13 million sq km 1 59 million sq miles of sea ice seen in 2007 will be beaten radiocarbon dating of driftwood trapped behind the shelf in disraeli fjord shows the shelf itself has been in place for at least 3 000 years researchers believe the mechanism which has maintained its stability fresh water coming out of disraeli fjord and freezing under the shelf may have been disturbed if that is the case the rest of the whis may disappear quite rapidly researchers say further loss of arctic ice will see radiation absorbed by darker seawater and snow free land potentially warming the earths climate at an even faster rate than current observational data indicates
839351 starting in the 1970s however the arctic oscillation has tended to stay in the positive phase causing lower than normal arctic air pressure and higher than normal temperatures in much of the united states and northern eurasia
839352 the 90 degree streak record continues to be broken as of today august 2nd the temperature at the denver international airport peaked at 103 degrees a new high temperature record for august 2nd and thus moved the total 90 degree streak number up to 21 consecutive days note prior to 2008 the old record of eighteen 90 degree days in a row was last set in 1901 and was originally set way back in 1874

839369 looks like global warming is being accurately referred to as siberia warming
839370 since global temps are based on an average of local temps across the globe it would seem obvious that without siberia temps in the majority of places have decreased
839371 this would clearly account for the many colder zones throughout the year while warming is supposedly prevalent
839372 now the real issue is why siberia is warming at such an alarming rate
839373 seems to me that scientists would produce more beneficial work by studying real warming in a specific area instead of theorizing why warming exists in areas that temps have been forced by a generalized average analysis
839374 the polar regions are expected to warm more than the temperate and tropical zones regardless of the cause of the warming
839375 now how does this warming differ from the warming in the early part of the 20th century the mwp or the roman warm period in none of those cases did the world climate reach a tipping point is there any reason to believe if global warming resumes it will be any different
839376 before everyone clamors to criticize the 0 8c temperature increase in the past 100 years in that chart i refer you to the cru temperature graph
839377 gosh it feels like it rose 6 degree guess ill take off my sweater
839378 i think that we are seeing a slow down in global temperature rise due to actions nations have been taking to reduce their carbon emissions
839379 gas flaring from siberian oil fields dumps huge amounts of soot on the snow shouldnt the positive anomalies be smaller or non existent in the summer when all the snow is usually melted anyway
839380 paulm i think that we are seeing a slow down in global temperature rise due to actions nations have been taking to reduce their carbon emissions
839381 it is our belief that loehles curve is by far the superior of the two in terms of the degree to which it likely approximates the truth

839388 there is no significant land anywhere around the world at the latitudes of the drake passage which is important to the unimpeded flow of the antarctic circumpolar current which carries a huge volume of water about 600 times the flow of the amazon river through the passage and around antarctica
839389 the passage is known to have been closed until around 41 million years ago according to a chemical study of fish teeth found in oceanic sedimentary rock before the passage opened the atlantic and pacific oceans were separated entirely with antarctica being much warmer and having no ice cap the joining of the two great oceans started the antarctic circumpolar current and cooled the continent significantly
839390 the paleocene eocene boundary 55 8 million years ago was marked by the most rapid and significant climatic disturbance of the cenozoic era
839391 the event saw global temperatures rise by around 6c over 20 000 years with a corresponding rise in sea level as the whole of the oceans warmed atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentrations rose causing a shallowing of the lysocline
839392 enough solar energy hits the earths surface in forty minutes to power the entire world for a year
839393 the burden of proof lies with those who suggest massive policy changes based on an unproven hypothesis not with those who are skeptical of it
839394 anon steve m carefully chooses issues that he believes he can argue endlessly hes just sort of uninterested in other things imagine that
839395 this is too warm to be the antarctic water we know today
839396 and the seawater chemistry shows there was little or no ice on the planet
839397 because the fossils are so well preserved they provide more accurate temperature records
839398 our findings demonstrate that the water temperature these creatures lived in was much warmer than previous records have shown
839399 although we did not measure carbon dioxide several studies suggest that greenhouse gases forty million years ago were similar to those levels that are forecast for the end of this century and beyond
839400 our work provides another piece of evidence that in a time period with relatively high carbon dioxide levels temperatures were higher and ice sheets were much smaller and likely to have been completely absent
839401 we are left with the prospect that what has been termed our best known analogue to earths modern glaciation is in fact poorly known
839402 this study is an example of the wealth of untapped climate information stored in earths deep time geologic record millions of years ago
839403 these kinds of discoveries may greatly improve our understanding and prediction of modern climate change
839404 why is it so difficult to get climate policies passed
839405 ice free pole for the first time in human history
839406 when i was told that it was possible that the film maker might try to portray himself as the
839407 an optimist sees an opportunity in every calamity a pessimist sees a calamity in every opportunity
839408 the film tried to pretend that kyoto is a conspiracy by the west to prevent the developing world from developing despite the fact that the developing world has no emissions reductions targets under kyoto look up kyoto in any good online encyclopedia
839409 as i say i could list more than 100 similar distortions obviously there isnt room here but the online encyclopedia article on the film links to many good articles by others who document many of them
839410 this fact is well documented and is in the public domain it is not controversial for instance look up the contributors names and exxon in a search engine for some of the details
839411 this lack of disclosure of conflicts of interest is particularly important because of the overwhelming evidence that has come to light see for instance the union of concerned scientists website that some sections of the fossil fuel industry together with the lobby groups that they fund have been running a very well funded misinformation campaign to reduce public support for cutting greenhouse gas emissions
839412 furthermore the credentials of all of the interviewees in the subjects that they discussed in the film were exaggerated some of them grossly so only three of the contributors could by any stretch of the imagination be called leading climate scientists and one of those three carl wunsch has stated publicly that the film misrepresented his views on both climate change and on modeling through selective editing and use of context to make him appear to the audience to be saying the precise opposite of what he was actually trying to convey
839413 there is all the difference in the world between expressing opinions and fraud this film falls into the category of fraud
839414 if you really want to learn about the science of global warming a good place to start is any of the online encyclopedias
839415 opposition to global warming and sustainability solutions has been well organized making up for their lack of good arguments and valid science
839416 why is it so difficult to get climate policies passed
839417 unfortunately the day you will have to buy bottled water and refrain from breathing outside air because it will be too thick it will be too late
839418 the first 20 ppm of co2 is as effective as the next 400 ppm
839419 well just think what will happen when agw rears its head
839420 i know this is a judgment on your part but how would you classify the massive and well orchestrated campaign in favor of anthropogenic co2 induced global warming
839421 and recall if you can the frightening stories about how legislation to control acid rain or cfcs would lead to intolerable costs shortages and economic chaos gee somehow we missed all of that although retooling most of our energy systems is much more complicated those examples provide some guide to what is possible
839422 reasonable case for action given the likelihood of a great consequence
839423 and recall if you can the frightening stories about how legislation to control acid rain or cfcs would lead to intolerable costs shortages and economic chaos
839424 i understand most conservatives regard themselves as christians but am at a loss to find where jesus told us to take from the poor and give to the rich id suggest a rereading of the sermon on the mount
839425 paulm veets even bush is saying were having problems with oil supplies wow he even said the the us was addicted to it sounds like panic stations in the whitehouse running out of oil is a big problem and an expensive one to say the least how did us in this dilemma
839426 the remote sensing systems rss satellite derived data put june 2008 as the 13th coolest on their record going back to 1979
839427 kipp alpert john galt if you could cherry pick your data you would china is making the bulk of solar panels today wake up your war is over
839428 as people worldwide increasingly feel the heat of climate change many are applauding the skyrocketing growth china s fledging solar cell industry
839429 a recent washington post article however has revealed that china s booming solar industry is not as green as one might expect
839430 polysilicon is a key component of the sunlight capturing wafers used in solar photovoltaic pv cells
839431 the post article describes how luoyang zhonggui a major chinese polysilicon manufacturer is dumping toxic factory waste directly on to the lands of neighboring villages killing crops and poisoning residents
839432 technologies exist to recycle the chemical byproducts of solar cell production but some chinese polysilicon plants including luoyang zhonggui are cutting costs and corners by avoiding significant extra investment in pollution control the cheaper prices of their products which do not currently factor in environmental costs are projected to fan the rapid expansion of chinese made solar pv systems around the world especially in industrial countries that can afford the still expensive units
839433 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
839434 opinions expressed are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of the aps or of the forum
839435 dont believe a word of it just a few days ago the university of alabama huntsville came out with their global assessment and they reported the 22nd warmest in the 30 years of records in their data base in other words the 9th coldest in fact their global mean was actually below the average base period 1979 1998 with a value of 0 11c 0 19f this is a full 1 1f degrees colder than the noaa guesstimate
839436 who do these people represent strange dude here is the position from the american institute of physics isnt it strange the way reality always kills a lie
839437 i like the choice of 1961 1990 as a baseline on the noaa scary red dot map this reference time period was otherwise known as the global cooling scare because it had anomalously cold temperatures
839438 all scientists agree that global warming is going to lead us to a horrible fiery death except for the large number of scientists who dont believe that man made global warming even exists and the remainder who recognize that the
839439 now that al gore has successfully invented the internet he should devote his attention to inventing a energy source which can free us from all our wordly troubles during the next ten years and make everyone on earth happy like from that lovely scene in bambi where the skunks and fawns are all romping happily together in the sunshine
839440 ok so reporting stations have dropped from 6000 to 2000
839441 the other nasa satellite source rss had june as the 13th coldest out of the last 30 years
839442 i am also preparing a hypothesis that shows that natural variability can account for the warming the earth has experienced over the last 200 years to present to the aps well see if professional agw advocates can break it
839443 though there has clearly been some cyclical warming in recent decades the global surface station based data is seriously compromised by urbanization and other local factors land use land cover improper siting station dropout instrument changes unaccounted for and missing data and thus the data bases overestimate the warming
839444 peer review is an integral component of scientific research and publishing it allows the scientific community to maintain quality control of research through the review of research proposals journal manuscripts and other reports academic peer review although far from perfect is the best tool scientists have to ensure high standards for their professional work
839445 these types of reviews are critically important tools for policy makers they allow experts from both inside and outside the federal government to provide technical advice and analysis increasing public confidence in federal science and ensuring that the best quality information is used in decision making
839446 however it is critical that scientific peer review programs be carefully designed to maintain objectivity quality and thoroughness while scientific peer review is an important tool for decision makers a poorly designed process can do more harm than good
839447 joseph daleo was the first director of meteorology at the cable tv weather channel
839448 joseph daleo is a graduate of the university of wisconsin bs ms and was in the doctoral program at nyu
839449 mr daleos areas of expertise include climatology natural factors involved in climate change weather and climate prediction and north atlantic oscillation nao
839450 one of the things that troubles me most is that the rapid fire publication of unsettled results in highly visible venues creates the impression that the scientific community has no idea what s going on
839451 each new paper negates or repudiates something emphatically asserted in a previous paper
839452 the public is obviously picking up on this not as an evolution of objective scientific understanding but as a proliferation of contradictory opinions
839453 she said the news media sometimes overplayed the uncertainty by balancing opposing views in a story without characterizing the overall level of confidence in either side and sometimes they do the opposite sacrificing accuracy for impact she said
839454 the auroras surged westward twice as fast as anyone thought possible crossing 15 degrees of longitude in less than one minute the storm traversed an entire polar time zone or 400 miles in 60 seconds flat
839455 the satellites have found evidence of magnetic ropes connecting earths upper atmosphere directly to the sun
839456 we believe that solar wind particles flow in along these ropes providing energy for geomagnetic storms and auroras
839457 changes in the sun can account for major climate changes on earth for the past 300 years including part of the recent surge of global warming
839458 were not saying that variations in solar activity account for all of the global rise in temperature that we are experiencing
839459 but we believe these variations are the major driving force heat trapping gases emitted by smokestacks and vehicles the so called greenhouse effect appear to be secondary
839460 you guys should scale back the rhetoric and start working together more in order to keep your story straight because we are starting to lose them
839461 these questions endure even as the basic theory of a rising human influence on climate has steadily solidified accumulating greenhouse gases will warm the world erode ice sheets raise seas and have big impacts on biology and human affairs
839462 i wonder if this blog is partially guilty of this
839463 suzuki and gore should have lived in old testament times i figures when you prophesied back then in hebrew land you had to deliver or you would get a free ticket to a very painful sort of rock concert where you were both the star and would also soon be seeing stars
839464 the public is obviously picking up on this not as an evolution of objective scientific understanding but as a proliferation of contradictory opinions
839465 something that was agreed to be scientific fact today may be proven otherwise tomorrow by continued scientific study
839466 i do think we grew more sensitive to the need for critical review of papers likely to initiate or continue the kind of controversy that results in a whiplash effect
839467 al gore places infant son in rocket to escape dying planet
839468 with a warmer atmoshpere maybe the heat transfer mechanism has changed the predominate type of cloud storm
839469 environmentalism has replaced socialism as the leading secular religion and the ethics of environmentalism are fundamentally sound scientists and economists can agree with buddhist monks and christian activists that ruthless destruction of natural habitats is evil and careful preservation of birds and butterflies is good the worldwide community of environmentalists most of whom are not scientists holds the moral high ground and is guiding human societies toward a hopeful future unfortunately some members of the environmental movement have also adopted as an article of faith the belief that global warming is the greatest threat to the ecology of our planet that is one reason why the arguments about global warming have become bitter and passionate much of the public has come to believe that anyone who is skeptical about the dangers of global warming is an enemy of the environment the skeptics now have the difficult task of convincing the public that the opposite is true many of the skeptics are passionate environmentalists they are horrified to see the obsession with global warming distracting public attention from what they see as more serious and more immediate dangers to the planet including problems of nuclear weaponry environmental degradation and social injustice whether they turn out to be right or wrong their arguments on these issues deserve to be heard
839470 the focus on climate research over the last 15 20 years have resulted in an increased awareness that climate is not as constant as it may have appeared previously in this context even the most extreme and divergent forecasts of future climate may have done some good this is however a situation that should not continue much longer as it confuse and disillusionate political decision makers and the general public about the value of so called climate experts in addition the initial humble scientific attempts of modelling the future climate have now developed into a large scale example of groupthink with its own dynamics tending to hinder any unbiased political approach to the climate issue the difficulty of recognition of a new climatic trend or a lasting change is real and constitutes an important difficulty for both scientist and policy makers the immediate need for climate scientists is to improve empirical knowledge on climate change past and present and to understand the limitations of the different types of approach to forecasting climate for the decision makers the lesson presumably is to allow wider margins for future climatic change cooler as well as warmer wetter as well as drier windier as well as less windy etc preparing for warming only may not be entirely prudent climate science remains a highly complex issue where simplification tends to lead to confusion and where understanding requires knowledge openness to new hypotheses thought and effort reason and critical thinking should now as always have first priority
839471 hey patrick maybe what drives the number of severe weather events is the atmospheres delta t since the earths atmospheres temp increased since 1970 the delta temp has decreased with a warmer atmoshpere maybe the heat transfer mechanism has changed the predominate type of cloud storm
839472 ocean cycles volcanic aerosols and the phenomenological solar signal versus the instrument temperature record
839473 sea surface temperatures are heating up above average temperatures in all oceans as predicted by general circulation models the northern hemisphere oceans are heating up the most
839474 arctic sea ice is below the 1979 to 2000 mean
839475 albedo size and lack of an atmosphere to retain heat
839476 not much water in the venusian atmosphere but nearly as much as earths atmosphere at any given moment why while water vapor is only about 01 of the venusian atmosphere the venusian atmosphere is 92 times the density of the earths
839477 but that causation has nothing to do with the earths atmosphere we are at 380 ppm co2 with pressure at 1 atmosphere at sea level and 1365 w m 2 venus is at 965 000 ppm co2 with pressure at 92 atm and 2600w m 2
839478 the venusian atmosphere has always been a nightmare there was no runaway greenhouse effect
839479 there is 213 000 times as much co2 in the venus atmosphere as is in our atmosphere that is 160 000 000 000 000 000 tons 965 000 ppm as compared to 750 000 000 000 tons 380 ppm here on earth
839480 there is little to gain from comparing planetary climates especially when there are so many differences tsi atmosphere density and composition albedo etc
839481 i dont follow you dennis an atmosphere that is receiving twice the tsi as earth is 965 000 ppm co2 is at 92 atm and that allows you to take tsi and water vapor out of the earths greenhouse effect
839482 a comparison of two very different thermodynamic systems cannot be applied to a third and also very different system in an attempt to explain cooling
839483 you cannot take a heat source out of any picture when dealing with a thermodynamic system especially when that heat source is 99 99999 tsi of the heat applied to the system
839484 temperature is a measurement of energy based upon the properties of the substance the lower the specific heat the higher the temp with an equal amount of energy
839485 co2 is 846 h2o vapor 2 1 and water 4 2
839486 the cooling mechanism for the four inner planets are all very different you cannot take a climate phenomena from one planet and easily apply it to another let alone attempt to make a prediction
839487 its warming and co2 is increasing in the atmosphere co2 is a greenhouse gas and is therefore causing the warming human civilization burns fossil fuels and this combustion emits co2 therefore global warming is man made
839488 global warming is due to human co2 emissions do no such thing
839489 that there is no convincing evidence that co2 emissions from modern industrial activity has in the past is now or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change
839490 the nasa article states that these ocean current changes over a span of decades could be part of a natural cycle or indicate the beginning of a long term change in a current as a result of human induced climate change they are just not sure yet
839491 if you can provide irrefutable evidence that anthropogenic co2 is the cause of global warming over the last 150 years or for that matter the last 30 years by all means do so
839492 based on a database of documented responses in physical and biological systems from 1970 to 2004 temperature related changes have been observed in all continents
839493 saudi arabia announces they will increase oil production by 1 2 billion barrels per day
839494 iraq announces theyre ready to have more oil produced brazil discovers 33 billion barrels off their coast
839495 because the demand is still greater than the amount produced
839496 because you dont understand simple economics because of your anti capitalism hate speech
839497 drilling will make us energy independent so we dont have to pay people who hate us for their imported oil
839498 because whether you like it or not the greatest nation on the face of the earth the united states of america produces more and basically fuels the world
839499 tell us what the price of gas is in those countries
839500 having said that can you explain why over the last decade that despite steadily increasing co2 concentrations that the so called global temperature has been declining
839501 those of us who are pro growth such as myself
839502 drilling our oil reserves which contain only 3 of the worlds supply
839503 simply put the rest of the world doesnt care what we do
839504 because you dont understand simple economics because of your anti capitalism hate speech
839505 drilling will make us energy independent so we dont have to pay people who hate us for their imported oil
839506 because whether you like it or not the greatest nation on the face of the earth the united states of america produces more and basically fuels the world
839507 tell us what the price of gas is in those countries
839508 as for rss and uah temps see here and here looks to me as though the temps have been declining since 1998 at a rate of 0 001 c decade i guess well have to wait and see what kind of temperatures the future will bring
839509 how do you know it is specifically due to co2 wouldnt any sufficiently dense atmosphere have a similar effect
839510 global warming has the climate sensitivity holy grail been found
839511 artic sea ice is below normal not clear if we will see another record low but the north pole be could ice free
839512 sea levels are continuing to rise and extreme precipition sic events are becoming more common
839513 when youre weak on the facts attack the law when youre weak on the law attack the facts when youre weak on both attack the person
839514 it is of no little significance that the ipccs value for the coefficient in the co2 forcing equation depends on only one paper in the literature that its values for the feedbacks that it believes account for two thirds of humankinds effect on global temperatures are likewise taken from only one paper and that its implicit value of the crucial parameter k depends upon only two papers one of which had been written by a lead author of the chapter in question and neither of which provides any theoretical or empirical justification for a value as high as that which the ipcc adopted
839515 if we thought there was an ice age coming due say to the natural cycle could humans warm up the climate to keep the comfortable status quo
839516 nxp went to court to protect themselves from the painful reality that their chip is flawed instead of doing all they could to resolve the problem and as a result many of their users find themselves having to review their security procedures the similarities to arguments about free expression are not mere coincidence of course shouting bug on a crowded internet is just as dangerous as shouting fire in a crowded theatre even in societies where free speech is valued and protected by law and we should not assume that full disclosure is always the right way forward
839517 saudi arabia announces they will increase production by 1 2 billion barrels per day oil price goes up iraq announces theyre ready to have more oil produced guess what oil prices go up brazil discovers 33 billion barrels off their coast more than three times bigger than anwr and guess what oil prices went up up up the next day what makes you think pumping anwr or offshore is going to decrease prices hahaha what a joke coming to a museum near you the hummer ha
839518 there has been no change in alaska temperatures over the last 30 years
839519 what happens when the government implements huge tax cuts and then goes on a spending spree anyone the deficit grows larger the government prints more money the value of the dollar drops prices go up the fed lowers interest rates to compensate the value of the dollar drops even more prices rise even more we end up with stagflation
839520 the climate is not responding to the lower sunspot numbers co2 warming confirmed
839521 actually the exact opposite happens cutting taxes puts more money into peoples pockets so the spend make more and the governments revenue goes up
839522 if anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of global climate why are they overridden by changes in solar irradiance and by ocean oscillations
839523 a second larger anthropogenic signal 10 to 20 resulted from the reduction of air pollution from the late 1970s to around 2000 and since the air is as clean as its going to get this part of the warming has ended
839524 recent studies have attributed up to 94 of arctic melt to dirty ice and snow
839525 humans create the majority of airborne soot through industry and fuel combustion while forest and open field fires account for the rest because of human activity greenhouse gas levels have increased by one third in the last two centuries
839526 last of course i agree that man contributes to climate change
839527 if this is so true whay has oil dropped since the
839528 the atmosphere could get cleaner if you continue to reduce and or eliminate the oil fuel combustion sources that contribute the majority of soot dust and ghg that based on the article link to by ph that states is causing the arctic sea ice melt unless you eliminate those emissions the arctic sea ice will continue to melt and the ocean temperature will rise further due to the decrease in albedo in the northern latitudes
839529 veet may be they do charge more for red one thing for sure is they put their money where there mouth is and they tend to stay on top of the game
839530 about 75 of the recent price increases in oil can be attributed to may 2007 july 2008 devaluation of the dollar
839531 and you still havent come clean and told this blog what kind of vehicle it is you drive
839532 the red and the blue curves in the scafetta and west paper are not tsi or sunspot number they are phenomenological solar signal pss curves they represent the climatic temperature response to two different satellite tsi composites acrim and pmod the pmod tsi composite flattens after 1950 while the acrim rises
839533 since 1975 global warming has occurred much faster than could be reasonably expected from the sun alone
839534 in fact the much touted increase of 0 04 decade is based on using only the values at the first two arrows but it s evident that this does not tell the whole story if one starts at the beginning and ends at the ending then the trend identified would be distinctly decreasing rather than increasing that s due to the very high maximum of cycle 21 in the acrim composite a better idea would be to fit a trend line to the residuals which yields a slope of 0 01 w m 2 yr or 0 1 w m 2 decade this does indeed represent an upward slope but the rate is nowhere near the 0 04 decade touted by willson amp mordvinov it s a mere 0 008 decade if that trend were sustained throughout the 28 year duration of the data it would lead to a net secular increase in tsi of 0 31 w m 2 which would cause an increase in climate forcing of 0 076 w m 2 that s only marginally bigger than the climate forcing due to anthropogenic power generation at a climate sensitivity of 0 75 deg c w m 2 it would lead to a net global temperature rise of 0 06 deg c far smaller than what is observed even using the acrim composite satellite estimates of tsi will not support the idea that tsi changes are responsible for modern global warming
839535 my view has some minor differences i believe there are long term oscillations in sst driven by solar irradiance and by sulfur aerosols released from explosive volcanic eruptions that are colossal in scale these eruptions severely limit solar irradiance for short periods of time a few years and drop sst and subsurface ocean temperatures the sst oscillations vary in amplitude and frequency on the order of decades centuries and millennia driven by thc moc each containing a portion of those major perturbations and other changes in forcings most times the sst oscillations are out of phase at others the oscillations are synchronized amplifying one another the changes in sst vary the amount of natural greenhouse gases water vapor and carbon dioxide which further amplify the change in sst lsts are driven directly by changes in sst solar irradiance and volcanic aerosols and indirectly by the variations in natural greenhouse gases caused by the oscillations in sst underlying that is a minor 2 to 5 anthropogenic signal which includes greenhouse gases uhi land use changes etc a second larger anthropogenic signal 10 to 20 resulted from the reduction of air pollution from the late 1970s to around 2000 and since the air is as clean as its going to get this part of the warming has ended
839536 fourth ive never said the solar contribution accounted for all of the recent rise in temperature ive always said el ninos the amo the north pacific residual and volcanic aerosols account for most of the rest
839537 we re burning oil in ways that destroy the planet
839538 27 senior statesmen and retired military leaders warned of the national security threat from an energy tsunami that would be triggered by a loss of our access to foreign oil
839539 i don t remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
839540 should we or should we not follow the advice of the galacticly stupid
839541 the way to bring gas prices down is to end our dependence on oil and use the renewable sources that can give us the equivalent of one dollar per gallon gasoline
839542 according to scientists enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
839543 there is a considerable presence within the scientific community of people who do not agree with the ipcc conclusion that anthropogenic co2 emissions are very probably likely to be primarily responsible for the global warming that has occurred since the industrial revolution
839544 offer s up pragmatic realistic goals for our energy security and future
839545 only about 13 percent of land worldwide is windy enough for wind power installations to be economical assuming that we can cover that fraction of the land with 1 5 mw 80 meter tall turbines the wind power potential turns out to be 72 terawatt tw one tw is 1 000 gw and 1 gw is the size of a modern coal fired power plant consequently the worlds wind potential is equivalent to 72 000 new coal plants which corresponds to 35 times the global electricity demand and 6 times the earths total energy demand which also includes heating transportation and other energy
839546 due to its relatively shallow continental shelf the east coast of the united states has an offshore wind power potential of 330 gw
839547 do as i say not as i do gores ideas are a fast track to collapsing the us economy
839548 gore has lost a lot of weight turned his nashville house into a energy conservation showcase and mostly flies commercial jets
839549 not surprisingly the skeptics have received significant funding from coal and oil companies including exxonmobil
839550 railroads and stage coach lines hated the automobiles because they did not want competition
839551 the car began life as a rich mans toy rather than a means of transport or as an instrument of social change
839552 i do like gores idea of reducing if not eliminating payroll taxes but his carbon tax idea will be laughed at within a year since co2 as a contributor to gw will be found to be false
839553 how do you figure that it will be found false within the year
839554 heres a challenge for gore practice what you preach reply from what i read he is doing that now
839555 only about 13 percent of land worldwide is windy enough for wind power installations to be economical assuming that we can cover that fraction of the land with 1 5 mw 80 meter tall turbines the wind power potential turns out to be 72 terawatt tw one tw is 1 000 gw and 1 gw is the size of a modern coal fired power plant consequently the worlds wind potential is equivalent to 72 000 new coal plants which corresponds to 35 times the global electricity demand and 6 times the earths total energy demand which also includes heating transportation and other energy
839556 change the terms of the global warming debate by focusing on investment
839557 i suspect once the emphasis switches to renewable engergy sources the price of fossil fuels will drop to the point of making renewable energy sources the hight cost form of energy
839558 a more serious barrier to large scale implementation of wind power than concerns about aesthetics or bird kills is the intermittency of winds it is possible to experience sudden unexpected changes in wind speed such as gusts or lulls this means that wind power as a reliable source of electricity has some problems one way to reduce wind power swings is interconnected power by linking multiple wind farms together it is possible to improve the overall performance of the interconnected system or array substantially compared with that of any individual wind farm the idea is that while wind speed could be calm at a given location it will be active somewhere else in the aggregate array so there can be a constant flow of power outward from the entire system if the farms are all interconnected spain one of the worlds leaders in wind power production has created a system in which sudden wind power swings are eliminated during a particularly windy period in the spring of 2007 wind power in spain contributed 27 percent of the nations electricity more than coal nuclear energy or hydropower another problem of wind power is its temporal mismatch with the electricity demand the winds are often weakest when the electricity demand is highest such as during a heat wave one solution to this is pumped hydroelectric storage during periods when there is high production from the wind and low demand for example at night the excess electricity is used to pump water from a reservoir located at low altitude to a second higher reservoir subsequently during times of high demand for example in the afternoon water from the higher reservoir is released to generate electricity and complement the winds reduced generation similarly the winds excess electricity can be used at night to compress air into a cavern below a wind farm the compressed air is then run through a traditional turbine to generate electricity during high demand hours on a small scale a network of car batteries from electric or plug in vehicles connected to the grid can provide emergency backup electricity
839559 president bushs cabinet agreed in april 2001 that iraq remains a destabilizing influence to the flow of oil to international markets from the middle east and because this is an unacceptable risk to the us military intervention is necessary
839560 regardless of whether we say so publicly we will go to war because saddam sits at the center of a region with more than 60 percent of all the worlds oil reserves
839561 many people would have a lower tax burden under gores plan
839562 of course it escapes the right wingers here that gore wants to enact a tax structure that they in the past have supported that being reducing taxes on earned income payroll tax and replacing it with a consumption tax in this case a carbon tax i thought getting rid of taxes on what you earn and instead taxing only what you consume is what conservatives want if newt gingrich delivered this message and called the carbon tax by some other name right wingers would support it
839563 of course it never actually occured to you that the reason pickens along with a rapidly growing number of corporate executivies are supporting green energy is because in the long term it makes the most economic sense
839564 give me a break the guy is 80 years old and when he dies his money is all going to charity of course it never actually occured to you that the reason pickens along with a rapidly growing number of corporate executivies are supporting green energy is because in the long term it makes the most economic sense

839590 how much experience have you had in the past with horses
839591 the kid stood there for the entire hour crying waiting for him to pick his head up
839592 she expected everyone to take care of her and she expected the horse to know what she wanted

839650 it was a surprise that we werent as quick as we should have been and that i wasnt as fast behind felipe
839651 i had no warning of the puncture its nowhere near as bad as it could have been we could have had felipe and kimi in front heikki did a good job and glock was second which took points off kimi which is good

839662 do you think that tailored dressing will ever really work for a generation of women used to throwing on their clothes
839663 i do because ive seen with my own eyes the transformation that happens when you take a girl out of her baby doll and her flip flops and dress her in a beautifully tailored suit its revolutionary its like suddenly she gets it clothes are supposed to fit and the bonus is if you start dressing that way when youre young in 20 years everyone will say you havent aged a day

839674 ramona why is the declaration of independence taped to your duck pillow
839675 i have struggled with my weight for my whole life and pregnancy obviously does crazy things to you
839676 so when my daughter was 3 months old i looked for a place she could be with me when i got in shape i never thought i could enjoy exercising
839677 my baby loves it near the end of the class we put the kids on a big mat where they can play together and interact
839678 my husband accepted a new job and we moved from baton rouge la where i was attending strollerfit
839679 i checked to see if there were any classes in this area and i couldnt find anything so i decided to open one myself
839680 we meet the needs of all fitness levels and incorporate music nursery rhymes and games into class to make it fun for both mom and baby
839681 strollerfit is a total body workout while building your mommy muscles you are also incorporating cardio strength and resistance
839682 the faster someone burns off the extra weight that most new moms carry the better but they should increase their activity level gradually
839683 if exercise isnt hurting you you can do almost anything that doesnt produce pain

839687 hey stiennon wrote something lets jump all over that you hit him low and ill throw my margarita is his face
839688 interestingly i found the security sections weak for many of the same high level reasons he listed in his review of the cis benchmark
839689 vmware esx server in the enterprise planning and securing virtualization servers
839690 this provides unbreakable security since only authorized applications can attempt to gain access to hyperventilated memory space which is also encrypted to prevent unauthorized access
839691 hyperboles unique patent pending hyperspatial update and subscription service allows the near instantaneous transfer of new heuristics for attack detection before knowledge of these attacks can arrive
839692 inevitable that network security will eventually be subsumed into the network fabric
839693 inevitable that network security will eventually be subsumed into the network fabric
839694 typical rant coming from the ex analyst side and all it does is increase the resentment and disdain for those who dont get it
839695 while criminals more often came from external sources and insider attacks result in the greatest losses criminals at or via partner connections actually represent the greatest risk this is due to our risk equation threat x impact risk external criminals pose the greatest threat 73 but achieve the least impact 30 000 compromised records resulting in a psuedo risk score of 21 900 insiders pose the least threat 18 and achieve the greatest impact 375 000 compromised records resulting in a pseudo risk score of 67 500 partners are middle in both 73 39 and 187 500 resulting in a pseudo risk score of 73 125
839696 thus a back of the napkin calculation of risk likelihood x impact finds that partners represent the greatest risk for data compromise followed closely by insiders
839697 and its widely known that 80 percent of attacks are from insiders
839698 i know this conversation is supposed to be about rainbows and unicorns but the internet is horribly horribly broken
839699 security is like bellbottoms every 20 years or so the same funny looking kit comes back into style
839700 should be avoided at all costs because they imply the inviolability of the hypervisor at any level from the virtual networking to the kernel something that nor vmware neither any other virtualization vendor can grant
839701 in a way i think i understand exactly where alessandro is coming from even if i dont completely agree with him or at least i partially do
839702 as shown in figures 1 and 2 the introduction of virtual technology into a dmz does not have to change the dmz topology significantly
839703 yeah but these are basically the same views someone might get looking at a firewall ids or ips tool today
839704 you might argue thats right except we already know that server and virtualization administrators as well as most network folk dont have access to those tools
839705 tutorials are also aimed at educating technical people on the different aspects of security for virtual environments to hopefully help them ask vendors to provide solutions in the right areas and figure out what areas they already have the solutions in
839706 security teams do not generally patch configure deploy or modify infrastructure although they may inform audit and monitor the infrastructure
839707 the security guys often have no idea whats going on inside the host environment
839708 you can work on the firewall routers with the networking group or you can join security to implement ids ips which is it
839709 we can detect credit card numbers in email yeah that s only a fraction of requirement 4 oops and sorry about the other 11 requirements for which we do nothing
839710 twenty is the number and the number shall be twenty
839711 the information wants to be free somebody was gonna do it anyway
839712 less than 10 of the users of metasploit use the tool for criminal purposes
839713 i argued and was ultimately argued with that googles 625m purchase of postini was just the beginning
839714 clean pipes service to the consumer dont forget utility services that recent acquisitions such as grandcentral and feedburner provide its too bad that ebay snatched up skype
839715 provides real time malware protection and url filtering with policy enforcement and reporting an additional feature extends the same protections to users working remotely on laptops in hotels cafes and even guest networks
839716 wow hmm ok now what does this really contain product wise and what does it entail
839717 who is this guy anyway think before you type dude were not idiots
839718 there is nothing more abhorrent than a vested interest masquerading as a moral principal
839719 the industry has already decided a long time ago that third party vendors are required to secure any platform
839720 i dont think that we are competent to be a security vendor
839721 the industry has already decided a long time ago that third party vendors are required to secure any platform
839722 if only reducing costs was as easy as security say cios
839723 about the constituent control deployments in host and network licenses and the residual operational impact from an fte perspective and hardware amp software license costs
839724 the attack vectors for a combination of virtualised operating systems and applications are identical to those of the physical system
839725 yes that happens to me all the time and its annoying
839726 oh and jack waf is far from being dead nothing ever dies in infosec it just comes back as something um new if youve never trusted me before and why should you waf it wont be called that once its bundled with database activity monitoring is going to be back in a big way
839727 one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
839728 as newshour viewers know we strive mightily to make sure each side gets roughly equal time in conducting debates like this the attempt was not successful in this case though not for lack of trying a look at the
839729 i wont comment on the quality of boots answers as many viewers did
839730 most police divisions struggle to put two cars on the road each shift and those crews can have up to 30 jobs backed up on their call sign when they start duty
839731 i would love to be on the road for any entire shift to catch crooks
839732 her only answer to every issue is to pretend its not happening
839733 we need more police presence where young people are active
839734 these youth gangs should be home in bed police have got to have the power to get them home where they belong
839735 they have the statistics but they dont want them released because they are embarrassing
839736 im concerned by advice from the police commissioner that what were starting to see in relation to youth violence is firstly younger teenagers involved secondly more girls involved in this sort of activity and thirdly a higher likelihood that some sort of weapon particularly knives being involved
839737 these are difficult issues for our police they involve responsibility from our schools from parents and from the community and a law enforcement response
839738 this is a two step process in giving professional pay for teachers
839739 first we need to ensure as a country that we have a competitive professional salary to attract teachers in the numbers required to ensure a qualified teacher in front of every single classroom no matter where it is in the country
839740 beyond that i restate our preparedness to negotiate a framework that further recognises and rewards demonstrated teaching skills knowledge and practice
839741 i like the idea of having a set of standards that are a way of recognising things when still in the classroom
839742 anything that gives you a roadmap for your professional development is definitely going to be helpful
839743 better ways to reward quality teaching certainly need to be developed and any reward system needs to be based on transparent standards for assessing teachers
839744 we need to find ways of valuing teachers who are teachers of excellence because we want to keep the best teachers in front of classrooms
839745 these really dangerous fats are in everyday foods that people eat and particularly in junk and processed foods
839746 trans fats offer no nutritional value whatsoever and indeed are linked to serious health issues
839747 we believe the time to act on trans fats is now
839748 the use of 457 visas to employ temporary skilled migrant workers has grown rapidly in recent years a total of 39 500 subclass 457 visas was granted in 2003 04 compared with an expected 100 000 places in each of 2007 08 and 2008 09
839749 it is irresponsible for any national government of australia to stand idly by while our major cities are threatened by the insecurity of water supply
839750 mr howard lacked the decency to even mention work choices at all during his 4400 word policy speech on monday work choices has become the industrial relations law that now dare not speak its name
839751 today i want to announce that mandatory detention is an essential component of strong border control but children and where possible their families will not be detained in an immigration detention centre detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable detention in immigration detention centres is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time
839752 in the future the immigration system will be characterised by strong border security firm deterrence of unauthorised arrivals effective and robust immigration processes and respect for the rule of law and the humanity of those seeking migration outcomes
839753 is indisputably adorable but it lacks the magic of the magliozzis unplugged
839754 this is not our show and besides it is an opinion program
839755 television talk show host wasnt using a racist expression oreo to describe barack obama during the episode that aired this past weekend but was merely summing up what he believed to be the view of jackson
839756 the transcript shows that mclaughlin was not expressing his own point of view but jacksons view of obama its clear from both text and context that john mclaughlin is speculating why jesse jackson said what he said about barack obama its jacksons view of obama not mclaughlins she said
839757 does it frost jackson jesse jackson that someone like obama who fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside that an oreo should be the beneficiary of the long civil rights struggle which jesse jackson spent his lifetime fighting for
839758 who fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside
839759 we take great care in crafting our segments often pre interviewing many people before selecting the ones you see on the air we talked with many bank analysts about last nights discussion the vast majority took the position you heard on the air that indymac bank failure in california is an aberration and that most banks are not in big trouble having said that there are skeptics out there and i take your point that we could have presented that view better please know that we will do many more discussions on the current economic situation including one tonight and one in the works for tomorrow i hope we are able to address your concerns in those finally we do not ever choose guests or segments based on our sponsors that would contradict everything we stand for
839760 the great american wealth machine that has been cranking out jackpots for the people at the top and pushing working people further down the ladder
839761 make arguments that would be convincing to someone who doesnt agree with you or else youre just cheerleading
839762 to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature
839763 hey kids hurry up all aboard the wild blimp ride get in line and wait your turn
839764 we watched the memorial day concert from wash dc excellent until the last song which was beautiful but someone needs to tell the performer that when you are singing god bless america he should remove his hat out of respect and maybe in honor of the occasion he couldve dressed up instead of looking like he just got done working on his car i realize the look is more causal now but for something like this concert where we are honoring those who died for our freedoms it would be nice to at least try to look nice he doesnt need formal wear just maybe nice pants and shirt and the least of which is no hat
839765 the individual you refer to is country singer rodney atkins i must admit considering the context of the concert that i agree with your assessment his attire was inappropriate i do hope you were able to enjoy the concert despite the singers wardrobe i also hope
839766 its clear from our annual presentation of this concert and the many veterans stories we tell throughout the year that the public television community deeply appreciates the dedication and sacrifice of our armed forces
839767 i wish to object to pbss programme secrets of the dead the vrba wetzler report
839768 in comparison with such a horrendous accusation it may seem trivial to note that the pbs programme wrongly described kasztner as a freedom fighter head of the hungarian jewish underground and leader of the jewish council but this kind of imprecision is symptomatic of an approach that passes judgment without a scrupulous examination of the facts
839769 as the author of dealing with satan kasztners daring rescue mission jonathan cape london february 2008 and one of those rescued by kasztner i must declare an interest nevertheless the fact remains that the pbs film and the announcements on the internet blatantly misrepresent kasztner casting him as the villain where he may deserve praise or at least the benefit of the doubt the academic contributors were even handed enough to recognise kasztners good intentions the programme as a whole by categorically blaming him for the destruction of the majority of hungarian jewry breached pbss own editorial standards of fairness accuracy objectivity and balance
839770 as you are clearly aware kastner has been a controversial figure since the end of the war and remains so even in death
839771 as you say the historians do a very nice job explaining all sides of the issue and telling the story of what kastner was trying to do and we made sure to give them the time to do so and to select bites that explained the different views
839772 gilbert also states very clearly that kastners intentions were honorable bizarrely kastner saved about the same number of jews as oscar schindler saved
839773 although it may not satisfy you i would like you to know that we spent a great deal of time working on the most honest way to tell the kastner story and while there are certainly other approaches that could have been used we believe that the film is both accurate and objective
839774 general slant of the program made him kastner appear a deliberate nazi collaborator
839775 these court cases came right at the end of the film as part of the wrap up about what became of each of the major players we only very briefly mention them at all and follow the information about kastners assassination with a comment from renowned historian sir martin gilbert clearly stating that kastner had saved as many lives as schindler and was truly pushing nazi ss officer adolph eichmann to free many more in light of the purpose of this film which was to tell the story of vrba and wetzlers escape from auschwitz this felt far more appropriate and positive an ending to the kastner story than a list of court cases which came to be as much about internal israeli politics as they were about kastner entire films could be made about kastner and the post wwii politics in israel related to peoples activities during the holocaust but since our film was about a different topic we selected the information and details that were most relevant to our story

839777 nor indeed is there any proof of post presidential sexual indiscretions on clintons part
839778 now if something raises to the level of concern for an aide or advisor then it passes muster for publication i think you need a stronger standard than that
839779 what happened inside the bush white house and washingtons culture of deception
839780 scott is saying what a lot of people around town have known for a very long time the problem is theyve had no credible witness in the inner circle to step up and say you betcha and let me explain exactly why this is so different which is what mcclellan does in the book you know theyre going to plead insanity theyre going to say scott has lost his mind and hes not the scott i knew but the fact is is that mcclellan has essentially stepped up to establish or try to establish some basic rules of the game that frankly we used to use a bit more which is you dont go to war under false pretenses for instance
839781 i think on balance yes this is one of the first times i think that a member of the presidents inner circle one of the texans who came to washington with him was regarded as being very close to him has gone this far in denouncing what the administration did with respect to iraq and has come right out and said that they deceived the american people and that is news
839782 whether public statements regarding iraq by u s government officials were substantiated by intelligence information
839783 well i dont think hans blix and mohamed elbaradei were in the consensus but lets move on ive got to go have a great weekend fellows
839784 a couple other developments that are worth remarking even though they happened at the beginning of the week and it now seems like a long time ago al gore came out of the closet here and endorsed we dont know where hes been exactly
839785 come on he came out and he endorsed barack obama hes a big democrat he was the nominee of the party in 2000 what took him so long and does it make a difference
839786 a couple other developments that are worth remarking even though they happened at the beginning and it now seems like a long time ago al gore endorsed
839787 our program on june 20 was indeed taped before a live audience in atlanta and in fact gwen made an innocuous remark leading into a discussion of al gores endorsement of barack obama
839788 mr peyser contacted us a second time asking why there wasnt mention in the transcript of audience reaction to gwens comment and that of one panelist our associate producer thinking mr peyser might have been offended and in an attempt to be sensitive made the decision on her own to edit the transcript mr peyser took issue with that after a discussion with gwen the transcript was restored as originally posted gwen also contacted mr peyser to explain her position as gwen noted the transcript should not have been changed and rest assured we will see that it doesnt happen again
839789 public television is made possible by a remarkable public private partnership involving individuals businesses state and federal governments foundations and educational institutions
839790 federal statutes require that program funders be disclosed on the air at the time of a broadcast and pbs has developed strict guidelines to which national underwriters must adhere the pbs underwriting guidelines can be found online at
839791 our underwriting credits announcements consume a fraction of the time the networks dedicate to commercial television over a full hour pbs runs only about 5 minutes of underwriting announcements and promotion while the networks run as much as 17 minutes or more of non programming content beyond our guidelines for underwriting credits our non commercial mission is seen in our content which is chosen for its quality rather than its commercial appeal to advertisers

839801 inside the middle class bad times hit the good life
839802 fewer americans now than at any time in the past half century believe theyre moving forward in life americans feel stuck in their tracks a majority of survey respondents say that in the past five years they either havent moved forward in life 25 or have fallen backward 31
839803 the italics are mine to emphasize the strength of what pew was reporting
839804 when asked to measure their progress over a longer time frame americans are more upbeat nearly two thirds say they have a higher standard of living than their parents had when their parents were their age
839805 economic demographic technological and sociological changes since 1970 have moved some groups up the income ladder and pushed others down winners include seniors ages 65 and older blacks native born hispanics and married adults the income status of all of these groups improved from 1970 to 2006 losers include young adults ages 18 to 29 the never married foreign born hispanics and people with a high school diploma or less all of these groups have seen their relative income positions decline
839806 nonetheless these downbeat appraisals both of personal progress and of middle class well being in general are not the publics only perspectives on this matter
839807 all of these economics trends stagnation in the short term rising prosperity and rising inequality in the long term provide a context for the nuances of public opinion on the subject of the squeeze when survey respondents say they havent moved forward in recent years the economic data say theyre right when respondents say theyre doing better than their parents the economic data say theyre right when respondents say it has become more difficult to maintain a middle class standard of living the data once again say theyre right if what they mean is that it has become harder for people in the middle to keep pace with those above them
839808 ask americans how the economy is doing and their answer is stark it is not just bad it is run for the hills terrible
839809 but the reality is different according to most broad measures of how the economy is doing its not all that grim
839810 this paradox has created a unique challenge for those guiding the economy who worry that americans pessimistic views will become a self fulfilling prophecy

839836 shows that americans consider pbs the nations most trusted institution among nationally known organizations
839837 included in the program is dr amens prescription to prevent or delay the onset of alzheimers disease
839838 a major supplier of quality programming to public television stations across the nation
839839 its 10 on a saturday night and on my local pbs station a diminutive middle aged doctor with a toothy smile and televangelical delivery is facing a rapt studio audience
839840 before the neurologist in me can voice an objection the doctor daniel amen is being interviewed by on air station kqed host greg sherwood
839841 if so thats a shame one of the messages of amens pbs special and his book on alzheimers is that early detection of a d can lead to methods that both slow the progression of the disease and prevent it but this opinion isnt shared by the vast majority of the medical community despite decades of studies there are at present no definitive long term treatments for a d or its prevention as amen would have viewers and readers believe
839842 the same criticism surely applies to those pbs stations that aired change your brain change your life without internal review or audience notification that no program review had been performed at the least the stations should simultaneously display a disclaimer indicating that the programs contents havent been specifically vetted by pbs without such a disclaimer anyone watching a pbs aired program must assume a caveat emptor default position
839843 preventing alzheimers was only 10 minutes of the 60 minute show
839844 the science behind preventing alzheimers disease is described in detail in preventing alzheimers which was published by putnam in 2004 and co authored by neurologist william r shankle dr shankle is one of the recognized worlds experts on alzheimers disease who developed one of the commonly used screening tools for alzheimers disease preventing alzheimers contains an extensive reference list 86 citations
839845 pbs however makes no judgment as to the suitability for broadcast of programs distributed by parties other than pbs
839846 to avoid misleading the public producers also should adhere to the principles of transparency and honesty by providing appropriate labels disclaimers updates or other information so that the public plainly understands what it is seeing

839850 oh yes we have a lot of homos and lezzies on board we are not supposed to get involved with physical relationships but nobody is going to tell me how to run my life
839851 to the public these men are members of a familiar fraternity presented tens of thousands of times on television and radio as military analysts whose long service has equipped them to give authoritative and unfettered judgments about the most pressing issues of the post sept 11 world
839852 hidden behind that appearance of objectivity though is a pentagon information apparatus that has used those analysts in a campaign to generate favorable news coverage of the administrations wartime performance the effort which began with the buildup to the iraq war and continues to this day has sought to exploit ideological and military allegiances and also a powerful financial dynamic most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air those business relationships are hardly ever disclosed to the viewers and sometimes not even to the networks themselves but collectively
839853 represent more than 150 military contractors either as lobbyists senior executives board members or consultants
839854 analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters records show they have been taken on tours of iraq and given access to classified intelligence they have been briefed by officials from the white house state department and justice department in turn members of this group have echoed administration talking points sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access a few expressed regret for participating in what they regarded as an effort to dupe the american public with propaganda dressed as independent military analysis
839855 many analysts strongly denied that they had either been co opted or had allowed outside business interests to affect their on air comments and some have used their platforms to criticize the conduct of the war
839856 many analysts said network officials were only dimly aware of these interactions the networks they said have little grasp of how often they meet with senior officials or what is discussed some networks publish biographies on their web sites that describe their analysts military backgrounds and in some cases give at least limited information about their business ties but many analysts also said the networks asked few questions about their outside business interests the nature of their work or the potential for that work to create conflicts of interest analysts said their network handlers also raised no objections when the defense department began paying their commercial airfare for pentagon sponsored trips to iraq a clear ethical violation for most news organizations
839857 some e mail messages between the pentagon and the analysts reveal an implicit trade of privileged access for favorable coverage robert h scales jr a retired army general and analyst for fox news and national public radio whose consulting company advises several military firms on weapons and tactics used in iraq wanted the pentagon to approve high level briefings for him inside iraq in 2006 recall the stuff i did after my last visit
839858 currently a consultant to the pentagon and receives regular briefings there
839859 he visited iraq this past october under the auspices of the pentagon
839860 we contacted six of the highest ranking republicans on the house armed services committee to talk about the dont ask dont tell policy all declined interviews the pentagon also declined when we asked for a spokesperson on gays in the military pentagon officials pointed us to retired army lt col robert maginnis
839861 is a senior strategist with the us army in the pentagon which is a contracted position with bcp international limited an alexandria va based company since october of 2002 col maginnis has been a member of the secretary of defenses retired military analysts group
839862 no defense industry ties and no fondness for the administration
839863 as far as we know during the first hot phase of the iraq war the newshour never put on as guests and certainly not in solo slots any of the retired military people mentioned in the new york times as far as we can determine none of our military analysts during the war came to our studios armed with talking points directly from secretary rumsfeld and torie clarke the former assistant secretary of defense for public affairs who oversaw the departments dealing with the retired officer analysts further we believe that any review of our programming during that time would show that colonels lang and gardiner supplemented by colonels warden anderson and davis all of whom were on monthly retainer provided the most astringent and astute analysis of the war seen on american television
839864 we are always working to make sure we are as transparent as possible in spelling out the current roles of our guests either financial or political

839867 sprout was created as a partnership among comcast corporation hit entertainment pbs and sesame workshop we do not receive any public funding and much like other networks we require the support of program sponsors and advertisers in order to provide quality programming advertising or sponsorships on sprout will never interrupt a program and we only feature messages targeted to the parent or caregiver not the child viewer we follow the guidelines established by the childrens industry and the childrens advertising review unit caru self regulatory guidelines for childrens advertising
839868 it really burns me up to have to endure the lowbrow idiocy and the indulgence in self pity and hatred and blaming of other people that make up blogs like the field negro given the tone and content of the blog he should have called it the field nigger shouldnt he the owner of the blog claims to be a lawyer in philadelphia if he is smart enough to be a lawyer he should be smart enough to be able to defend his opinions and allow everyone to comment but he has shut the public out and allows only his friends to comment i dont blame him since his content is so lowbrow if a white person has a comparable blog about the view points of white people then we are stereotyped as racist only blacks jews and other ethnic groups can get away with that that is the source of a lot of white resentment that our freedoms have been taken away and we are second class citizens in our own country the map in one of the field negros posts shows a divided america based upon ethnic and religious identity it is my argument that diversity leads to the breakup of countries and i have talked before about the breakup of america that will result from multi culturalism im glad to see that the field negro legitimizes my fears for americas future it occurs to me however that there is no way that blacks jews or other minorities are going to attempt to divide up america they are parasites who could not exist without white people to feed upon
839869 why is the field negros blog not considered racist and unpatriotic

839947 for me the actual race was one to forget really
839948 it happened completely without warning without giving the slightest indication i was managing the race because i had a good advantage over second place after hamilton was delayed with a problem and i was taking no risks whatsoever i am very frustrated at the moment
839949 the race started quite well as i had a good pace then it all went to hell at the first pit stop as the guys had to use the fire extinguisher and i got a lot of foam on my visor it happened again at the second stop and this time i had foam inside and outside my visor and couldnt see a thing
839950 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things that i dont like or the democrats have to accept some things that they dont like in exchange for actually moving us in the direction of actual energy independence then thats something im open to

839952 its like that old saying that you cant fight city hall
839953 want to link all of this to the serbian orthodox church and they want to say that all serbs everywhere are guilty of the actions of these violent men and that most of all the serbs are the only people who have ever done these terrible things to their neighbors
839954 they forget that men like karadzic and slobodan milosevic were enemies of the church and used violence against the orthodox too our bishops were jailed and beaten for opposing the regime behind this violence

839957 as we now have developed treatments that are easier to take in terms of number of pills number of doses in the day and potential adverse effects and we now know there seem to be additional benefits with starting earlier the pendulum is swinging back to starting treatment earlier
