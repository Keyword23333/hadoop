1010000 by making deliberate misrepresentations about the benefits that post spin off employees could expect at hospira
1010001 premised on the assumption that the several counts of plaintiffs complaint arise out of independent and unrelated events
1010002 that the termination alleged in count i coupled with the policies challenged in counts ii and iii constitute a scheme that abbott conceived and that the defendants jointly adopted with the specific intent of avoiding the payment of projected benefits
1010003 conspired to allocate markets and to fix raise maintain and or stabilize the price of packaged ice in the united states in violation of state and federal antitrust laws
1010004 moving and responding plaintiffs variously support centralization in the following districts the southern district of california the eastern district of michigan the district of minnesota the northern district of ohio or the northern district of texas responding defendants support centralization in the district of minnesota
1010005 will eliminate duplicative discovery prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings especially with respect to the issue of class certification and conserve the resources of the parties their counsel and the judiciary

1010008 the grand jury investigating the packaged ice industry is based in this district
1010009 left blank the specific date by which the notice of cancellation had to be sent
1010010 a legal right under federal law to cancel this transaction without cost within three 3 business days from whichever of the following events occurs last 1 the date of the transaction which is june 16 2006 or 2 the date you received your truth in lending disclosures or 3 the date you received this notice of your right to cancel
1010011 if you cancel by mail or telegram you must send notice no later than midnight of or midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three events listed above
1010012 the import of the first circuits palmer decision with regard to the purely technical omission in the document embodying the notice makes the ruling here compelling and inevitable
1010013 at the very least prima facie evidence of the adequacy of the disclosure
1010014 the court went so far as to recognize that there was both statutory and case law support for the proposition that adherence to a model form bars a tila non disclosure claim entirely
1010015 it left for another day the question of whether such adherence invariably brings a creditor within a safe harbor
1010016 the text of the disclosures themselves rather than on plaintiffs descriptions of their subjective understandings
1010017 clearly and conspicuously indicate d that the debtor can rescind within three 3 business days from whichever of three enumerated events occurs last
1010018 midnight of the third business day following the latest of the three events listed above
1010019 t mobile charges customers for the receipt of unsolicited text messages and does not adequately disclose the practice in its contract with customers
1010020 rel ies entirely on a unified course of fraudulent conduct to support a claim in which fraud is not a necessary element must nonetheless satisfy rule 9 b in pleading the claim as a whole
1010021 they were not contractually liable to pay certain fees for text messaging
1010022 prejudice to the opposing party length of the delay and reason for the delay in determining whether the claimants neglect was excusable and the delay was made in good faith

1010024 to provide employees with break periods and meal periods toward the middle of an employee s work period in order to break up that employees shift
1010025 need not be resolved as part of the certification process
1010026 the court erred in so finding because it could not determine whether individual or common issues predominate in this case and thus whether a class action was proper without first determining this threshold issue
1010027 had the court correctly decided the elements of plaintiffs rest meal break and off the clock claims it could have only concluded liability could only be established by making individual inquiry into each plaintiffs claims and they thus are not amenable to class treatment
1010028 we conclude that 1 while employers cannot impede discourage or dissuade employees from taking rest periods they need only provide not ensure rest periods are taken 2 employers need only authorize and permit rest periods every four hours or major fraction thereof and they need not where impracticable be in the middle of each work period 3 employers are not required to provide a meal period for every five consecutive hours worked 4 while employers cannot impede discourage or dissuade employees from taking meal periods they need only provide them and not ensure they are taken and 5 while employers cannot coerce require or compel employees to work off the clock they can only be held liable for employees working off the clock if they knew or should have known they were doing so
1010029 because the rest and meal breaks need only be made available and not ensured individual issues predominate and based upon the evidence presented to the trial court they are not amenable to class treatment

1010034 though the decision could be appealed its the first in the country to declare the fees illegal in a state and could affect other similar lawsuits with broad implications for the nations fast growing legions of cell phone users the judge who is overseeing several other suits against telecommunications companies that involve similar fees also told the company to stop trying to collect 54 7 million from other customers who havent yet paid the charges they were assessed the suit said about 2 million californians were assessed the fee

1010040 all of humanity is in the same boat earth and if that boat is threatened or starts to sink we need to have a lifeboat plain and simple to not plan is not a plan it is a recipe for disaster im proud to be a lifeboat 500 member since it provides a priceless service to all of humanity
1010041 how about a story arc in which sarah and john elicit the help of the lifeboat foundation in warding off the rise of the machines id like to see a heavily armed paramilitary cell within the foundation all decked out in camouflage and talking trash about tearing skynet a new memory cache and the like
1010042 human survival has always been in mortal danger it is only our slow perception of time that has given us the illusion of stability whether we call it luck or by design we have gotten to a point where through technology we may escape the risk horizon on earth now we have to believe this is possible and that we will do it because whatever stance we take collectively will be self fulfilling

1010045 today it is outrageous that the term existential risk is not even in the vocabulary of most policymakers not to mention the public at large the next decade is absolutely critical either we get these issues recognized globally from the highest levels of intergovernmental meetings down to the lowest common denominator of popular culture or we abandon all hope of steering our future as it overcomes us
1010046 a self replicating pathogen whether biological or nanotechnology based could destroy our civilization in a matter of days or weeks we cannot rely on trial and error approaches to deal with existential risks and that is why i support the lifeboat foundation

1010176 but thanks to the will of the tribes security forces army and all iraqis we defeated them
1010177 the current trend is to reach an agreement on a memorandum of understanding either for the departure of the us forces or a memorandum of understanding to put a timetable on their withdrawal
1010178 in all cases the basis for any agreement will be respect for the full sovereignty of iraq
1010179 we cant have a memorandum of understanding with foreign forces unless it has dates and clear horizons determining the departure of foreign forces were unambiguously talking about their departure
1010180 we dont have a specific date in mind but we need to agree on the principle of setting a deadline

1010190 very clearly the insurgency is in no position to overthrow the government or really even to challenge it
1010191 its actually almost in no position to try to confront it by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
1010192 we do think that there is some assessment ongoing as to the continued viability of fight in iraq
1010193 theyre not going to abandon iraq theyre not going to write it off none of that but what they certainly may do is start to provide some of those resources that would have come to iraq to pakistan possibly afghanistan

1010198 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life

1010296 weve just started a large soa initiative and that was undertaken from the top down
1010297 business right up to board level saw the need for us to improve our processes our it processes our business processes
1010298 we needed to do something about services and process management so it was a management buy in that that enabled us to go down the business process and services road
1010299 there were a number of things in it that we worked on
1010300 one of the things we felt we could drive into the business was soa we did a lot of research looking around the industry at what the big players were doing
1010301 we got some advice from different places and formulated our corporate it strategy
1010302 that strategy then went up to the board through our chief executive
1010303 we had it people going up and educating them on what the industry was doing and getting the buy in from the board
1010304 they really came on board and said they could see the value and the benefits
1010305 but how was it going to reduce costs in the business and get initiatives to market faster
1010306 those were the big selling points for soa building it up from parts into a bigger solution
1010307 in the middle layer some of the business leaders from the different departments have taken a leading role in coming on board and understanding what it can do with processes

1010319 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
1010320 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit

1010351 the architects of this network of secret prisons and secret torture were a small but powerful group within the bush administration dick cheney stood at the center of the effort but delegated many of its operations to others the vice presidents counsel and later chief of staff david addington was a ruthless bullying enforcer of the strategy effectively derailing all challenges by claiming that everything had been mandated by the president and by dismissing all legal and moral challenges as na ve and weak john yoo a law professor from the university of california berkeley who worked in the justice departments office of legal counsel drafted an infamous memo giving legal cover to torture by simply redefining what torture was virtually anything short of deliberate killing george tenet the eager to please c i a director william haynes the militant general counsel to the pentagon alberto gonzales the weak and pliable white house counsel who later became attorney general all played vital roles in the creation and protection of these covert strategies
1010352 there is no happy ending to this sordid and shameful story despite growing political pressure despite supreme court decisions challenging the detainment policy despite increasing revelations of the once hidden program that have shocked the conscience of the world there is little evidence that the secret camps and the torture programs have been abandoned or even much diminished new heads of the defense and justice departments have resisted addressing the torture issue aware that dozens of their colleagues would face legal jeopardy should they do so and the presidential candidates of both parties have so far shown little interest in confronting the use of torture or recommitting the country to the geneva conventions and to americas own laws and traditions
1010353 the bush administration is not of course the first or only regime to violate civil liberties franklin roosevelt all authorized or tolerated terrible violations of civil and human rights all of them in response to great national and global crises in some respects the bush administration is simply following a familiar path by responding to real dangers with illegal and deplorable methods

1010357 the way we did backup before was entirely user based and we had to trust them to do it
1010358 the biggest problem is we work around the clock every day and my backup window became non existent because the guys would always have the files open
1010359 tapes were too slow unreliable and expensive and the backup window for what we did was too big
1010360 if we dont have the data at the end of a flight we may as well not have gone up
1010361 if they blow up the laptop stand on the usb stick or drop it all out of the aeroplane i have a copy of it as well so we can recover that data
1010362 usually before the plane lands the navigator puts the usb into the laptop and it back up to the usb stick
1010363 once they get back into the office they can plug their laptop into the network put in the usb stick again and it will make another copy of that data across the wire into a database that i have access to
1010364 i can recover data remotely on any site without talking to anybody in seconds instead of hours and it gives us peace of mind that we wont lose our data
1010365 wollongong for instance has about 28 minutes of backup a night and that is a full backup of all changes on all files across 20tb
1010366 it will probably roll out to some managers who spend a bit more time remotely from the office
1010367 that would mean if my building burns down i can recover it all from one of the other sites and vice versa
1010368 this is the first new architecture developed for computer graphics in the past 10 years

1010382 those responsible for this crime deserve the most serious penalty but this should fall short of the death penalty
1010383 the commission has campaigned for the universal abolition of the death penalty around the world over the course of this year and we must take this action as a matter of principle
1010384 capital punishment should not be used as revenge or retribution or as a deterrent
1010385 we must be consistent in our defence of human life even in the case of people who are responsible for the most appalling actions

1010413 the length of the fifty row halls stretches between him and aless but still her heart shudders as if he her chum her buddy were breathing into her hair this collapsing of distance is just one of the things she hates about being in love with patrick
1010414 patrick has been giving voice to his grief talking about his emotions in the direct manner the wife encouraged aless doesnt care for it his old moody detachment put a little space between them space that she spent her time trying to violate now when patrick says these things he feels too close intimate in every wrong way she has to resist the impulse either to draw him to her or shove him back

1010448 about the poem frost asserted you have to be careful of that one its a tricky poem very tricky and he is of course correct the poem has been and continues to be used as an inspirational poem one that to the undiscerning eye seems to be encouraging self reliance not following where others have led but a close reading of the poem proves otherwise it does not moralize about choice it simply says that choice is inevitable but you never know what your choice will mean until you have lived it

1010500 it is a sad day when two superb olympic athletes whose performances earned a total of 14 gold medals combined prostitute themselves for undisclosed amounts of money to help allergan sell botox
1010501 about five years ago i realized that while i exercised and ate right most of my life there was nothing i could do on my own that would get rid of those two stubborn frown lines stamped on my forehead they looked like an 11 and made me upset with the way i looked and thats when i decided to talk to my physician about botox r cosmetic treatment i attained a perfect 10 at age 14 and im working hard to stay close to that in all that i do
1010502 as a financial advisor and motivational speaker my facial expression is a very important part of my message when i am serious my 11 makes me look angry and unapproachable rather than congenial i knew i had to do something about it but for a long time i just didnt know what my options were then i heard about botox

1010566 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1010567 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1010568 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
1010569 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
1010570 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1010571 in the emerging markets where hsbc is the leading international bank growth remained strong in the period as real asset prices continued to rise and infrastructure development continued to boost economic growth which supported consumer confidence and spending

1010573 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1010574 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding

1010576 we are going to be in this for the long haul
1010577 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1010578 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
1010579 we must categorically reject any attempt to so called normalise aids or treat this epidemic as just one of many medical problems
1010580 now more than ever do we need an exceptional response

1010598 badly affected and it appears that at least one of them would have his hand and leg chopped off this is what our high altitude doctors believe
1010599 if north american churches do not accept the need for moratoria on same sex blessings and the consecration of gay clergy we are no further forward we continue to be in grave peril
1010600 the government has not abandoned the plan for additional track on the dandenong line

1010602 given the complexity of the dandenong corridor rail project it has been broken into smaller stages to minimise disruption on the rail network and introduce benefits progressively

1010623 i just found it amazing that they didnt take fingerprints or do any testing at all
1010624 i just felt that what they did was just identify the men they looked at their wallets and saw how much money they had
1010625 the advice was the vessel having been exposed to the sea elements for five days does extremely limit the possibility of the recovering of fingerprints
1010626 that plus the lack of obvious signs of struggle or violence on board led to the decision

1010751 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1010752 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation

1010762 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
1010763 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

1010788 thank you so much for an unforgettable experience we loved the show the dinosaurs were incredibly life like i was amazed at how much they moved and how animated they were my children were entranced what i also found impressive was the lighting design the set design and the sound first class production elements greatly enhanced the spectacle the cast is excellent and the crew superb we learned a lot and had fun doing it this is a show that you can take anyone to from toddlers to seniors i will tell all my friends about this fabulous production thank you once again for giving my young paleontologists a thrill that they will never forget
1010789 the show was absolutely wonderful my kids loved it as an adult i loved that they included some humor into the narration and dinosaurs our seats were amazing they had the first 3 5 rows blocked off im assuming to accommodate the dinosaurs tails and such and we had seats in row 8 on the lower level again thank you for offering such a great contest
1010790 i could not wait to tell my son amadou that he and i as well as his two cousins ages 6 and 10 would be able to attend
1010791 the dinos were amazing with head body movements and very authentic looking their roars were so loud you could feel the rumble the show was dark and loud and in my mind geared towards the ages of 8 and up the little ones were scared to death while those over the age of 8 were fascinated all in all the show was superb thanks again for giving my family the chance to experience walking with dinosaurs it is one we wont forget
1010792 i do want to let you know that i took my husband and our 21 yr old son and our 9 1 2 yr old daughter whos autistic

1010797 the bbc series was a brilliant blend of special effects escapism excitement and information
1010798 this is a show that could only fit in arenas as the creatures are so absolutely immense in size audiences seated in the lower seats are all but overwhelmed by the dinosaurs while those seated in higher seats can view the entire spectacle and panorama of the production it is the closest youll ever get to experiencing what it was like when they walked and ruled the earth
1010799 the dinosaurs are stunning life size and faultlessly nimble in act one the beasts parade into the arena gnashing and cavorting as a safari suited paleontologist describes their attributes in the second half the action cranks up culminating in a spectacular clash as a t rex mom defends her baby from predators sonny tilders triumphant creature design ensures walking with dinosaurs is a truly spectacular spectacular it is everything a dino phile could want

1010813 oui jai trouv un paquet de cigarettes tu ne fumes plus depuis 10ans je pensais que cetait un vieux je lai jet
1010814 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1010815 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1010816 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1010817 they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honour
1010818 it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me
1010819 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that
1010820 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1010821 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future
1010822 dina is still working on the date of the party but its looking like towards the end of the year
1010823 lindsays new album spirit in the dark is out in november so i wouldnt be surprised if its around then
1010824 theyve been keeping the relationship quiet for months and trying to pass each other off as just good friends
1010825 but theyve decided it isnt a fling its for life so they want to make their romance public
1010826 time will tell i hope it wont its a way ive been successful with so far in my career and something i want to try and keep at a real high level
1010827 the way i play is very gut instinct orientated and i like to do things spontaneously i like to do what i feel is right in a situation
1010828 i think over the years ive played cricket ive gained a good cricket brain my gut instinct when ive been batting for england has assisted me tremendously its a brand new challenge for me and i love challenges
1010829 huge boots to try and fill michael was a great leader and a great friend
1010830 you could see how emotional michael was when he spoke about his family and its an emotional decision
1010831 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room and a lot of opinionated people i sat down with peter and we had a real good discussion about how we want to take this team forward i think my position from a player to a captain is totally different and we need to unite and to get on the same hymn sheet
1010832 i will always respect what happened in the past and i will always ask for advice im fresh into this and i will need some help one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from senior members in the squad who have said they are right behind me
1010833 i havent even thought that far ahead my concern this week is about how we can salvage pride from this series
1010834 hopefully i am going to bat exactly the same way the way colly paul collingwood and i played is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and against australia you have to be positive and aggressive
1010835 we have a crisis that is potentially looming so please keep your water use in check
1010836 we want to do all we can to convey to the public to step up so we can avoid mandatory restrictions next year
1010837 it represents a five to tenfold increase in our costs of implementing this condition it could drive up the cost to the point where it could make it difficult for us to finance the project
1010838 it doesnt appear to us that youre necessarily going to result in reduced water imports and thereby reduce emissions

1010914 i am surprised why there are questions around dulha mil gaya being two years in the making with due respect to jaane tu ya jaane naa even it took as much as 3 5 years to reach the finishing line
1010915 success of jaane tu ya jaane naa shows what stuff good films are made of also it tells that if at all there is some delay in a films shooting being completed it could well be for the products betterment itself we are also not hurrying up on dulha mil gaya
1010916 i didnt compromise even when i made raju ban gaya gentleman with shah rukh khan that was such a long time ago and at during those days so many people didnt want me to make a film with a rank newcomer like shah rukh still i believed my instincts same is the case with dulha mil gaya i know it is a very good film in the making and director muddassar aziz is doing such a brilliant job why should there be any compromise just in order to release the film faster
1010917 has shah rukh khan ever said anything to this tune so why anyone should be speculating on this he was sent a bound script just like it was sent to sushmita sen or fardeen khan everyone knew what their role and believed in the project there are loose talks around lack of dates from shah rukh but in actuality that was never the case
1010918 fortunately or unfortunately i havent hired any pr office to plug stories on my behalf neither do i have anyone enrolled to deny any hogwash that has been written about dulha mil gaya i have allowed press to do their job while i have carried on with mine
1010919 contrary to the belief of many that the film has been stalled let me clarify that it is pretty much going on at a good pace we are in the closing stages of a 20 day marathon shoot at panchgani vashi and pune with this we would have shot 90 of the film only a few scenes and a song with shah rukh khan remain which would be canned within next 3 months hence bringing the principal shoot to closure meanwhile editing on the film is already on and there is very good probability of us arriving in january 2009

1010929 digitisation offers a new frontier for the broadcasters and viewers in terms of both programming quality and quantity the launch of new interactive services alongside with the free to air high definition and multi channel television broadcasting services already commenced since last december will no doubt bring about a brand new audio visual experience to our viewing public in hong kong
1010930 after the successful launch of digital terrestrial television dtt in hong kong at the end of 2007 the next important step is to deploy interactive tv services to boost the dtt penetration
1010931 in addition to providing television services digital television platform allows many new services that are unique and not available on traditional analogue television to be easily accessible to viewers tvb is proud to be the first to introduce interactive data television services and 5 1 dolby surround sound on free tv in hong kong these value added services will definitely be a driving force for dtt adoption
1010932 today the hong kong dtt middleware standard the hong kong profile is ready the conformance testing is ready the industry consortium for improving the hong kong profile is being set up the live broadcast of real applications has commenced a labeling scheme has been set up and set top boxes idtvs that can work with these applications are available in the market
1010933 in order to facilitate the development of interactive tv services it is essential that every industry player is working to a common middleware standard
1010934 we are pleased to announce the set up of the mheg 5 hong kong profile testing platform at our wireless communications test laboratory wctl the first of its kind in the region the powerful test and measurement hardware can validate major test criteria encompassing iso specifications mheg 5 profile conformance and the hong kong extension application lifecycle test and the object carousel to ensure top quality receivers for consumers and following the various test criteria wctl can execute more than 400 test cases for set top box manufacturers and developers
1010935 both astri and tvb endorsed hkstp as its conformance testing partner for the interactive tv services because of the neutral role that hkstp can play and its stringent testing procedures in accordance with advanced international standards for these reasons tvb also requires all dtt receivers that wish to obtain the tvb interactive tv logo to first pass hkstps conformance test

1010942 were using measurements within the vendors labs that we evaluate
1010943 we use this to create a methodology to validate that these technologies are energy efficient relative to a baseline
1010944 basically what we have to demonstrate to the utility is that the technologies being offered by these vendors are more efficient than the average storage technology
1010945 we noticed that not enough customers were taking advantage of these rebates in large part because not enough technologies were qualified
1010946 we launched conserve it as a way to accelerate the qualification of vendor technologies within these types of rebate programs
1010947 we have begun to have discussions in earnest outside of pg amp es territory in other parts of california in texas on the east coast and even outside of the u s in canada

1010950 the current strategies for taming the volcano of emissions from the developing world are not working
1010951 ideally the financial incentives provided by carbon offsets along with other financial and diplomatic tools would encourage changes in behaviour now that will ultimately make the transition to binding emissions limits easier for these understandably reluctant nations
1010952 our analysis of cdm energy sector projects indicates that just the opposite may in fact be happening
1010953 the cdm encourages countries to avoid binding limits on emissions and to concentrate emission reduction activities on marginal investments for which it is easiest to assert that the investment is additional
1010954 hfc 23 emitters can earn almost twice as much from the cdm credits as they can from selling refrigerant gases by any measure a major distortion of the market
1010955 its akin to getting on a plane to china to buy an ounce of gold for 100 and then going back to london and selling it for 300

1010968 este putin probabil sa primesc aproximativ 100 de voturi din parte publicului in conditiile in care nu eram o debutanta si in conditiile in care am primit cea de a doua nota ca valoare din partea juriului mai exact 6 puncte sunt de parere ca am fost sabotati in ceea ce priveste televotingul
1010969 nu mi se pare normal ca sa se califice in finala cineva care a obtinut nota 2 din parte juriului nu este specificat nicaieri in regulament ca acel concurent care obtine cele mai multe voturi din partea publicului se califica in finala
1010970 primii doi clasati la fiecare dintre cele trei semifinale vor concura in finala din data de 10 august intr o emisiune transmisa in direct pe postul tvr1 primii trei clasati in finala din 10 august vor concura la brasov in cadrul concursului international
1010971 nu vrem sa suparam pe nimeni nu avem nimic personal cu nici unul din artisti dar regulamentul este regulament iar acesta nu s a respectat de pilda in regulament scrie ca acest concurs trebuia sa se desfasoare in formula voce si negativ pentru solisti si grupuri vocale toata partea vocala va fi live si in formula full live vocal si instrumental pentru grupuri vocal instrumental cu toate acestea a fost o trupa instrumentala care a facut playback instrumental in regulament la inscriere mai scrie ca nu pot participa la concurs artistii care au reprezentat romania la la una din editiile anterioare nici in acest sens regulamentul nu a fost respectat chiar daca au fost modificate ulterior clauzele regulamentului care specificau acest lucru si nu intra in concordanta cu regulamentul initial la momentul depunerii dosarelor si selectarii celor 21 de concurenti romani cat despre televoting am primit telefoane de la multi prieteni care mi au spus ca nu au primit mesaj de confirmare cum ca votul s ar fi inregistrat sau au primit mesaj de confirmare cum ca votul a fost invalid pentru ca au mai votat odata dar nu primisera un mesaj de confirmare ca acel vot s a contorizat
1010972 sunt foarte multumit de votul primit de jasmine din partea juriului in privinta televotingului am dubii si nu cred ca acesta a fost unul real e putin suspect ca cineva care ia nota 6 de la juriu sa aiba 65 de voturi in conditiile in care a cantat impecabil a avut show a participat la festivalul mamaia si selectia nationala eurovision in doua editii nefiind un artist care sa treaca neobservat am facut o contestatie cerand detaliera apelurilor telefonice pentru ca a existat un interval mare in care jasmine nu a primit nici un vot
1010973 nu mi se pare corect fata de mine fiind concurent direct cu ea in prima semifinala sa fie calificata devreme ce nu a obtinut punctajul necesar regulamentul trebuie sa fie egal pentru toata lumea

1011026 it doesnt matter if sen obama presents these things or not why because it will never be enough even if he were to do all these things the pumas and their right wing allies would just find something else more and more and more unreasonable to demand
1011027 a his legal name and age b his legal parentage and place of birth c his legal sole nationality citizenship d whether or not he has ever been a citizen of any country other than the usa e whether or not he has ever registered for selective service f whether or not he has any outstanding tax debts and his current tax status g whether or not he has any outstanding criminal convictions etc even unpaid parking tickets may count h whether or not he is suffering from any mental illness or condition that might render him unfit for office including any record of drug or alcohol abuse i anything else any court election commission or secretary of state asks him to prove
1011028 no previous candidate so far as i am aware has ever had to prove all of these things but they can be asked to and obama almost certainly will be one may reasonably assume he will be asked for proofs in at least two states if he becomes the nominee he will also be cross examined about his friends and associates several of these questions could result in criminal charges should the answers be less than adequate in the opinions of the court the various secretaries of state or state electoral commissions boards if any of these questions produce negative results he will be removed from the ballot in that state
1011029 unless and until he proves all reasonable doubts baseless senator obama should remove his name from contention if he does not do so he risks promoting severe problems for the whole country as well as for himself

1011387 after completing the 2007 music city half marathon with no practice or preparation in 03 16 i resolved i would dedicate the following year to getting my body in better shape
1011388 during this year long training time i have experienced a reduction in weight 41 pounds a huge reduction in body fat and significant improvement in flexibility and strength as well as an improved mental approach to all aspects of my life
1011389 i completed the 2008 music city half marathon in 02 14 a reduction of 01 12 or 36
1011390 yesterday was awesome it was fun to spend the day with my co workers encouraging each other and getting to know some of them a little better and the thrill of crossing the finish line and the feeling of accomplishment there is nothing like it once i get over the aches and pains im ready to go again
1011391 i am so thankful for the challenge to participate in the half marathon
1011392 this was by far one of the best experiences i have had over the course of my life and while my goal was just to finish one i am now inspired and ready to train for future races
1011393 when i started training for the half marathon it was early january and we were so focused on the last quarter of the fiscal year that i thought of my goals for the race in terms of budget and target
1011394 there were many things that surprised me about my participation in the half marathon
1011395 i have never done anything like this before and i did better than i expected in the half marathon my neighbor jan eppard started walking with me as i was training she eventually decided to walk the race with me which really encouraged me
1011396 after finishing my first marathon last year i was so excited i lost weight and was feeling great when mike made his challenge this year i thought
1011397 im quite impressed with what god allowed to happen there was a lot against me and many things that could have taken a turn for the worse i simply took the race one focused step at a time and came out a winner on the other side it was a good experience for me
1011398 i just like to say i thank thomas nelson for extending such a wonderful opportunity to me and my fellow co workers
1011399 i starting running three times a week in january and did it consistently leading up to the race i did have a few setbacks as the weeks rolled on knee arch blister issues but i persisted my goal was to finish in 02 30 i finished in 02 15 53
1011400 i enjoyed my experience saturday but my last two miles where rough i was in so much pain as im sure everyone else was during the last two miles i told myself several times that i would never do this again but by the next day i was making plans goals for next year
1011401 my immediate goal is to keep running three times a week and periodically enter 5k 10k races next winter ill start my longer runs to get ready for cmm 09
1011402 i must say i was very apprehensive about signing up for the half marathon but glad i did i was already running three times a week for 30 minutes each time due to heart problems and cholesterol in both sides of my family however i thought 3 to 3 1 2 miles is quite different than 13 1 miles
1011403 ive always thought of myself as athletic and pretty physically fit so i finally gave in and decided to take the challenge that mike set before us my plan was to run the first three miles and then walk 2 minutes jog 8 and continue the 2 and 8 format until i finished and this is how i trained
1011404 i was not sure how long it would take me but i put down 2 hours and 45 minutes
1011405 anyhow after finally arriving i started in corral 21 and spent the first 5 or 6 miles zig zagging in and around people
1011406 i must say i had a great time and if asked right now whether or not i would sign up again for next years run id say yes during my training i never went more than 8 miles and quite honestly felt i could have kept on going once i crossed the line next year i plan to do the same thing and hopefully shave a few minutes off
1011407 i knew that i needed to get into better shape than i was in last fall
1011408 my wife karen and i ran the half marathon with the thomas nelson team this year
1011409 then one week before the race we both came up gimpy she had a knee injury that at times made it impossible for her to run even a few steps and i had tendinitis in my foot that was unlike anything id experienced in 24 years of running we were discouraged big time
1011410 the week before the race we took it easy and used lots of ice and ibuprofen
1011411 when we crossed the finish line we had achieved our original goal our official time was 1 58 and change
1011412 thank you all for checking on me i am okay but exhausted and very sore i can hardly walk but i will recover okay tomorrow i think
1011413 i finished although i would not say well i dont know my official time but by my watch it took me 04 18 i had to stop 10 times for the bathroom
1011414 i saw mike passed me in the other direction and he looked strong and well
1011415 run your own race my dad who is avid runner would advise this as i began my journey 13 weeks ago your race is yours and not anyone elses you can compare yourself with others along the route but it is your journey
1011416 many times i would try to keep up with my husband on the long runs and my body would scream slow down or you will not finish this properly or at even at all
1011417 looking at my life indeed i have gotten so much of my hearts desire but not at my time
1011418 as johnette lori and leslie were cheering us all on i though of the great encouragement we should feel everyday from god
1011419 i thought of this when i saw lori johnette and leslie therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles
1011420 the tennessean ran this article before the race april 26 in an article called
1011421 paulie i look forward to when you can walk beside me in a future country music marathon
1011422 the best part of the whole training racing experience i now have a group of 14 or so great individuals whom i consider close friends the relationships formed during the process will last far longer than the excitement of breaking the 2 hour barrier and for that i am grateful youll see me again next year
1011423 last year was the first time i participated in any type of event like this
1011424 i can truly say that my daughter is my best friend she is seventeen and she never ceases to amaze me in everything she sets out to do she has already done so much more at her age than i was able to and i dont see her slowing down any in her future
1011425 she strained her meniscus last year in training and now has a small tear
1011426 if you have not ever done a marathon or anything like it you should it is truly an experience you will never forget spiritually and physically
1011427 the half marathon makes me pause a moment to thank god for how very blessed we are to have health friends a good work environment and challenges that make us grow
1011428 i finished in 02 26 53 about six and a half minutes better than my 2007 time and now my goal for next year is 2 14 59 it was great competing with so many colleagues and i hope all of you do it again and for those who didnt run or walk commit your entrance fee early and start training
1011429 if youve seen the times you know that i barely finished under the four hour time limit mike laid down at the onset
1011430 i know that i would have long been over four hours had it not been for mandy and possibly not even finished had it not been for her im grateful to know we have an employee who has a heart that continues to see the worth of encouraging others even when sacrificial to her
1011431 mike i would like you to give my reimbursement to mandy for shes the one that truly deserves mine the thrill of crossing the finish is the close that inspires me to sign up for next year with 2 changes train better and recruit more to share the experience
1011432 i walked the half marathon on my 23rd birthday and finished in 03 12 01 happy birthday to me my present to myself was soreness
1011433 i never once thought i would even consider participating in a half marathon let alone actually do one
1011434 but when mike issued the challenge i made a hasty decision to participate and then couldnt back down because im cheap and wanted to get my money back for finishing
1011435 im so proud of myself and proud of everyone that i saw out there on saturday i never would have been able to do it without team nelson thanks for a great birthday
1011436 my wife melinda and i never seem to find or make the time to exercise on a regular basis when mike threw out the half marathon challenge i took it as the perfect opportunity to work toward a more definitive goal than the nebulous lets get into shape
1011437 it took some convincing to get melinda on board but the entry fee reimbursement and the gift card were great motivators
1011438 i wish training had gone better but we worked steadily and did fairly well our goal was to just finish in four hours as we trained we felt like we could finish in three and a half hours we got more and more excited and nervous as the big day drew near but our resolve to finish was strong
1011439 our final time came in at 03 23 seven minutes under our training pace and with the exception of some soreness and few blisters had a blast

1011743 wapo the off the books discounts werent the only problem
1011744 i dont think anyone expected that it would worsen as quickly as it has in fact if you go back and look at the surveys of economists and what they predicted in terms a recession you would see the number of economists who thought we would be in a recession in january was materially lower than the number of economists who think we will have a recession today so no one predicted the economy would worsen as quickly as it has the facts are however that in april john mccain also came out and said americans are hurting and thats why he proposed relief from gas taxes which would create instant relief in americas pockets that was way back in april so i think hes understood the economys an important issue for some time now
1011745 there is no job that is americas god given right anymore

1011755 were being clouded out by leadership issues rather than real issues and really at this time the labor government should frankly be on the nose
1011756 i find them quite incompetent and they sought of articulate a lot and do nothing and they even seem confused about what theyre doing
1011757 in the meantime were stuck in this leadership thing which is very sad
1011758 people generally expect politicians to stand up and have the courage and fight for what they want and take it

1011770 some terrorists inside and outside xinjiang have threatened to carry out sabotage activities targeting the olympic games
1011771 china has made full preparations against those activities and can ensure they will be nipped in the bud
1011772 the capabilities of the terrorists are limited and not as great as exaggerated by some media quite a number of them are a bunch of disorderly bands they are not capable of carrying out relatively large sabotage activities which are extremely few in xinjiang and they have all been defeated during their plotting stage
1011773 the principal threat to the olympics will not come from but from etim
1011774 those people who make a living out of short selling stocks are bordering on criminality
1011775 when we hear that weve got cracks in the bottom of our ore cars or even a ship has sunk at the berth we know those things are being put out to scare the mums and dads into selling their shares and of course the people whove shorted their shares then go and buy those shares
1011776 probably rightly so there is going to be questions asked about the culture in the afl the culture here at collingwood

1011778 right now the way im feeling is that if we played a game right now against st kilda and the st kilda boys roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id be over there to support him to tell you the truth
1011779 i know once i get to saturday night we are definitely all in it together
1011780 the collingwood football club is not only embarrassed by the situation we are absolutely furious
1011781 there is no excuse were sick and tired of this sort of behaviour from players mick malthouse gets belted week in week out as the coach and its time that these guys grew up and took responsibility for their actions
1011782 im pretty confident we can more than compensate for heath as a player this week but bugger him
1011783 were going to make sure he cops it theres going to be 60 000 people there hopefully and two million watching on tv the cameras will be on him
1011784 i went to shanghai and beijing in early 2001 with one of my best friends harry how who will also be covering the games for getty images a lot has changed since then 9 11 happened a few months after our return and clearly the world has changed quite a bit since then but mostly im looking to see how china has evolved since my first visit i have a lot of great memories from that trip harry and i first went to shanghai and harry hooked us up with an incredible deal at the ritz carlton 80 night with complimentary access to the executive level this meant that we could go to the executive level every afternoon and get unlimited refreshments at no additional charge four to five gin and tonics each is a great way to kick off an evening we had a blast most of our time was spent doing street photography 10 14 hours a day we both shot film i shot everything with a hasselblad x pan panoramic 35mm rangefinder camera a 45mm lens and 60 rolls of ilford xp2 b amp w film shooting black and white film with only one camera on lens and a small billingham bag man those were the days times sure have changed in the past 7 years i cant wait to see how things have evolved and i hope to get a least a brief chance to walk the streets again before i get sucked into the olympic bubble some of the initial posts will detail the gear im bringing why im leaving some stuff behind and how i packed it
1011785 the photographs of sergei mikhailovich prokudin gorskii 1863 1944 offer a vivid portrait of a lost world the russian empire on the eve of world war i and the coming revolution his subjects ranged from the medieval churches and monasteries of old russia to the railroads and factories of an emerging industrial power to the daily life and work of russias diverse population

1011792 i mean we are still probably the safest airline flying around
1011793 i am quite sure that things are talked about continual issues cause some reputational damage it is our job to make sure we get that reputation back
1011794 it was a bit unbelievable and seemed to take security five minutes to get out there he could have done anything to fuifui its pretty scary
1011795 we did have that lull we got ahead and then we slackened off a bit
1011796 theres plenty of enthusiasm in the side but we need mental toughness to grind out the win for the whole game
1011797 i dont think we were totally dominant i thought we lost our way a few times but we did enough to win and enough to show were getting better
1011798 im a bit cautious about that boost at making the eight theres absolutely no prize for being in the eight after 21 round
1011799 if we had the answer to that wed be much higher on the ladder
1011800 we came out with some errors that applied a lot of pressure to ourselves and were not able to hold teams out
1011801 but at no point on the field do any of the boys out there on the field give up obviously that last try was disappointing but theres guys out there busting their arse for the whole 80 minutes
1011802 it wasnt the ideal way to come back to your former club but in the end you dont get to write those scripts either

1011804 ascianos security price has been trading at a significant discount to fair value during 2008 for a number of reasons including market fears over debt levels downgrades to guidance its failed brambles stake and uncertainty as to how asciano will fund growth
1011805 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
1011806 quite simply asciano has the dominant market share of australias container trade is the dominant provider of container rail movements and dominant provider of coal and grain haulage in southeastern australia not to mention has a number of well positioned bulk port assets

1011818 and after hearing what she said to a christian magazine word came back from barbara that she wants to boot her off the show
1011819 barbara thinks sherri has become far worse of a problem than star jones and rosies odonnel when they were on the show and thats saying a lot
1011820 barbara may first give her a chance to shape up before shipping her out
1011821 and if barbara does let sherri go expect a fun farewell with the whole gang saying only nice things about sherri in public

1011891 we had a solid second quarter with stronger than expected results driven mainly by revenue growth at exhibitgroup giltspur the decline in income versus the 2007 second quarter was expected and was primarily driven by a change in the mix of shows at ges as well as becker groups expected operating loss we expect the becker group acquisition to be accretive to our full year results with operating losses in each of the first three quarters and a substantial profit in the fourth quarter
1011892 ges second quarter results came in at the higher end of our prior guidance reflecting positive base same show growth of 4 6 percent the expected decline in revenue from the 2007 second quarter was largely due to the loss of a major trade show which was mostly offset by new business and other revenue growth the expected decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenues and shifts in our mix of shows from higher margin to lower margin geographies additionally 2007 second quarter results included income of 3 9 million from a contract dispute settlement
1011893 results for the experiential marketing services segment were much stronger than our prior guidance driven mainly by increased client spending and new business at exhibitgroup giltspur we continue to be encouraged by the progress exhibitgroup giltspur is making to reposition the business for growth despite negative show rotation revenue of 13 million exhibitgroup giltspurs second quarter revenue increased by 3 6 million results for becker groups seasonally slow second quarter were slightly better than expected

1011978 tahaksin enn pandile elda et selline veidi arrogantne suhtumine oma t tajaskonda juhtkonna poolt v iks m danik olla ka laeval k siti mult kas tallinki juhtkond ei tule meiega kokku saama see siin ei ole ameti hingute m ng see on inimeste t sine n udmine neli aastat merekoolis ppinud mehed ei ole t na enam n us t tama taksojuhi v i l psja palgaga
1011979 tallink tegi ka selle vea et ei tulnud t na siia kohale ainus juhtkonnapoolne p rdumine mis t na hommikul tuli kirja n ol loeti baltic princessi pardal ette selles juhtkond lihtsalt v itis et streik on ebaseaduslik seal oli kirjas ka see et tallink oli meile kui ameti hingule teinud pakkumisi aga juttu polnud s nagi sellest et l puks p takse m istusp rane pakkumine teha
1011980 kinnitasin neile et streigi saab eesti vabariigis ebaseaduslikuks kuulutada vaid kohus teiseks et kella hest kaheni t suhe peatub ja ei ole mingeid t suhtest tulenevaid kohustusi allumist sisekorrale jne kinnitasin ka seda et ameti hingu liikmeid kes peaksid kannatama t andja ebaseaduslikest aktsioonide t ttu n iteks t tasust ilma j ma neid ameti hing aitab rahaliselt eeldatavasti garanteerime keskmise palga kolmeks kuuks
1011981 esimene asi mis k igil k sti teha oli streigilt tagasi tulles hakata seletuskirju kirjutama ma ei tea mida inimesed peavad kirjutama arvatavasti seda et nad osalesid seaduslikus streigis
1011982 nagu siin n ha on inimeste ksmeel tugev meil on ju p hiline puudus t na turul masinameestest
1011983 hoiatusstreigiga p ame anda m rku et nad on m istetamatult kaua venitanud l bir kimistega ja pole t itnud meie kui ameti hingu ja t tajate esindajate seaduslikke n udmist et t tasu t useks 1 septembrist 20 5 hoiatusstreigi eesm rk pole veel majandusliku kahju tekitamine kui l bir kimised ei too soovitud resultaati oleme me septembris sunnitud minema pikemaajalisele streigile
1011984 nach dem abgang von goran nikolic waren wir auf der suche nach einem athletischen power forward der auch von au en werfen kann ansu sesay bringt genau diese qualit ten mit sich
1011985 todos vivimos bajo el cielo pero algunos levantamos los ojos hacia las estrellas
1011986 our understanding with the us was good throughout and it never came to acrimony but they are the biggest subsidizers in the world in terms of what affects us so we will have to see them in court
1011987 seven bahai individuals have set up an illegal organization with connections to a number of countries including israel and they have received orders from them to undertake measures against the islamic system
1011988 this fact led to the arrest of seven individuals they have all confessed to the formation of an illegal organization including having ties with israel
1011989 gt israel arrests six jihadis conspiring to shoot down president bushs helicopter be respectful of others and their opinions
1011990 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
1011991 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
1011992 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
1011993 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts
1011994 something obama has done almost every day since he arrived in kenya last week
1011995 i think odinga has to look at critically where he is receiving his advice from just because somebody wants to run for president and he is using senator obama as his stooge as his puppet to be able to get where he wants to get
1011996 for their own separate reasons odinga and sheik abdullah abdi joined forces
1011997 sheik abdullah abdi agreed to swing islamic voters to odinga in kenya and odinga agreed to support islam should he become president
1011998 by endorsing raila odinga during his 2006 visit to kenya obama positioned himself to be seen by kenyans as an important u s senator who was joining forces with his luo tribal kinsman this positioning further sided obama with raila odinga as he ran against president mwai kibaki in the december 2007 presidential election in kenya
1011999 they just dont know about all the cool things we do here
1012000 there is no doubt the syrian regime in a bad and complicated condition
1012001 there is no doubt that the syrian regime is in a bad and complex situation there is no doubt that muhammed suleiman was one of the closest people to president bashar assad and his right hand in the armed forces
1012002 he knew everything and all issues were open to him including the security economic and armament issues
1012003 suleimans status exceeded his military rank and therefore he had no political aspirations his status was even more important than that of the defense minister
1012004 in the meantime however it is hard to determine the reasons behind the assassination we must wait three or four more days for things to become clear particularly when we are talking about an accurate assassination which was carried out by a sniper firing from the sea
1012005 the board remains confident of the outlook for the group particularly as a result of the recent increase in order pipeline to 140 000 meters and increased visibility of meter installations in the coming months
1012006 as a result completion of the upgrade is not now expected until the end of 2008 delays have also been experienced in accessing and developing the lower levels of the mine where higher grade particularly gold mineralisation is expected
1012007 accordingly contracts which the company expected to be signed in the first half of the year have not yet been signed
1012008 to advance the unity of working people to be a voice to be reckoned with by the obama administration which to me at this point looks like will be an overwhelming landslide victory over the republicans
1012009 you are disowning everything frank marshall davis wrote who cares about the use of the term mentor look in any dictionary you are quibbling about terms that mean the same no matter who uses them how come you havent taken issue with the editor of the books john edgar tidwell and the publishers university of wisconsin press and university press of mississippi i think you should contact the editor and publishers and have them either stand behind what has been written or disown it as you are fully aware if you have ever read either of the two books the only thing i have done is quote the books and say the same thing the editor has stated
1012010 if there is one thing frank marshall davis makes clear is that he had the utmost respect for communists because of the way communists fight for the rights of working people and against racism
1012011 todos vivimos bajo el cielo pero algunos levantamos los ojos hacia las estrellas
1012012 i just felt uncomfortable doing that because anthony had gotten so much criticism and a lot of it wasnt his fault

1012015 i was damned if i was going to let the fans dictate who was going to play quarterback
1012016 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
1012017 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1012018 thats because the republican party only sees americans as sources of revenue
1012019 cloudmark uses a completely different approach from traditional anti spam solutions
1012020 sibir and shell maintain a close working relationship sibir is considering all opportunities that would allow it to expand its business in russia

1012038 i am delighted sanjay will be joining motorola as co ceo and as ceo of mobile devices and i look forward to partnering with him
1012039 the abject silence on the part of the canadian arab federation in the face of vitriolic attacks on jews by muslim perpetrators is tantamount to tacit approval of anti semitism and gives a green light to others who would entertain the notion of attacking jews
1012040 cost pressures on manufacturers have been noticeable for over four years but in the last three months they have been their most intense for nearly three decades
1012041 little surprise that manufacturers are passing some of these higher costs onto customers although this is unlikely to rescue profits from a margin squeeze

1012078 all of us by virtue of our enculturation in western society in general and in american society in particular have deeply embedded within us certain ideas regarding what it means to be civilized and what it means to be primitive we have been taught that civilization represents an advanced state of human development with an extremely high level of achievement and sophistication in the arts and sciences technology government and social institutions to us even our religion has long since moved out of the morass of superstition and magic miracles
1012079 oh for a faith that is not resting on the wisdom of men but on the power of god and the demonstration of the spirit

1012152 you could be forgiven if you have the impression we have two presidents of late one elected the other acting as if the november election is a mere formality george w bush still holds the keys to the white house but barack obama is assuming the trappings of office to a degree never before seen in american politics and then there is john mccain for whom even the role of underdog appears to be a challenge

1012607 swimming is privileged to have such an accomplished sports administrator in kevin neil take over from glenn and the board is delighted to have kevin in the position as ceo
1012608 he is not only very well respected in the sporting and corporate world but he brings to the position a wealth of experience in not only managing a major sport but also the marketing and business nous required to take the sport forward in the future
1012609 we have a wonderful product from the grass roots of our community to the very elite of our sport who will represent australia in the coming days at the beijing olympic games
1012610 i know every member of the board is excited to have a person of kevins caliber at the helm as we enter what i believe to be one of the most exciting eras in our sport
1012611 we have some great initiatives at all levels which we believe will only enhance our community involvement
1012612 i personally am looking forward to working with kevin as is everyone who has come across his path in his already short time in the sport
1012613 he has taken a real interest in every aspect of swimming and i believe his instant interest as a board member created an impression that he was genuinely keen to do whatever he could to further the sport and thats a great trait
1012614 it was only six months ago that i came on to the board and here i am as the ceo its funny how things turn out but from the outset i was comfortable around the people i met and excited with the product
1012615 when glenn resigned to take up his position at nsw tennis i thought long and hard about taking the plunge into a sport i must admit i knew little about until this year but i have certainly liked what i have seen and i am excited about assisting in taking the sport into an exciting new era

1013175 perbuatan mana mana individu muslim sama ada pemimpin atau rakyat yang meletakkan kalungan bunga tabik hormat dan bertafakur yang dilakukan untuk tugu negara adalah bercanggah dengan prinsip prinsip akidah islam yang anti kepada sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1013176 perbuatan seperti itu seakan menjadikan tugu berkenaan berhala yang dihormati sekiranya pun pelakunya tidak mempunyai sebarang iktikad bahawa itu semua memberi manfaat dan mudarat maka perbuatan itu adalah sia sia dan bodoh ia tetap haram kerana meniru perbuatan musyrikin
1013177 jika pelaku beriktikad itu memberikan kemanfaatan kepada keamanan kedamaian ruh mereka yang telah meninggal dunia maka itu adalah perbuatan syirik yang jelas akidah islam menentang sebarang unsur keberhalaan
1013178 pemimpin atau sesiapa sahaja yang terlibat dalam perbuatan ini hendaklah bertaubat kepada allah dan kembali kepada akidah islam yang sebenar

1013184 the first banks were not founded for our system of deposit banking or for anything like it they were founded for much more pressing reasons and having been founded they or copies from them were applied to our modern uses the earliest banks of italy where the name began were finance companies the bank of st george at genoa and other banks founded in imitation of it were at first only companies to make loans to and float loans for the governments of the cities in which they were formed the want of money is an urgent want of governments at most periods and seldom more urgent than it was in the tumultuous italian republics of the middle ages after these banks had been long established they began to do what we call banking business but at first they never thought of it the great banks of the north of europe had their origin in a want still more curious the notion of its being a prime business of a bank to give good coin has passed out of mens memories but wherever it is felt there is no want of business more keen and urgent
1013185 the way in which the issue of notes by a banker prepares the way for the deposit of money with him is very plain when a private person begins to possess a great heap of bank notes it will soon strike him that he is trusting the banker very much and that in re turn he is getting nothing he runs the risk of loss and robbery just as if he were hoarding coin he would run no more risk by the failure of the bank if he made a deposit there and he would be free from the risk of keeping the cash no doubt it takes time before even this simple reasoning is understood by uneducated minds so strong is the wish of most people to see their money that they for some time continue to hoard bank notes for a long period a few do so but in the end common sense conquers the circulation of bank notes decreases and the deposit of money with the banker increases the credit of the banker having been efficiently advertised by the note and accepted by the public he lives on the credit so gained years after the note issue itself has ceased to be very important to him
1013186 and this explains why deposit banking is so rare such a note issue as has been described is possible only in a country exempt from invasion and free from revolution during an invasion note issuing banks must stop payment a run is nearly inevitable at such a time and in a revolution too in such great and close civil dangers a nation is always demoralised everyone looks to himself and everyone likes to possess himself of the precious metals these are sure to be valuable invasion or no invasion revolution or no revolution but the goodness of bank notes depends on the solvency of the banker and that solvency may be impaired if the invasion is not repelled or the revolution resisted
1013187 hardly any continental country has been till now exempt for long periods both from invasion and revolution in holland and germany two countries where note issue and deposit banking would seem as natural as in england and scotland there was never any security from foreign war a profound apprehension of external invasion penetrated their whole habits and men of business would have thought it insane not to contemplate a contingency so frequent in their history and perhaps witnessed by themselves france indeed before 1789 was an exception for many years under the old regime she was exempt from serious invasion or attempted revolution her government was fixed as was then thought and powerful it could resist any external enemy and the prestige on which it rested seemed too firm to fear any enemy from within but then it was not an honest government and it had shown its dishonesty in this particular matter of note issue the regent in laws time had given a monopoly of note issue to a bad bank and had paid off the debts of the nation in worthiess paper the government had created a machinery of ruin and had thriven on it among so apprehensive a race as the french the result was fatal for many years no attempt at note issue or deposit banking was possible in france so late as the foundation of the caisse descompte in turgots time the remembrance of laws failure was distinctly felt and impeded the commencement of better attempts
1013188 the credit of the stuart government never recovered from this monstrous robbery and the government created by the revolution of 1688 could hardly expect to be more trusted with money than its predecessor a government created by a revolution hardly ever is there is a taint of violence which capitalists dread instinctively and there is always a rational apprehension that the government which one revolution thought fit to set up another revolution may think fit to pull down in 1694 the credit of william iii s government was so low in london that it was impossible for it to borrow any large sum and the evil was the greater because in consequence of the french war the financial straits of the government were extreme at last a scheme was hit upon which would relieve their necessities the plan says macaulay was that twelve hundred thousand pounds should be raised at what was then considered as the moderate rate of 8 per cent in order to induce the subscribers to advance the money promptly on terms so unfavourable to the public the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the governor and company of the bank of england they were so incorporated and the 1 200 000 l was obtained
1013189 on many succeeding occasions their credit was of essential use to the government without their aid our national debt could not have been borrowed and if we had not been able to raise that money we should have been conquered by france and compelled to take back james ii and for many years afterwards the existence of that debt was a main reason why the industrial classes never would think of recalling the pretender or of upsetting the revolution settlement the fund holder is always considered in the books of that time as opposed to his legitimate sovereign because it was to be feared that this sovereign would repudiate the debt which was raised by those who dethroned him and which was spent in resisting him and his allies for a long time the bank of england was the focus of london liberalism and in that capacity rendered to the state inestimable services in return for these substantial benefits the bank of england received from the government either at first or afterwards three most important privileges
1013190 in the infancy of banking it is probably much better that a government should as a rule keep its own money if there are not banks in which it can place secure reliance it should not seem to rely upon them still less should it give peculiar favour to any one and by entrusting it with the government account secure to it a mischievous supremacy above all other banks
1013191 if the banks are bad they will certainly continue bad and will probably become worse if the government sustains and encourages them the cardinal maxim is that any aid to a present bad bank is the surest mode of preventing the establishment of a future good bank
1013192 under a good system of banking a great collapse except from rebellion or invasion would probably not happen a large number of banks each feeling that their credit was at stake in keeping a good reserve probably would keep one if any one did not it would be criticised constantly and would soon lose its standing and in the end disappear and such banks would meet an incipient panic freely and generously they would advance out of their reserve boldly and largely for each individual bank would fear suspicion and know that at such periods it must show strength if at such times it wishes to be thought to have strength such a system reduces to a minimum the risk that is caused by the deposit if the national money can safely be deposited in banks in any way this is the way to make it safe but this system is nearly the opposite to that which the law and circumstances have created for us in england the english government far from keeping cash from the money market till the position of that market was reasonably secure at a very early moment and while credit of all kinds was most insecure for its own interests entered into the money market in order to effect loans better it gave the custody and profit of its own money along with other privileges to a single bank and therefore practically and in fact it is identified with the bank of this hour it cannot let the money market take care of itself because it has deposited much money in that market and it cannot pay its way if it loses that money
1013193 the english government not only created this singular system but it proceeded to impair it and demoralise all the public opinion respecting it for more than a century after its creation notwithstanding occasional errors the bank of england in the main acted with judgment and with caution its business was but small as we should now reckon but for the most part it conducted that business with prudence and discretion in 1696 it had been involved in the most serious difficulties and had been obliged to refuse to pay some of its notes for a long period it was in wholesome dread of public opinion and the necessity of retaining public confidence made it cautious but the english government removed that necessity in 1797 mr pitt feared that he might not be able to obtain sufficient species for foreign payments in consequence of the low state of the bank reserve and he therefore required the bank not to pay in cash he removed the preservative apprehension which is the best security of all banks for this reason the period under which the bank of england did not pay gold for its notes the period from 1797 to 1819 is always called the period of the bank restriction as the bank during that period did not perform and was not compelled by law to perform its contract of paying its notes in cash it might apparently have been well called the period of bank license but the word restriction was quite right and was the only proper word as a description of the policy of 1797 mr pitt did not say that the bank of england need not pay its notes in specie he restricted them from doing so he said that they must not
1013194 on the whole therefore the position of the chancellor of the exchequer in our money market is that of one who deposits largely in it who created it and who demoralised it he cannot therefore banish it from his thoughts or decline responsibility for it he must arrange his finances so as not to intensify panics but to mitigate them he must aid the bank of england in the discharge of its duties he must not impede or prevent it his aid may be most efficient he is on finance the natural exponent of the public opinion of england and it is by that opinion that we wish the bank of england to be guided under a natural system of banking we should have relied on self interest but the state prevented that we now rely on opinion instead the public approval is a reward its disapproval a severe penalty on the bank directors and of these it is most important that the finance minister should be a sound and felicitous exponent
1013195 the notion that the bank of england has a control over the money market and can fix the rate of discount as it likes has survived from the old days before 1844 when the bank could issue as many notes as it liked but even then the notion was a mistake a bank with a monopoly of note issue has great sudden power in the money market but no permanent power it can affect the rate of discount at any particular moment but it cannot affect the average rate and the reason is that any momentary fall in money caused by the caprice of such a bank of itself tends to create an immediate and equal rise so that upon an average the value is not altered
1013196 in all business this is well known by experience a stimulated market soon becomes a tight market for so sanguine are enterprising men that as soon as they get any unusual ease they always fancy that the relaxation is greater than it is and speculate till they want more than they can obtain
1013197 these considerations enable us to estimate the responsibility which is thrown on the bank of england by our system and by every system on the bank or banks who by it keep the reserve of bullion or of legal tender exchangeable for bullion

1013215 it would take me literally three days to recover from one good training session
1013216 i knew that i would be ready to beat the european record at the olympics but i never imagined that it would happen at our national championships
1013217 i was speechless i still cant really realize what happened yesterday this was a historic moment for austrian swimming to have our first long course european record ever is so amazing

1013219 team selection procedures are clearly spelled out for all athletes who qualify for the trials ultimately it is the usoc that approves and has jurisdiction over the team selection process not usa swimming
1013220 it is fairly difficult to believe that anyone within usa swimming felt the need to plan for a potential positive test
1013221 usa s can put in place whatever process they choose to put swimmers on the team as long as those swimmers meet the a standard

1013226 usa swimming has been notified of the anti doping proceeding involving a u s athlete the matter is being handled by usada and we are hopeful that the matter will be resolved expeditiously out of respect for the hearing process usa swimming will have no further comment at this time
1013227 why in other words do people cheat in situations where there is little to gain one good grade a slight edge in a game and so much to lose this irrationality may be the rule rather than the exception when it comes to cheating according to a group of scholars who have turned their attention to the mysteries of the cheating mind cheating is often thought of as something that is done after cold calculation but the new research has found people are prone to cheat even when it is not in their best interest instead of carefully weighing the costs and benefits of breaking the rules people can be heavily swayed by peer pressure their mood their image of themselves sometimes people even cheat out of a sense of fairness
1013228 clenbuterol has found popularity in bodybuilding and other sports where lean mass is desired athletes generally take a 20 mcg dose 3 times a day for 2 days then go off it for 2 days they repeat this cycle for 6 8 weeks the most prominant short term toxic effects athletes experience is heart palpatations insomnia and muscle cramping the long term side effect would include destruction of the adrenergic receptors permanant impairment of thyroid activity making the athlete unable to regulate his her metabolism and be intolerable to cold temperatures death the amount used by athletes are far less than what livestock are fed and still less than the residual clenbuterol found in meat from animals that were fed clenbuterol
1013229 jacobs one of the nations leading defense lawyers for athletes accused in doping related matters said hardy was tested three times at the trials which concluded july 6 in omaha neb
1013230 man oh man my first day using clen i had 3 pumps
1013231 the first test on july 1 came back negative he said
1013232 hardys attorney howard jacobs confirmed to nbc news that the former cal star tested positive for the banned stimulant clenbuterol
1013233 hardy has never tested positive before her swims at world champs are not in question people are acting like this negates anything she has ever done or will do i disagree
1013234 more damaging however would be her lack of contributions in relay duty
1013235 it is inconsistent with chemical metabolism as ive said before improbable not impossible for her to have had the drug in her body on the 4th but not on the 6th read submitted by swimmd
1013236 don catlin former director of the olympic testing lab at the university of california at los angeles said any amount of clenbuterol in a urine sample is illegal he said it was possible for ms hardy to have a positive test between two negative tests because the drug has a half life of 35 to 40 hours and users can time dosages to the tests and hope the drug will no longer be in their system

1013240 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season he has had a great career with our organization and although we built this year around the assumption that brett meant what he said about retiring brett is coming back we will welcome him back and turn this situation to our advantage frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage brett will be in camp tomorrow although there has been uncertainty regarding bretts return ted thompson and coach mccarthy had previously discussed this and have had a plan in place coach mccarthy will talk to the team and the quarterbacks about the plan moving forward and after he has done that we will share it publicly no matter what i look forward to another successful season for the packers and our fans this has been a tough situation but the packers will make the most of it
1013241 they were very excited a tremendous amount of national pride i mean this is one of the biggest things that has happened to the chinese people in their lifetimes and you could see that on the streets that day
1013242 its a circumstance that she sees as a validation of what the world thinks of what she is and what she has become a major world power a major world player and not simply in the world of sport where she has indeed become very significant but economically politically and diplomatically as well
1013243 its a recognition that china has become one of the great players and in many ways is replacing the once great powers that have more or less declined youve had the decline of france of britain of germany even of russia to a certain degree although russia is trying to make her way back but china sees herself as one of the dominant players in the world in every aspect of world affairs
1013244 what china has poured into the development of china has been dramatic
1013245 china has used this as a very significant means to uplift china to make china visible but also to modernize much of that infrastructure which was necessary for china to continue to compete as we look down to the next several decades into the future some chinese are beginning to say and were hearing this more and more now that the 21st century is going to be the age of china much like the 20th century was the age of america
1013246 what is getting known to the world right now because of the olympics is the lack of human rights in china holding the olympics in china means the worlds eyes are on china and the world will know what human rights abuses there are the reality of chinese rule in tibet will become known to the world we as tibetan people are lucky to have this opportunity to bring our case to the world
1013247 we have a great hope for them that with their great chinese minds their intellect i think they could have a greater understanding with the world advancing of why these issues are important why do they not have a free press why do they not have freedom of access to information they need to ask these questions and i think they will be asking these questions
1013248 these games have also advanced the national spirit and identification of the chinese with china and this is important to the chinese because you have chinese citizens and people spread all across the globe and this is something that will orient them to china and this will only serve to enhance chinas image chinas importance chinas presence
1013249 china is only going to allow those things that it sees as being beneficial to the state and theyre going to continue to maintain controls upon that which one can do theyre not going to change that theyre going to become more subtle perhaps in finding ways to deal with that but theyre not going to allow any of those new modernist forces to ultimately transform china into an open society its still going to be a controlled society people are going to have to obey the authority of the state and this has always been part of the chinese experience dont expect to see a great burgeoning of democratic activity a little bit yes but only insofar as it is going to benefit the state
1013250 the growth of china is spectacular you have to see it to appreciate it i think all young people need to see it because theyre going to become an even bigger factor in the world as we move forward in some respects its very scary in other respects its exciting

1013257 the substantial easing of monetary policy to date should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity
1013258 although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased
1013259 the 19 oil price decline coupled with the steady deterioration in employment and housing figures is an undisputable combination for the fomc to issue a more dovish or less hawkish statement
1013260 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth
1013261 monetary policy makers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth

1013291 we havent endorsed any presidential candidate a big part of one of our social plans is to battle poverty and we would like to see the next president whoever he is cut the poverty rate in half in 10 years much of that money which could be used to help the poor is now being used to fund the wars in afghanistan and iraq the election is an opportunity to shape the public debate and see hard concrete diplomacy bring an end to these wars
1013292 i wish george w bush had listened to his church or at least leaders of his own church
1013293 shortly after the war on terror began we united methodist church administrators had meetings with the pope and with senior officials of the governments of france and russia in those countries to discuss humanitarian ways of ending the war on terror the only place we couldnt get an interview was with the leadership of our own country
1013294 with vietnam many religious groups didnt show their opposition until years after the war started and there was little interfaith work against the war but with the war on terror there has been much more interfaith work among religious leaders and laymen to show that they disagree
1013295 our position was that the iraq war was based on faulty reasons the other problem is with how the war has moved on
1013296 we dont have a solution to the war on terror and we dont say we have a solution we just want muslims civil rights to be respected
1013297 unfortunately there are still many people who dont fully understand us that emotional intensity that many americans had is mostly gone but now these people anti muslim propagandists get their message out in different ways such as the internet
1013298 civil rights organisation not a religious organisation but many of our members are observant muslims
1013299 because we believe that the muslim religion is a misunderstood one so if we need to work with other religions to get the word out that we are a peaceful people thats what we will do

1013382 although essential innovations technology only has a market cap of 1
1013383 if the company moves forward and continues to secure on going private placement equity as it has in the past i am extremely confident that the management team of essential will allocate the resources effectively to execute on the companys strategy of increasing revenue and growth from the manufacturing division
1013384 in my opinion the stock is heavily undervalued and when compared to competitors on the market it has a strong competitive advantage that will allow the company to grow and differentiate itself against competitors

1013430 is the same insert rather rare name here as on our faculty
1013431 there is for me a special significance in signing this pledge and it will give me a peace of mind and heart that i have not experienced since 1968 in 1968 i was a young franciscan priest studying in the graduate school of religious education at catholic university
1013432 since they as well as many other professors and graduate students were signing the protest document i went along and did so also
1013433 in 1975 for personal reasons not related to any doubts or questions about the faith or the church or the religious life i requested and obtained a dispensation from pope paul vi returning me to the lay state later i was married in the church and raised my two children in the faith i have had many conversations with my pastor and with his assistant who is my spiritual director about my days as a franciscan priest and have been active in many of our parishs lay apostolate and ministries
1013434 but i have always regretted having signed the protest document against pope pauls teaching in 1968 and having learned a few years ago that fr faricy had publicly repudiated signing the protest i had wished that i too could repudiate in some official way having signed the protest and so your pledge document offers me an opportunity to correct my mistake and find healing and telling you about all this helps me to feel that my repudiation of the protest is now known and accepted in a kind of semi official sort of way by an authority in the church
1013435 and thank you for reading this thereby humoring an old man who despite everything else knows that he is a priest forever according to the order of melchizedek
1013436 in christs kingdom it is never too late even after forty years to fully embrace the truth all of us make mistakes and all of us sin but he gives us all a chance to be reconciled with him and turn our sorrow into joy

1013484 committee on improvements to financial reporting it was established with a one year life span making good on that timetable the committee issued its final report on friday some of their recommendations
1013485 many individual investors may find a companys periodic reports overly complex and detailed a summary would describe concisely the most important themes or other significant matters with which management is primarily concerned
1013486 develop key performance indicators kpis on an activity and industry basis that would capture important aspects of a companys activities that may not be fully reflected in its financial statements or may be nonfinancial measures
1013487 increasing the field work for proposed standards and formalizing post adoption reviews of new standards as well as periodic assessments of existing standards
1013488 creation of a financial reporting forum frf on which key public and private parties would be represented the frf would meet regularly to discuss the current pressures on the financial reporting system and how constituents are meeting these challenges
1013489 a move away from industry specific guidance in authoritative literature unless justified by strong conceptual arguments a better approach would be to focus on the nature of the business activity itself

1013521 mr brown do you have any idea what might be the cause of the disease
1013522 sure do you know the bulls only screw the cows once a year
1013523 umm sir that is a new piece of information but whats the relationship between this and mad cow
1013524 and did you know we milk the cows twice a day
1013525 getting into the heads of these characters was kind of an ordeal
1013526 the arcs the comedian goes through are substantial to where his very being is questioned and he questions himself
1013527 at first glance you think you are playing this bastard just a mean son of a bitch but the more i looked at the layers to this guy how do you read a book about a guy that does the things he does and yet you sympathize with him how the hell does that happen i found that fascinating
1013528 yes but not the ones you think and it would be counterproductive for me to talk about it
1013529 there are things i wish id urged her to do things i wish i had said things i wish i hadnt said but i am not a racist i never made a racist comment and i didnt attack him personally
1013530 it is a very horrible rumor nothing has changed from yesterday
1013531 and i think now with data like these and as well as lots of other data showing other things are discombobulated in some manner that were now saying well its not something that you just say get over it stiff upper lip away we go
1013532 the datas really compelling that its a neurochemical imbalance what causes the neurochemical imbalance we dont fully comprehend but perhaps this is one of the clues
1013533 what weve said is does this protein that modifies dna is it in higher abundance in people whove committed suicide yes or no the answer was yes
1013534 does the chemical modification that we know this gene does does it occur at a higher frequency the answer is yes does it occur at a higher frequency in a gene that we know already is down regulated in depression and the answer was yes to that as well
1013535 we might be able to have a treatment for depression
1013536 this is a new area of research and this certainly is a nice contribution
1013537 the paper is basically a series of associations so instead of actually showing that x causes y its sort of a relationship between x and y
1013538 that protein itself is interesting and its significant again the difficulty with it is that protein does a lot of different things so that particular protein is involved in a lot of different cellular processes at a number of different genes one of which might be the gene they looked at
1013539 more studies are needed to sort of look at does this protein bind to the region of dna they looked at and does it actually do what theyre saying or is this just an interesting correlation
1013540 we just dont know our best hypothesis is that it might be stress related
1013541 if you know the problem is there you can start addressing the problem
1013542 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
1013543 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
1013544 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
1013545 with no exercise you can take a drug and chemically mimic it

1013550 so if i put log4j 1 2 15 as a dependency that will allow me to use a bugfixed log4j 1 2 15 1 right
1013551 but i will say that the allegations in the media of false and misleading conduct by one auction house has brought to the attention of the market and the regulatory authorities the allegation that there has been bad practice
1013552 that has brought a number of issues to a head
1013553 i believe very strongly that transparency is vital and especially during uncertain economic times its vital we have transparency in the artmarket
1013554 but its quite common to have an industry group and we would be interested in looking at such a body
1013555 but the issues to discuss arenot necessarily connected to the current issues
1013556 until last night it would not have been possible for me to contemplate the level of envy and hostility that exists among certain of my competitors towards mab and particularly myself however all of this is now out in the open our lawyers are carefully studying the transcripts and dvd of the four corners program
1013557 i think everyone has been upset about whats going on
1013558 and i think people are just a bit tired of programs and stories that come out and paint a poor picture of the whole industry
1013559 is constantly coming across new areas of business where there are deceptive practices that are in breach of the law and need to be eradicated
1013560 theres a certain culture or a certain assumption about proper behaviour because of the respectability of the participants in it and the high cultural tones surrounding events that blinds people to the fact that there may be illegal or deceptive behaviour occurring
1013561 its incumbent on the dealers to preserve their reputation to take action themselves to ensure they are acting with absolute honesty
1013562 it passed through auction three times at his auction houses and at least twice he was the owner
1013563 this is thething that should be made illegal because there is only one reason why youd sell something that you own and buy it through an entity that you partly or wholly own yourself and thats market distortion
1013564 people will not accept substitutes they become locked in on a single item and that means theyre prepared to pay more this creates an opportunity for the seller to raise the price far more than if it was in a market with competing substitutes even coco cola cant raise its price too much because some people will switch to pepsi art seems unique
1013565 it comes down to passion the passion to want it i think consumers can tend to let their hearts rule their heads in too many cases
1013566 any sense of their long term career development would find those kind of practices extremely problematic
1013567 the prices are not only a reflection of the quality of the work but an indication of their reputation if theres a huge amount of volatility they would be asking themselves what does this mean about how the buying public regards me because over the course of a lifetime what theyre trying to do is to build a consistent reputation
1013568 i felt terribly frustrated because i love competition im a competitive person from the moment i open my eyes to the moment i go to sleep at night
1013569 i read yesterday that 36 per cent of british muslims believe apostates should be put to death but in many islamic countries it is 80 or 90 per cent
1013570 in a way i am lucky i have the privilege of being protected from the islamists who want to murder me but what about the people who dont have protection who are murdered or blown up in the street in india or turkey or iraq
1013571 this is a war that is being waged both internally and externally it is waged against people within the islamic world who are seen as infidels or as hypocrites who are not strong enough in their islamic faith and it is also waged against the west
1013572 i was inspired to write the book after september 11
1013573 i followed intently the debate in books on television in newspapers and it became clear to me that there were three fundamental incompatibilities between islam and the west and three philosophers whose work i had read and admired each of whom wrote about one of these issues
1013574 the great thing about hayek is his proposition that the individuals life is here on earth not in the hereafter
1013575 the collective have to not just accommodate the idea of freedom but create institutions that protect the freedom of the individual and every individual must learn that my freedom ends where yours begins
1013576 for muslims to change to hayeks point of view they have to acknowledge that collectivism has failed
1013577 and that has been what every reformer has said for 1400 years
1013578 your prime minister still has to do a bit of reading i guess
1013579 i havent read the article so i can only comment on what you say but if that is that is what he said he is wrong about hayek hayeks argument is that because there is competition because individuals are free to choose who to trade with and under what circumstances and because the free market under the rule of law is a regulated market it works not that it is perfect but that it is better than any other system hayeks criticism of the theory that you need a larger government a bureaucratic hand the well meaning socialist to guide us in achieving social justice and in sharing income is who are these people hayek also shows that in all the places where socialism and its more extreme form communism have been tried they failed terribly
1013580 hayek says that the human being is free to choose who to associate with as a woman you can choose who your spouse is i dont see how hayeks views corrode family life in any way both individuals and the children are equal before the law
1013581 popper examines plato in the first volume and then leaps straight to hegel and marx missing out mohammed in the middle
1013582 im not going to say anything offensive about islam i once said that mohammed was a pervert and a tyrant i got into trouble for that and im not going to do that again i just want to set out the ideas of islam and in this case the relationship between the individual and the collective or the ummah as muslims call it
1013583 i can see very striking similarities between marxist arguments and mohammedan arguments
1013584 its all about social justice about the poor and the orphans and the downtrodden
1013585 ideas are very powerful ideas inspire people to do things i think its good to have the ideas of western liberal society and islam put starkly side by side so the reader can see why they are incompatible
1013586 john stuart mill wrote at a time when gender relations were set in stone it so happened that the womans position was the less pleasant one their education was limited to preparing them to be wives and mothers and hostesses it was never as bad as in the time of mohammed and im not comparing the two
1013587 mohammed lived in a time when girls were buried before the age of seven men could have as many wives as they wanted he was the first to set up some rules to limit men to four wives to say that infanticide should be stopped he decreed that women could inherit and gave them a small share
1013588 all mill is going to argue is that educated women are better for society why societies that free women from the shackles of tradition are more successful than societies that do not do that
1013589 mohammed is going to present his ideas and criticise western societies ideas you see in the current literature by radical muslims why they think the western woman is a slave of advertising and fashion and the working woman has got the worst of both worlds
1013590 i dont think it matters that he has in his very short career a left liberal record
1013591 morph appspace is a complete package with all of the features that we need it works so well its become our standard deployment platform for everything we develop
1013592 morph appspace makes it absolutely effortless for a company like ours to develop and deploy web 2 0 applications using ruby on rails
1013593 we have deployed our own software as a service in the past but found it was not an effective use of time using morph has dramatically simplified the application deployment and management process its not only a safe and straightforward hosting environment it also provides a real time monitor of activity that allows us to assess use
1013594 the success of mytripscrapbook demonstrates how morph saves time and money for small to medium size businesses and isvs that are looking to develop applications
1013595 its a great example of how morph appspace subscriptions can seamlessly deploy an application to thousands of users with the capacity to scale to millions of users

1013597 we dish out our best points and he rips them apart
1013598 getting public opinion on our opinions and getting feedback from across the country is really cool
1013599 they show that collaboration can feed into competition in a very positive way
1013600 we want to increase peoples awareness of american history and we want the youth watching
1013601 im jumping on the bobby abreu train lets hope im not a week late
1013602 a young guy who gets a shot and in my hometown no less
1013603 even though carlos quentin may have gotten me negative points a couple weeks back im going to go back to the white sox and take jermaine dye
1013604 we were extremely pleased with our performance for the quarter which was driven by a 68 percent increase in sales at our cardiovascular division year over year
1013605 this was the positive factor that i saw the local market defied the dow jones and the regional market
1013606 the markets performance might still continue driven by companies positive earning results
1013607 there was no heavy local and foreign buying although the local market acted stronger than expected this showed that investors continue to remain cautious
1013608 the milf is committed to resolving the issue in a peaceful manner the front will exhaust all alternative options such as bringing our cause to the international court or to the united nations
1013609 for the meantime lets leave it to the peace panels of both the government and the milf to react
1013610 they will still be meeting and im sure they will discuss the latest development
1013611 it puts us in an embarrassing situation in the international community
1013612 we submit to the sound discretion of the supreme court as it is the ultimate arbiter of issues the signing would have to be cancelled it is a good opportunity for issues to be threshed out
1013613 there is no derailment here its just a postponement of signing and we welcome the process in the supreme court because there the issues will be discussed with objectivity and dispassionately
1013614 confident that the supreme court will uphold position of the peace panel in crafting this momentous historic agreement that will address the long standing problem of mindanao and the country as whole
1013615 if the signing does not push through and the milf feels betrayed we are looking at the escalation of conflict in mindanao
1013616 everyone agrees with the generics peace development empowerment of bangsamoro people but the devil is in the details the problem here is that the government negotiated with the rebel group without consulting civil society and the local governments
1013617 i think it was all teed up as a bone on the eve of arroyos state of the nation address i think it was strictly done for that purpose
1013618 the banks basic interest differential business remains on track while service based fee income continues to be supported by strong volume growth
1013619 however the bottom line was impacted by lower trading gains arising from an adverse investment setting
1013620 c ontinued market volatility and higher domestic interest rates limited trading opportunities and resulted in mark to market losses on the banks investment portfolio
1013621 this year we are currently finishing our 24th outlet and we hope to end the year with 30 stores
1013622 its a good meeting place and also a more cost efficient alternative to meeting in hotels and restaurants
1013623 ive been buying more coffee this year because my weekend nightouts with friends have become more frequent
1013624 i would rather have something more filling than coffee for the price i pay for it
1013625 i like going to coffee shops for the company and conversation
1013626 is very important to finally put an end to the mindanao problem in a political settlement
1013627 my position is that i dont believe in the postponement but i believe in the peace process definitely the postponement is dead in the water
1013628 i regret that it came too late the senate is a deliberative body it would be seemingly impossible for such an important bill to be approved theres a lot of explaining to do not only with the postponement but also with the agreement
1013629 this issue requires very serious constitutional analysis there are so many ifs in this agreement i dont think you can shorten the period when polls are suspended
1013630 unless you negotiating panel know something that we legislators dont know
1013631 creating an impression that the government would give in to any of their request
1013632 theres contradiction here they are rushing the signing but they asked for the postponement in the elections can you imagine it postpone the elections but rush the signing
1013633 shows our government is acting like a hostage of the milf why does the government have to give in to milfs demand milf is not mindanao and mindanao is not milf
1013634 constitutional amendments are a possibility in order to bring about the commitments stated in the agreement
1013635 malaysia may well be advised that the supposed moa is flawed and will face constitutional and legal challenges in the senate and in the courts forewarned is forearmed
1013636 the elections are not incompatible with the arrangement with the milf
1013637 there wont be a new government there for at least three years if we dont hold elections
1013638 they probably wont be able to disturb the peace in the whole of mindanao
1013639 while we are closely monitoring the developments wed rather leave it to the wisdom of the concerned government agencies and the opap office of the presidential adviser on the peace process because we are not part of the decision making process
1013640 the increase in the prices of petroleum products is very telling of the inflation rate increase for july the decline of rice prices is positive but thats not enough
1013641 oil prices are falling but its not just like that 120 per barrel is stilldouble from year ago a hike of about 80 in oil prices is still a big increase
1013642 inflation is likely to ease in the fourth quarter the momentum and the trend right now is on the upside its a global trend
1013643 the credibility of the central bank will give confidence to the market even if inflation is high if the central bank shows that its doing something the market will remain calm
1013644 country specific factors such as a 10 increase in government wages in july the ongoing roll out of private sector minimum wage increments and higher public transport fares will exacerbate the inflation reading
1013645 however we continue to expect inflation to moderate towards the end of the year
1013646 hey guys i asked bird if hed ever sleep with me
1013647 i still hang out with bird every once in a while and am no longer wanting to get him in my pants its subtly different from wanting to get in his pants except when something sets my hormones raging

1013688 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
1013689 it seems clear that the majority of maternal deaths in the united states are not preventable the most common preventable errors in preeclampsia management leading to maternal death involved inattention to blood pressure control and signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema those involving postpartum hemorrhage deaths were related to inadequate surgical hemostasis in all these cases more prompt attention to clinical signs of hemorrhage and associated hypovolemia would also have prevented death

1013858 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1013859 there is no doubt that the syrian regime is in a bad and complex situation there is no doubt that muhammed suleiman was one of the closest people to president bashar assad and his right hand in the armed forces
1013860 he knew everything and all issues were open to him including the security economic and armament issues
1013861 suleimans status exceeded his military rank and therefore he had no political aspirations his status was even more important than that of the defense minister
1013862 in the meantime however it is hard to determine the reasons behind the assassination we must wait three or four more days for things to become clear particularly when we are talking about an accurate assassination which was carried out by a sniper firing from the sea

1013868 what the chief of staff meant to say was that we know gilad shalit is being held by hamas in the gaza strip his remark offers no new information
1013869 after we complete our recruit service and advanced training we will reach our line but in the meantime gilad shalit is in captivity and this is a very disturbing issue
1013870 there is no doubt that we have to bring him back exert every effort in regards to this issue
1013871 i cant say i am pleased but we completed the mission in the north and returned eldad regev and ehud goldwasser unfortunately not alive but we returned them to a jewish grave i cant go into details but efforts are being exerted on the gilad shalit issue on all levels

1013915 theres the perception that the company will raid the capital of one business to pay for the losses in the other

1013941 in 1789 after the bourgeois revolution the smallest french peasants benefited from the upheaval but it is a commonplace to observe and to say that in the majority of cases for ninety five per cent of the population of under developed countries independence brings no immediate change the enlightened observer takes note of the existence of a kind of masked discontent like the smoking ashes of a burnt down house after the fire has been put out which still threatens to burst into flames again
1013942 o saldo da corrida em londrina foi muito positivo para a nossa equipe
1013943 o campeonato ficou mais embolado depois desta sexta etapa pelo que vimos at agora neste ano a tend ncia que estes cinco primeiros pilotos continuem brigando ponto a ponto at a corrida final do ano em bras lia

1013949 eu viajava o ano todo com apenas um treinador este ano passei a ter tr s pessoas comigo cada semana um t cnico um fisioterapeuta e um preparador f sico todos se deram bem e me apoiaram bastante
1013950 antes eu achava realmente dificil viajar sete oito meses por ano com apenas uma pessoa achava muito estressante agora estou bem mais descontra do fora de quadra e vou a cada jogo com um bom estado de esp rito em vez de ficar pensando sobre o que se passa fora de quadra

1013980 you are dealing with people who died we are also dealing with people who are still alive
1013981 you should take into account not only the problem of justice but also the problem of peace together would be very useful
1013982 we think that this decision should be examined clearly because we are here in africa and the troops who are here are africans those who are dying are africans
1013983 the rest of the world should help us in understanding the problems we are facing in the field

1014029 senator obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1014030 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point
1014031 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency

1014059 but just like in 1990 when we had the last big real estate crisis the system will bend but not break when the sky is falling you have to have the guts to buy but buy slowly
1014060 if its an asset allocation question i personally believe you should tilt toward growth maybe 60 to 40 but not 100
1014061 it took three to four years to work our way out of that economic mess

1014075 but there must be a good reason for one it must not be a stunt if there is a great story with each man at different places in their respective lives but remember that part of the story would only last for eight minutes so it must be a hell of a plot for this small segment of the doctors to show up

1014108 look let me talk about the broader issue this whole notion that i am shifting to the center
1014109 the people who say this apparently havent been listening to me
1014110 and i must say some of this is my friends on the left
1014111 no amount of advertising claiming that blue is red and that amnesties are not amnesties apparently could fool the voters this time
1014112 was without a doubt the greatest electoral victory of the immigration control movement
1014113 clearly there are some out there who hate me and every stinking one of them voted

1014124 while increasing rewards does not necessarily lead to solving the case it does lead to new information which is what we are seeking
1014125 they think if it has happened once or twice in the past few years then it has got a high likelihood of happening to my child
1014126 so they start to over protect their children by not letting them out of their sight and the message they send is the world is quite a dangerous place
1014127 if they dont have the skills to deal with it then sometimes their solution will be to turn to drugs or alcohol
1014128 kids need to get out and have their own space sometimes
1014129 my family has taught me about stranger danger and if im somewhere they always remind me not to muck around too much and to be wary of where i go and what i do
1014130 im very open to the possibility of something out there but i wanted to explore the paradox of reporting something thats identified as unidentified
1014131 weve had a few reports from farmers around the grampians who have seen lights doing strange things in the sky and on the mountains
1014132 i left a message on his phone saying youve done something stupid
1014133 i said youve got to work hard now to win back respect
1014134 hes family and we still love him but hes done something stupid
1014135 the law of the land is there and he will get the full brunt of the law and he deserves to and he knows that
1014136 fining a bloke like heath who is on fairly big money doesnt hurt
1014137 eddie mcguire espouses that he believes in law and order and that drink driving is a crime hes always the first to come out and make a public statement but when it comes to the crunch at his own football club its double standards
1014138 would eddie drop this guy if he had injured someone or worse it sends a good message to the collingwood membership that its ok to drink and drive so long as you are a collingwood footballer
1014139 they are role models these guys and should pay a higher price but collingwood has its own rules when it comes to drink driving and obviously the rest of the community has to sing to a different tune
1014140 the easiest thing in the world for our club is to send him down to play in the vfl reserves and he gets off the hook
1014141 what we want him to do now is start his rehabilitation people can say it is just being selfish because we are playing we are about to play in a finals game and its a big game against st kilda
1014142 well our supporters deserve these professional people to do their job properly
1014143 had they been youngsters on the fringe of selection i might have thought a playing ban was in order

1014146 didak and the shaw brothers were with about three younger players
1014147 then i heard the news of the crash in the morning and thought i know where those boys were last night
1014148 they were over in the corner trying to be inconspicuous i tried to speak to didak but he didnt want to talk he wasnt interested so i just said have a good night
1014149 they were all there when i left about 10 15pm and im pretty sure they were all drinking
1014150 ben johnson was the only collingwood player who was behaving himself

1014241 for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
1014242 the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
1014243 after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
1014244 giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality

1014247 this research provides a better characterization of the variables at the cellular circuit and behavioral level that contribute to the persistent nature of addictive disorders
1014248 the researchers were able to illuminate why drug related memories are so stable
1014249 their persistence is highly refractory to new learning which makes our jobs that much tougher and reminds us that treatment must recognize and address the high propensity for relapse almost anywhere down the road
1014250 these results indicate that the ltp induced by self administered cocaine is more persistent than that produced by natural rewards such as food and that the ltp is not just a result of exposure to cocaine but also is linked to the drugs effects and the animals learning to obtain the drug
1014251 these are important distinctions that will help us better understand how addiction develops and why drugs can overshadow other natural rewards and become the mainstay of an addicted persons life

1014511 the international olympic committee and the beijing games plunged deeper into controversy yesterday after a senior ioc official was forced to admit the ioc had cut a deal with chinese authorities to allow them to block access to a wide range of websites during the games
1014512 the admission stunned free speech advocates in asia europe and north america triggering accusations that the ioc was
1014513 but yesterday an embarrassed ioc press chair kevan gosper acknowledged he had learned through a beijing olympic organizing committee press conference that the chinese would censor the internet and on further inquiry he discovered his own organization was complicit in the plan
1014514 its just one more example that shows how the chinese governments commitment in 2001 to allow free media was just a weak promise and in some ways they had no real intention to provide normal working conditions for journalists covering the games
1014515 in new york bob dietz of the committee to protect journalists was astonished
1014516 china and the ioc promised that this would not happen
1014517 if journalists access to the internet is restricted in any way its a failure of both parties to meet the promises they made to the world i dont think the ioc knew who they were getting into bed with
1014518 in hong kong nicholas bequelin of human rights watch said
1014519 the paranoia of the chinese government overrules the accepted systems used by the international community this has tarnished the olympic movement severely
1014520 the websites of all three organizations reporters without borders the committee to protect journalists and human rights watch are banned and blocked in china as is that of amnesty international which issued a scathing attack on china this week accusing the government of using the games as a pretext to crack down even harder on perceived threats to stability
1014521 i was unlawfully imprisoned one hundred twenty falun gong practitioners were jailed on one floor they were unlawfully imprisoned for telling others about the persecution of falun gong most of them were sentenced to 7 to 18 years of imprisonment

1014523 most chinese are unaware of any of the above because independent information about falun gong remains blocked inside china

1014525 for the past 9 years the falun gong practitioners have suffered under the largest most violent persecution that the chinese people have seen in decades

1014535 ive been in rooms with bodies rotting there for a week and it never stunk that bad

1014540 the pile of dirty diapers in that room must have been 4 feet high
1014541 the glass in the window had been broken and that child was just lying there surrounded by her own excrement and bugs
1014542 i put her over my shoulder and that diaper started leaking down my leg

1014547 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children
1014548 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort
1014549 failure to pass a tax extenders bill will jeopardize our ability to compete and succeed both at home and abroad

1014584 big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2m in contributions
1014585 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1014586 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies
1014587 the obama assertion that he can take off the table
1014588 and somehow relieve the us of its dependence on foreign oil shows he either doesnt understand what hes saying or hes not being straight with the american people
1014589 it is sad that of those who have lost their lives women and children numbered the most i can understand what would be going through their families

1014598 had to be done in private clinics that accepted no federal grants but instead got all of their money from client fees
1014599 byproduct of the ban was that nih and ethics committees had no mechanism for regulating research in these private clinics
1014600 wholly unintentionally the u s ban on federal funding jump started innovation in assisted reproduction
1014601 wound up creating one of the fastest growing areas of american medicine fueled in part by competing private clinics
1014602 too expensive or frivolous and critics thought that would halt the practice altogether
1014603 e arly on critics doubted that couples would pay for ivf especially if their chances of creating a baby were low
1014604 fortunately couples enjoy the freedom to spend their money as they choose to buy reproductive help
1014605 comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices and whats even worse than the shift itself yes sometimes compromise is necessary is the ridiculous claim that it will bring gas prices down its never necessary to say something you know isnt true
1014606 repeal tax breaks for oil companies so that we can invest billions in fuel efficient cars help our automakers re tool and make a genuine commitment to renewable sources of energy like wind power solar power and the next generation of clean affordable biofuels
1014607 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1014608 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
1014609 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
1014610 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
1014611 the licence is another opportunity to create a sought after laptop which is also affordable to the younger football supporting generation
1014612 this is a desirable product for any england football fan we strive to give consumers new product choices to show their support for the national football team
1014613 you also have to be good at getting consumers on and off the network
1014614 it took 100 years to get 1 billion devices on the network
1014615 it will take less than 10 years to get the next billion
1014616 do i feel good about where i am right now yes do i feel i have a long term solution no but its something im watching every day
1014617 i was among the many who took barack obamas statements that he would

1014629 dick snyder was running s and s back then and he really did believe in the free market of ideas
1014630 i was pretty much free to acquire anyone i wanted
1014631 i brought them books by bill buckley and charles kessler
1014632 and also sidney hook who was hardly a conservative but felt like one to the lefties at harper but of course they were names every time i brought up someone they hadnt heard of they would say no brad we want to do conservative books just not this one there really was no conception of the size of the potential market or what the country was like it was like the famous steinberg drawing with new york as the center of the world that odd liberal version of reality
1014633 youd think the industry would have learned something from the success of so many free press authors and the closing of the american mind
1014634 but no they resisted trying to seriously get into this market for another 15 years
1014635 been taking on fewer books and become a lot more selective this year well publish only five or six including mike huckabees book down from ten a few years ago we want to keep the imprint as robust as possible but the way to do that is not simply to keep our output up and pretend the market is what it was three years ago
1014636 the lesson weve learned or actually relearned is that there are no hard and fast rules in this business aside from the fact youve got to be smart creative and persistent
1014637 theres a conservative market out there and its not going away
1014638 it became an anthropological question for them who are these people there followed a whole cottage industry of books and articles trying to prove that conservatives are a product of bad parenting psychological syndromes or genetic defects as well as generally stupid and evil
1014639 and report so and so passed then read me the note from the editor it would say things like this is well written but the premise doesnt make any sense liberal bias whats
1014640 a conservative publisher i felt a little funny about that
1014641 this idea that a regnery book is somehow illegitimate is just incredible bs why is it that were supposed to be concerned about regnery being a conservative house but nobody worries about all the publishers in manhattan being liberal houses it scares me even thinking about what wouldve happened if id gone with one of those houses the book wouldve come and gone in a minute and sold exactly no copies
1014642 they initially printed only 13 000 copies and as far as i know gave it no advertising
1014643 amazon sold out the third day and we got hundreds of e mails from all over the country from people that couldnt find it in the stores which just killed it commercially the truth is the house just never seemed very excited about the book
1014644 but jonah was an internet star and in the first week the demand from his troops was so intense that it jumped onto the times s list with 12 000 copies in print even then doubleday just eked the book out into the marketplace reprinting in quantities of 5 000 or 10 000 if this had been a book by a major liberal journalist they would have gone out with 30 000 copies and reprinted in increments of 20 000 and we would have been up to 150 000 in no time with huge stacks in barnes and noble even when jonahs book hit number one it still wasnt easily obtainable youd walk into a barnes and noble and if they had it at all it would be tucked away on the second floor in the back in the sociology section eventually they pushed the book up to 198 000 copies i would like to have seen 300 000 in print
1014645 everybody reads the new york times every day and takes it as orthodoxy signing books on that basis it was evident very quickly how insular the whole system is they could all name three four five chefs but couldnt name a single clergyman
1014646 im sitting there in my office and a young editorial assistant walks in
1014647 all i can say is im very sorry for your loss which is what you say at a funeral right
1014648 each of these companies has its own ann coulter pat buchanan or bill oreilly
1014649 too many people even in the industry buy into the caricature that conservative publishing is all about polemics weve published memoirs like bob novaks the prince of darkness and michael medveds right turns serious works of history investigative journalists like bill gertz and ken timmerman not to mention the george wills and michael barones of the world
1014650 reasoned thoughtful and made an enormous contribution to the debate in the public arena
1014651 if we could have had a generalized debate in the culture if cnn had been willing to cover the subject the way fox did the impact could have been so much greater
1014652 fox was all over this like a cheap suit but fox is behind a firewall
1014653 you have to prepare them for whats going to going to get the bad review in pw followed by the indignant column by paul krugman but you have to let them know that in this case bad is good we need our enemies we cherish them we use the new york times to energize conservative media i send every book i publish to times columnist frank rich with a nice note saying i hope you hate this one unfortunately theyve gotten a little more savvy about being used that way and tend not to respond thats why i miss anthony lewis he could never restrain himself
1014654 oprah is not one of the places we go for our books
1014655 the approach has paid off though regnery produces only 20 to 25 titles annually of the 72 conservative books that have been on the
1014656 my own feeling is that these imprints are designed to fail
1014657 management would be happy to see them succeed for financial reasons yet because they basically see this type of publishing as deeply distasteful an alien organism within the publishing body theyd be just as happy if they fail then they could say see we tried this kind of publishing is not a good business and move on
1014658 the large publishing houses have always held their noses when it comes to conservative imprints
1014659 my guess is that if they survive at all theyll transition from conservative politics to just politics and current events
1014660 the truth is theres never been real commitment to the ideas in those books or for that matter to genuine intellectual pluralism once its clear the winds shifted and theyre less profitable its a good bet theyll be gone
1014661 mainstream publishers to stop seeing conservatives as a market to be ghettoized and exploited but as a vital part of the american tapestry but
1014662 i also think conservatives are also going to have to adjust get smarter argue better and write more with an intention to persuade rather than just mock belittle and demonize
1014663 there will be room for a lot of different voices
1014664 the problem for contemporary liberals is that they really dont understand it applies to them
1014665 if you put more teeth into it it might be more effective
1014666 i certainly feel that in a lot of those cases the process has helped settle cases ahead of time and reduced costs and kept them out of court
1014667 ja aber ich m chte weitere ger te weitere befehle hinzuf gen
1014668 smoking fewer cigarettes is an approved strategy of smoking cessation in some european countries however in the united states it is not widely applied
1014669 our study demonstrates that most smokers can successfully overcome their nicotine addiction by gradually lowering the number of cigarettes they smoke daily our review also proves that cutting back can be a very successful strategy to change smoking habits and eventually quit smoking altogether
1014670 china is a nation in transition with a great future tremendous potential and some challenges
1014671 it is our hope that through the games we can show the world the sincere aspiration of the chinese people to share the benefits of development and to join with the rest of the world in building a bright future

1014675 i mean obviously the coaches know what theyre talking about
1014676 why on earth do we need to waste time and money playing the season now gas is four freaking dollars a gallon
1014677 why should we waste that kind of money on a trip to baton rouge tempe or auburn since were already national champions
1014678 i agree with dr adams that it probably is superfluous for us to play the season
1014679 i mean we finished 2 last year and the 1 team lsu lost its top two quarterbacks game over baby
1014680 did you see that it was bulls they dont deserve a freebee championship
1014681 by the way im writing a book about it there are seven chapters devoted to their little endzone dance i was really tissues about the whole thing
1014682 well yeah clearly some sec team will beat them again this year in miami
1014683 oh my cake looks nothing like grandma i am sure you will note like it
1014684 now when i was a little chap i had a passion for maps
1014685 sitting in the clubhouse watching that last brewers cubs game thursday they mentioned our rotation and they were more concerned about campillo and his changeup
1014686 this is a good hitting team theyre aggressive they like to hit the fastball and he kept them off balance all day with the changeup and the slider
1014687 i knew he was looking for something off speed and i wanted to try my front door cutter
1014688 if we could find a guy like that every year wed be doing something hes been just dynamic i love to watch him pitch he can carve up a hitter as good as anybody
1014689 there was some confusion because i missed friday all i had was my white jersey and i was on the red squad we didnt realize it until 10 minutes before we took the field so i just put on the jersey with no name on it
1014690 this was the first time that weve gone through the communication process of having our coaches up in the booth substitutions and the sequencing of a game
1014691 we tried to put them in as many different situations as we could but we also got some work with our players
1014692 the real thing was the dry run for the coaching staff and the players going through the pregame warm up how we do introductions and at halftime how things were going to take place in those 12 minutes we basically staged all of that for them today
1014693 we were down in numbers so there were some guys that had been working with the first team that were running with the other side
1014694 i told players beforehand dont read anything into the depth chart for this game
1014695 its just a continuation of building a relationship with the fans and our community to give them an opportunity to have access to our team and our players
1014696 dave cohen vice president of sales is here with his staff to show any seats that are available hopefully well have some fans buy some tickets as well
1014697 there are no words sad doesnt do it justice i will always remember skip for his humor and his ability to go about life the way he did i gained so much respect for what he did and how long he did and how he did
1014698 i figured skip caray is as much a part of atlanta braves baseball as any of us
1014699 we all grew up listening to skip whether it be on tv or radio any time the guys on espn imitate you calling the highlights youre pretty much a legend from a fans standpoint hes going to be a huge loss for them because he relayed the games to fans for so long
1014700 he always made a note to come by my locker and shake my hand ask me how i was doing how the family was how my kids were
1014701 personally over the last 15 16 17 years i havent gotten his play by play on the radio or tv but i had a lot of plane flight conversations with him i really respected him as well as the whole caray family they have a pretty good legacy working over there its a sad day for braves baseball
1014702 this was completely unexpected and is a complete loss i had just spoken with skip this week when we did the radio show and i didnt know he wasnt feeling well he seemed in his normal good spirits weve all lost a very good friend for me he was a good buddy at the park and away from the park we always had a lot of great laughs he will be very sorely missed
1014703 but behind the humor there was an honesty and a commitment to telling it like he believed it to be that never ever varied
1014704 if he didnt like it that a game was two minutes late getting started everybody knew about it if he had an opinion on a player he said it and he had a way of saying it that was sometimes humorous the way he could take a bad ball game in some of those bad years especially and turn it into a fun broadcast whether it was by talking about something in the game or whether it was talking about something that didnt have anything to do with the game maybe it was a movie that was coming up after the game or maybe it was a restaurant that hed gone to it could have been anything he was just a very entertaining broadcaster and a very good one the game was still the most important thing but if game was decided by the fourth or fifth inning people would still watch the rest of the game just to hear what he had to say about things thats a very very unique ability
1014705 regardless of how much you prepare yourself for it youre always surprised
1014706 skip of late seemed to be doing a lot better his immediate future was off of everybodys minds its a surprise a shock
1014707 we were able to joke around with one another laugh at one another and we also had a mutual respect for one another
1014708 ill miss that seeing him around the game taking a jab or two
1014709 for so long he was what people associated with the atlanta braves
1014710 turn on tbs and there was skip good times bad times that was the constant the voice people identify the braves with is skip caray thats going to be missed
1014711 not only are the braves losing somebody special from their organization baseball is too
1014712 its wild how when somebody spends so much time in one organization and has had the history that hes had its very difficult to have it abruptly end especially while hes doing it
1014713 unfortunately he ended up dying doing something he loved itll be a tough day a tough week
1014714 i thought they didnt want me i thought they lied so i wouldnt go anywhere else but i talked with coach john jancek and he said they wanted me and thats why they made me their first offer i was just playing games in my mind
1014715 the trend will continue where college teams will be more than halfway full before the season starts and by sept 1 youd better be out recruiting juniors or youre way behind
1014716 you dont want to be a fool and wait for the big school when its not coming
1014717 theres risk in waiting you dont want to lose an offer you already have but you dont want to give up on that dream school either
1014718 for one he hasnt been down there for a visit and checked out what its all about
1014719 i told him that if they want you now and you go out and have the kind of season you think you can what makes you think they wont want you then
1014720 we need our summers coaches our families the players the high school coaches even our academic advisers
1014721 our academic advisers are on call all summer when an official visit walks in town we all need to take a little break
1014722 would end all this mockery when you have a guy sitting there with six hats
1014723 recruiting is getting crazy with all the publicity and the hype and the early commitments
1014724 you know we have some kids that theyd love to have but theres no way based on how they did my kids last year
1014725 he told us he was willing to take his commitment right now then he paused
1014726 then he followed with of course you dont have to make a decision now darren knows not to say anything weve got an understanding
1014727 you take a test in spring training when youre feeling good
1014728 this gives you a gauge on how you feel when you take it its reaction time remembering things stuff like that
1014729 i was told id be out six weeks with the knee injury now this is dragging out toward 10 weeks
1014730 i know its a new injury but i didnt count on that and its mentally draining
1014731 the offseason is kind of a long process with mat drills and spring practice and summer workouts but thats all working up to this point its going to be hot out there we all know it but its helps you get mentally tough and were looking forward to getting as good as we can get
1014732 the process is whats important how you go about your business is important thats what we have to focus on to be in position to win anything
1014733 being the leader of this team i believe its my responsibility to get the guys ready
1014734 here in practice is the best time to do it youre not going to show up on the 30th and be ready to play without putting some time and effort into it thats what you do now
1014735 we lost some guys some guys are moving its hard to tell what well look like
1014736 weve got an idea of who the seven or eight guys will be battling to be in the five and it will be determined out there on the practice field but im confident in them i know trinton sturdivants going to be my left tackle and i know chris davis is going to be in there somewhere i know everybody out there can play i think were going to be fine
1014737 i knew that he had been battling some health issues but i was just really shocked and saddened when i got the e mail
1014738 skip saw the funny side of things and enjoyed making people laugh when we werent giving them too much to smile about during some of those years that i was with the braves
1014739 the man never sugar coated anything if the braves were playing terribly he told you many people who work for teams or have covered them for a long time dont have the guts and integrity to do that
1014740 i remember one time when we were both with the hawks skip got me to join him before a game at the old omni club hed have two or three drinks but he could pull it off
1014741 he could get away with things other people couldnt he could be a loose cannon but he was collegial and that mix really worked well in the south that broadcasting team him and ernie johnson and pete van wieren they were the personality of the team they were the people fans most identified with
1014742 the last time i did it for him two weeks ago he said chip does a better impression of me he always took it well
1014743 he called it like a fan but he was nobodys mouthpiece he never tried to be anything he wasnt
1014744 yes yes yes the atlanta braves have given you a championship listen to this crowd
1014745 you have our permission to turn off the tv and go to bed now as long as you promise to patronize our sponsors
1014746 i got to talk to him yesterday and i told him i loved him and he started laughing because i was stuck in new york
1014747 it was our own private little joke i at least got to tell him i loved him which was the last thing i said to him so im grateful for that
1014748 i hope and pray hes sitting on a barstool somewhere with his dad arguing about baseball and his mom and his brother who he misses dearly i hope hes at peace because i know he wasnt the last couple years and he battled and fought and didnt do a whole lot of complaining he knew he wrote some checks that were getting cashed and he didnt complain about it once
1014749 you know intellectually that youre exhausted but so what concentrate on the game i know this im not going to embarrass myself if i cant do this ill be the first to know it ive had a hell of a run so ive got nothing to complain about if i die tonight ive had a great life
1014750 the bases are loaded again and i wish i was too
1014751 ive just kind of grabbed on to the people of atlanta and theyve made me feel at home
1014752 i wanted to be judged for my own ability my own style
1014753 its like we were on the first wagon train west
1014754 we didnt know where we were going but we were having a lot of fun getting there
1014755 the people all over the country who send you christmas cards every year the people who when dad passed 5 000 of them sent notes or condolence cards when i lost my brother the people all over the country who sent condolence cards as well how do you thank those people and how do you say goodbye to those people
1014756 we dont want to get all maudlin here but thank you folks and god bless you and were going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us
1014757 ive got to be able to say ive worked with all of them
1014758 i just hope i dont cry to be honest with you
1014759 my dad always told me to be honest on the air and to be yourself dont try to be anybody else
1014760 to go through it again with an even bigger meet will be absolutely thrilling
1014761 she was the first one in the van going to the pool and that has never happened
1014762 usually the girl still looking for her credential and bathing suit is the kathleen i know
1014763 we all agreed when we met early on that this was about going the distance
1014764 it was its not a question of if she goes to beijing
1014765 its kind of weird when i made the team it was the most elated i ever felt about my swimming
1014766 but at the same time it was this was it
1014767 we put that ball in her court when she was in the seventh or eighth grade
1014768 my dad has always overcome so many obstacles it makes you feel theres nothing you cant do
1014769 she was picking her head up out of the water with every stroke and smiling at everyone
1014770 just the challenge of getting from one end to the other first fastest when were not even really supposed to be in the water
1014771 i wore a watch to class a few times and i would be saying to myself on the 30 we should be doing this like i was at practice
1014772 you become obsessive compulsive and it takes over your life
1014773 my dad and eric kind of represent what swimming is about which is perseverance
1014774 its also about racing and loving what you do but you mostly have to have the heart of a champion they both embody what we should want to do with our swimming here
1014775 i dont like these pants weve got on so much
1014776 i dont know if its too much of the gold or that theres no stripe the old gold is kind of a strong color
1014777 weve got a lot of people who are really interested in them
1014778 its just old time alum that want to know about this gold but they question it no matter what color
1014779 one of the jerseys they had you couldnt see them real well from the stands especially at some of the away games
1014780 they didnt have a small youth so shes going to use it as a pajama shirt
1014781 im brainwashing her to be a fan at an early age
1014782 if you ask me i think the pants are a little tight but thats ok
1014783 i want the dark blue jerseys from 1990 i dont like them it looks too modern
1014784 his control was so much better today weve seen him good before
1014785 an outing like this makes it seem more realistic for a guy like me who doesnt have a lot of confidence
1014786 if he can build on that and continue to build confidence hes going to be on his way
1014787 i needed to throw one more time to convince myself of what needed to be done
1014788 im going to be able to do it im going to work hard and my goal is to be back next year at some point stronger and better than i was
1014789 im kind of jealous at the timing of it to tell you the truth
1014790 in my opinion the officials here were even more deliberate than anywhere else id been
1014791 now all of a sudden you can play as fast as you want to play
1014792 we scrimmaged it all spring and we actually managed it really well now thats not at auburn or georgia with the crowd noise and all the intensity that there will be but our system allowed us to maximize the potential you can get from the clock whether its fast huddle or if you wanted to milk the clock
1014793 when i first got here we were calling out stuff at the line and going i mean well have the capability of doing it if we want but we run the ball so well out of the i set i dont see what good speeding it up will do
1014794 well no huddle some but nothing like these spread teams that will stand at the line every play theyre probably going to be able to run a few more plays but were more ball control and while the rule is going to make the game faster the rule in the sec is still to allow the defense to substitute so they can go as fast as they want but it wont be an advantage and for a ball control team like us youre going to be able to burn more clock
1014795 weve never had a problem getting plays off what i think it will do is make the game more consistent i think theyll be more consistent because you have different officials who previously wind the clock differently now as soon as the ball is down it starts
1014796 with the old clock it usually took officials about 13 or 14 seconds to spot the ball which was about 38 seconds to call a play
1014797 so in reality its about two more seconds for me the difference is theyre going to get the ball ready for play quicker theyre not going to stand over the ball theyre just going to put it down for a ball control team youre going to be able to burn more clock that way
1014798 i think teams that want to go fast are going to be able to go fast and teams that want to stand at the line of the scrimmage a lot longer can do that it might drive people nuts i dont know
1014799 i do think there is room for an 18 rated batman
1014800 its a little bit tricky to broach the sex aspect of the story when you want kids to come see it as well i mean i think it would be very interesting to do a 12 version and an 18 version two different cuts
1014801 we live in a world where you can disembowel someone in a youth hostel in romania but you cant show people having sex
1014802 i do think there is room for an 18 rated batman
1014803 no fish sauce oyster sauce or shrimp paste i cant eat them
1014804 there are these stupid barbs that make it impossible to get it back out
1014805 right dummy thats what keeps the fish on the hook
1014806 hello lady with a fishhook in her arm over here
1014807 no i am dead i am all bones and you have to dig me up
1014808 aaah right well what happened to you did a t rex get you
1014809 they were just a bunch of 420 sailors i thought i was the only sailor who got into this but we all actually got pretty close and were gonna see each other next week at buzzards
1014810 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
1014811 was that a laugh did you hear that what do you think should we say that was official
1014812 a story from infoworld is suggesting that the days of windows are numbered and that microsoft is
1014813 despite the fiscal stimulus consumers are starting to pull back under the weight of tight credit falling home values and a weakening labor market
1014814 soaring inflation notably higher food and energy prices has eaten up part of the fiscal payments
1014815 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1014816 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience
1014817 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1014818 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1014819 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
1014820 everyone understands the rules the lingo the mind set except you
1014821 it was invaluable but i didnt know it at the time
1014822 the fear there was people would think i was chinese
1014823 there would be a flood of all these asians coming in and what would we do then
1014824 if theres not any tension we probably havent done too well
1014825 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1014826 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1014827 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1014828 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1014829 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation
1014830 taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it
1014831 when i look into his eyes i can see the love of jesus christ he and i have become friends
1014832 because of the recent failed effort to obtain financing and the recognition that the companys entire 1 8 billion of debt may soon be in default
1014833 day to day operations will continue as usual while we work with our stakeholders to restructure the balance sheet
1014834 we will continue to sell build and deliver homes without interruption construction and sales activities will continue employees will come to work and be paid
1014835 we doubt this latest attempt will be successful but if it is shareholders are probably only marginally better off than if the company files for bankruptcy protection
1014836 at this point its likely that wci shares have little value aside from an option on the off chance that management is able to pull a rabbit out of a hat
1014837 severe liquidity challenges in the credit and mortgage markets diminished consumer confidence increased home inventories and foreclosures and downward pressure on home prices
1014838 clearly in our view the organization has been burning up backlog and deferred revenue to print current top line results
1014839 his batman rasps his lines in a voice thats deeper and hammier than ever
1014840 delivers his lines in a hoarse voice with an unvarying inflection
1014841 sounded absurdly deep like a 10 year old putting on an adult voice to make prank phone calls this time bale affects an eerie rasp somewhat akin to brenda vaccaro doing a
1014842 our surveys show that most women are child centered even when they dont have or want children of their own nearly every single woman we know is a devoted aunt big sister godmother or friend to the children of her relatives co workers and friends

1014844 at the time i felt like my biological clock was ticking
1014845 i was really interested in him as a father for these children because he was artistic hes a musician it seemed like it would be a nice combination of genes
1014846 kevin was taking our son a couple of mornings a week watching him in his home and i was working part time and he was really enjoying the time that he spent with his son
1014847 as they got older we set up a visitation schedule and the children would go back and forth and they sometimes spent weekends
1014848 when something like this happens in a rural community i think people are upset ordinary pennsylvanians who never expect a criminal act of this magnitude go to bed worried
1014849 theyre all dreaming and ill tell you why the markets not here its very tough down here
1014850 we see that population trending up and we think its an area thats underserved in terms of a full service grocery store which makes that an attractive area for a future lunds or byerlys
1014851 my experience is you need a population of 10 000 people per supermarket in these downtown shoppers stroll at lunchtime outside the rivertown market in st paul about 68 000 people work in downtown st paul according to 2007 data from the capital city partnership sherri larose chiglo pioneer press downtown areas to get the market share you need
1014852 we just havent seen it working really well for us
1014853 i hear all this mention of lunds coming in and yet people come in and they dont even know were here
1014854 why is it necessary for the city to always reinvent the wheel instead of investing in the successful businesses that have been here for years
1014855 location and convenience go hand in hand to capture some of those folks leaving downtown to go home
1014856 that northeast store has been extremely successful above even our projections for that store
1014857 youre doing mass numbers but you dont have the mother of four with a shopping cart filled to the brim
1014858 a lot of them are saying were going to wait and see with gas prices were going to see how the election shakes out

1014878 he is deluded the one who says that the iraqi people have departed from islam and do not want islam and that this will be replaced by secularism and the like this is a living evidence and example taking into consideration that millions of people have visited al kazimiyah under these difficult circumstances
1014879 role of the security forces and the continuous achievements and successes they make beginning with basra mosul and maysan and ending with diyala
1014880 however the arrows of accusations were aimed at the government which according to sayyid al hasani stands idly watching the financial and administrative corruption that has ruined most of the ministries
1014881 for his part sayyid yasin al musawi imam and preacher of the friday sermon in holy al najaf stressed the importance of the security operation in the diyala governorate saying that it is aimed at achieving security and enforcing the sovereignty of law

1014943 this momentum will carry us into the first quarter of 2009 and even beyond
1014944 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand
1014945 perhaps consumers all over the world will think china is all low end but we want to be the high end
1014946 to change that view is very difficult but we have no choice
1014947 we want to do the europe market last year and this year
1014948 next year will be the united states step by step
1014949 we are pleased that gowher rizvi has accepted our invitation to direct the universitys international programs
1014950 he has significant experience and a strong record of success in both academic and non academic undertakings we look forward to supporting mr rizvi as he cooperates with the provost and our school deans to develop a comprehensive plan for enhancing the universitys global impact and implementing that plan
1014951 my goal is to position the university of virginia in a worldwide leadership role in a variety of fields of knowledge
1014952 toward that end we must contribute to the development of intellectual capital in an international context by enhancing the educational research and public service opportunities for students faculty and staff
1014953 will involve both taking u va to the world and bringing the world to the grounds so that our graduates are equally at home both here and abroad in global multicultural settings
1014954 so as to facilitate for our faculty and students a genuine global experience and to remain at the cutting edge of research
1014955 gowher rizvi brings ideal experience to u va being a rhodes scholar himself having lived in a number of countries and directed the ford foundation in asia he has become known at the kennedy school at harvard for his ability to draw faculty together a talent that will surely fit well here
1014956 our goal is for them to win outside grants worth five to 10 times as much
1014957 the more that people bring together their diverse backgrounds and expertise the better the research will be at least thats our belief
1014958 these seed money awards show the willingness of u va s various schools to join together to address pressing issues of energy and the environment
1014959 through collaboration these proposals are positioned for further support from a wider range of sources and also greater potential to solve our very real environmental challenges
1014960 the significant number of outstanding proposals received for this multidisciplinary seed funding is indicative of the strong faculty and student commitment to both addressing this critical area of global need and coalescing around multidimensional problems
1014961 this is one more step in cooperation between the city and the university
1014962 nothing is more important than the safety and security of our students whether they live on grounds or off grounds
1014963 the university funded city housing inspector is an example of the university and the city of charlottesville achieving something together that neither of us could do alone its a model that has been gaining national attention from universities and local governments who seek ways to collaborate for the greater safety of their students
1014964 now we are able to concentrate on the neighborhood and do inspections proactively
1014965 city residents have voiced gratitude for corys promptness in following up on concerns about property maintenance and safety issues
1014966 i was teaching the landlord what to do to keep the property up
1014967 or teaching students that they had to pick up their trash in order to be responsible citizens
1014968 he was doing a great job and he was active and dependable
1014969 he had bright ideas including helping with a new computer system and changing how files were recorded and updated
1014970 the property maintenance inspector position however does not require extensive construction knowledge as much as it requires good people skills and problem solving skills and an understanding of the customers we encounter
1014971 with regard to those skills mr fabio seems to be a very good fit for this position
1014972 the inspectors conduct annual inspections of fraternity and sorority houses which involve at least two visits each year
1014973 when i was a renter i would have laughed if i had gotten one of my letters telling me to cut the grass or pick up the trash
1014974 you see the importance of it when you do it day to day
1014975 a change in the computer system that was not properly tested
1014976 we are still going through the situation and assessing it right now
1014977 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day demand met rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard to find organic brew black forest berry honest tea and worry about the price of arugula
1014978 you go to my home you fall on my stairs and then you sue me i am responsible
1014979 we went to see him at the hospital and his bed was empty
1014980 we have had to use a high pressure hose several times now but not the all the paint has come off
1014981 unfortunately nothing came of that and things have continued to happen again and again
1014982 i heard a couple girls screaming so i didnt get up cause it was dark
1014983 then i heard a speed boat pulling out going really fast
1014984 i saw one person who walked off the boat and everybody else was taken off by stretcher from there
1014985 i think its horrible how anybody could do that and take off
1014986 we need barrels and people to be aware that they need to slow down
1014987 we think of this as just another tool at the gym
1014988 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1014989 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1014990 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow
1014991 you could barely walk along the sand because there were so many jellyfish
1014992 we didnt get these years ago but now were getting the frequency of them a lot more
1014993 and they can be big weve had some that were just tremendous that weve had to come and pick them off the beach because of the danger
1014994 jellyfish are really just a symptom of oceans in crisis
1014995 there were more than 20 million jellyfish in that lagoon right in front of the vacation homes which is good for learning more about them but not so good if you own one of those homes
1014996 because of my ethnicity we have discoloration sometimes because i love the sun so i do get different pigmentation
1014997 the first time i went and i was like wow what an improvement i mean drastically
1014998 patients with poor skin textures patients with pigment abnormalities patients with fine lesions bumps and lumps on the skin
1014999 so that opens the pores and then cleanses the pores all kind of the same motion
1015000 the nice thing about the system is that theres really no down time

1015010 gas prices are soaring and kentuckys gas tax just went up again
1015011 nearly 30 years ago bruce lunsford lobbied for automatic gas tax increases
1015012 we changed the way we tax gas in this state to give us a budget that could grow
1015013 all the other states are getting killed right now because less gas is being sold and their prices are set at cents per gallon
1015014 for kentucky the tax went up because the price went up so the government isnt in as bad a shape
1015015 an insult to the people who have kept him in office for 24 years

1015017 solzhenitsyns death reminds us of what writers are supposed to do which is to speak out in their own voices even if those voices arent comfortable to hear
1015018 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
1015019 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
1015020 in the midst of exhausting prison camp relocations marching in a column of prisoners in the gloom of bitterly cold evenings with strings of camp lights glimmering through the darkness we would often feel rising in our breast what we would have wanted to shout out to the whole world if only the whole world could have heard us
1015021 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie
1015022 in terms of the effect he has had on history solzhenitsyn is the dominant writer of the 20th century who else compares orwell koestler and yet when his name comes up now it is more often than not as a freak a monarchist an anti semite a crank a has been
1015023 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
1015024 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
1015025 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on
1015026 and then joseph said but you know susan everything solzhenitsyn says about the soviet union is true
1015027 shukov felt pleased with his life as he went to sleep
1015028 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
1015029 just one of the 3 653 days of his sentence from bell to bell the extra three days were for leap years
1015030 you have described only one day and yet everything there is to say about prison has been said
1015031 theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil
1015032 it is impossible to go on writing as one did before
1015033 a man with a unique life story whose name will endure throughout the history of russia
1015034 severe trials befell solzhenitsyn as they did millions of other people in this country
1015035 he was among the first to speak out about the brutality of stalins regime and about the people who experienced it but were not crushed
1015036 changed the minds of millions of people making them rethink their past and present
1015037 probably i would not have survived eight years of the camps if as a mathematician i had not been assigned for three years to a sharashka
1015038 i was like the sick people all around me and yet i was different
1015039 i had fewer rights than they had and was forced to be more silent people came to visit them and their one concern their one aim in life was to get well again but if i recovered it would be almost pointless i was 35 years of age and yet in that spring i had no one i could call my own in the whole world i did not even own a passport and if i were to recover i should have to leave this green abundant land and go back to my desert where i had been exiled in perpetuity there i was under open surveillance reported on every fortnight and for a long time the local police had not even allowed me a dying man to go away for treatment
1015040 demand and ensure the abolition of all censorship open or hidden
1015041 no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death
1015042 courageous creative work upholding the sense of human dignity and exposing the trampling of the human soul and the destruction of human values
1015043 she simply joined me in my struggle and we went side by side
1015044 in a strange way i not only hope i am inwardly convinced that i shall go back
1015045 i live with that conviction i mean my physical return not just my books and that contradicts all rationality
1015046 he wrote ate and slept and that was about all
1015047 for him to accept a telephone call was an event he rarely left his 50 acres
1015048 instead of secluding myself here and writing the red wheel i suppose i could have spent time making myself likable to the west
1015049 the only problem is that i would have had to drop my way of life and my work
1015050 his own convictions are deeply rooted in the russian spirit which is untempered by the civilizing influences of a democratic tradition
1015051 like the russian masses he we may assume has strong authoritarian tendencies
1015052 leading intellectuals here consider his oratory hollow his time past and his mission unclear
1015053 in fact is not anti semitic his books are not anti semitic and he is not in his personal relations anti jewish natalias mother is jewish and not a few of his friends are too
1015054 is not worth a brass farthing if it is installed by bayonet
1015055 inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration
1015056 you know this controversy folks just will not go away this controversy about obama and the prayer at the western wall
1015057 wobei paranoia praktisch jeder weiss wie der ami schon so oft gegen eher linksgerichtete regierungen in s damerika vorgegangen ist

1015059 ich kann ihn verstehen w re ich auch schon einmal vom cia gest rzt worden damit man eine pseudodemokratie einsetzt die von l monarchen regiert wird und das volk verhungern l sst wie vor chavez

1015086 stay strong and not be nervous this is your day and even i came to make sure my bestie is happy
1015087 at the end of string street where it dead ends into furnace avenue there was a great swimming hole the hole was formed by water running out of a large culvert that went under part of the old furnace yards it ran from the point near the end of strang street to a point near the railroad trestle where coal bank hollow begins it was used to drain the water out of the hollow this is the beginning of black creek
1015088 where the water ran off the end of the cement that formed the culvert it had washed out a pretty good sized hole in the ground i can remember spending many enjoyable times in the swimming hole and making trips through the culvert
1015089 you have to remember how poor everyone was back then none of us could afford a flashlight and it was so dark in that place that you could stick out your finger and when you pulled your finger back it would leave a hole in the dark anyway the only way to make it through the place without falling into one of the many big holes along the floor was to keep your back against the wall and feel your way along by sliding your foot along out in front of you feeling for the holes when the guy leading the way would find one of the holes he would pass the word back to ones behind him each one had to feel to see how wide the hole was so he could step across they were full of water and no one knew just how deep they were
1015090 there is no telling what lived in that place i would not want to go through it today with a floodlight and a gun however at the time we did it a lot and did not think too much about it
1015091 i remember one time a bunch of us were nearing the end of the culvert and someone touched the neck of the guy in front of him and screamed bats
1015092 help i think i can still feel the bats teeth all over me thinking back on it today i can laugh about it but there was not anything funny about it at the time i think i still have some battle scars from the mad mauling we all took that day i still get an awful desire to look over my shoulder when i come out into the light from some dark place just another summer day in good old rockwood

1015434 you dont have to wait until the olympics start to get a good view of what a perfect racing forward stroke looks like take a peek at this video especially the slow motion stuff at the end even if you are not racing and dont have a wing paddle there is a lot to be learned from this notice as you watch the level punch the top arm does not dip down at the end of the stroke and is always parallel to the water the knees pumping with the huge cockpit you can see how much the legs need to be involved very important even if you are just cruising the torso rotation at the end of the video there is a slo mo sequence of a racer he has a vertical stripe down the middle of his shirt perfect for showing what the torso is really doing the crossover of the top arm giving great torso rotation this is really obvious at the end of the video in the same shot as mentioned above the height of the seat the paddlers butts are moving a little in the seat proving that a too tight backrest or backband is not good for power paddling the fact that at the end of the stroke the blade is quite far away from the hull at 2 53 in the video look at where the paddle is in relation to the hull its pretty far out now look at the wake coming off the boat hes got the blade right in this wave giving him an extra boost

1015501 his experimental genius stood with the very best of his times his industry his daring his imagination and his inventive hypotheses should have made him in the eyes of historians darwins rival yet his own success as a popularizer ironically did as much to cast his extraordinary science into the shadows as did the negligent attitude of subsequent scholars

1015535 government is using the terrorist threat as an excuse to strengthen its power
1015536 with the use of modern technology the control is tighter than china ever had before this is an exercise of state power peoples rights are heavily violated is this an olympics or some kind of warfare
1015537 has distanced himself from the state and the olympics refusing to attend the opening ceremony which will take place on friday and becoming an increasingly outspoken advocate of political reform he feels china is spoiling the atmosphere of the games with an overzealous security operation according to domestic media the authorities have mobilized 100 000 police installed 300 000 surveillance cameras and sited anti aircraft missiles next to the stadium there are three rings of checkpoints on roads into the city and i d inspections have been stepped up
1015538 i think it is a shame its a loss the original idea was to invite the international community to china to share the same values celebrate humanity and goodwill to speak about peace and social harmony but today you see police everywhere in every neighborhood there is tight security not just in beijing but everywhere in china people really live in a police state
1015539 refused to apologize over the internet access row which he admitted has been the hot topic heading into the beijing games rogge speaking after the iocs pre games executive board meeting insisted no deal had been struck with the chinese organizers to accept some website restrictions he also pointed out that internet access had improved since the beginning of last week when several politically sensitive websites were blocked
1015540 i am not going to apologize for something for which the ioc is not responsible we are not running the internet in china the ioc is in favor of the broadest amount of internet access for the media that is the bottom line secondly there has been no deal at any time between the ioc leadership and the games organizers to accept any restrictions
1015541 that senior ioc members had struck a deal with chinese authorities which he had only just become aware of
1015542 the deal may well have been done by the executive board done in another place by very senior people in the ioc im very disappointed not to have been informed
1015543 the ioc would like to stress that no deal with the chinese authorities to censor the internet has ever in any way been entered into
1015544 the restrictions on internet usage that have been imposed in china arent they against the olympic charter
1015545 not at all the agreement we made with the chinese organizers gives journalists the possibility of freely doing reports about the games the chinese have even gone further in allowing them to do reports about general subjects too but they have always expressed a reservation about what constitutes a danger to national security they have a right to do so
1015546 china has chosen not to recognize international norms for press freedom now it is the rest of the world that may suffer along with the international olympic committee whose optics have been severely tarnished last wednesday the ioc announced that its previous guarantees of internet freedom for visiting journalists during the 2008 summer olympics in beijing will be unmet though friday china agreed to lift some restrictions this means that journalists covering the games will likely be subjected to the strictures of a massive electronic surveillance network nicknamed the great firewall which among other things blocks internet access to information the chinese government finds objectionable it was naive of the ioc to expect china to honor its vows to protect press freedoms chinas promises of respect for human rights have been ignored almost since they were uttered by some estimates tens of thousands of impoverished people have been evicted from their homes to make way for olympic infrastructure visa restrictions have been tightened and official harassment of foreigners and minorities has increased in recent weeks domestic critics have not been spared either scores of dissidents and petitioners with unrelated grievances have been detained or placed in forced labor camps even the urban poor have been targeted many have been swept off the streets as part of beijings image makeover perhaps now the ioc has learned that awarding games to totalitarian regimes is not good for the olympic movement the governing olympic body should have learned that lesson when it awarded the 1980 summer games to moscow which ended up being boycotted by much of the free world after the soviet union invaded afghanistan besides destroying the dreams of thousands of athletes who sacrificed so much to make it to an olympics that boycott very nearly destroyed the olympics altogether
1015547 when the games get under way there will be countless opportunities for the global leaders present to make courteously clear to their hosts their disquiet about chinas foreign policy failures concerning sudan and burma about the repression in tibet about the plight of chinese christians and other minorities and the treatment of human rights activists they need look no further than the report last week on chinas record every european head of government present should express concern about the conviction last year for inciting subversion of a human rights activist hu jia after he had told a european union parliamentary hearing that china had not lived up to the promises it had made to the olympic authorities on human rights

1015587 there are many ways to get to know buenos aires but there are only a few doors into its heart the caf s bars and restaurants of the city grant easy entr e to its true spirit
1015588 its not my favorite i dont like their dough but you should probably try it
1015589 the gnocchi at don lech n are really good and so are the lentils
1015590 but the lech n is excelente its not that easy to find good lech n in buenos aires
1015591 theres no other city in the world with an ethnic mosaic like ours
1015592 we had two huge waves of immigration one in 1880 the other in 1910 in 1880 there were 400 000 people living in buenos aires then 2 5 million people immigrated to the city that year can you imagine
1015593 you had races mixing like they had nowhere else arabs and israelis greeks and armenians spanish and italians so there was a real lack of nationalism people cared more about their home countries than about argentina they were always looking outside
1015594 all that mixing of the races created beautiful women we have the most beautiful women in the world here and the best ice cream
1015595 do you know what youre going to eat you ordered lech n right
1015596 but people dont know whether it has mascarpone or not the important thing is that they like it
1015597 you must be kidding me this country really needs a new president this country is so messed up
1015598 its such a joke and its quite upsetting frankly how hypocritical this country has become
1015599 preparing for this major event required us to make very careful equipment vendor and solution choices
1015600 selecting tandberg television for this project was easy their rock solid contribution and distribution products and the expertise of their team members allow us to continually raise the bar and provide our viewers with exceptional picture quality
1015601 nbc will offer the most in depth olympic coverage in history and we are honored to support them as they embark on this unprecedented project
1015602 we look forward to working with nbc to deliver an outstanding broadcast of the beijing olympic games to millions of viewers across the us
1015603 ive been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad i actually have three responses
1015604 it is a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1015605 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1015606 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1015607 shiloh calls them her babies she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mommies
1015608 this is mads fourth fifth time becoming an older bro hes asking us when we can have more
1015609 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1015610 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1015611 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality and knox a bit of me
1015612 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1015613 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
1015614 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
1015615 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1015616 will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
1015617 why should i bother to plant flowers i might as well be in a campground
1015618 when it pulls up i literally feel the joy draining out of my body
1015619 it was very important to us that this celebration honor the past while looking to the future of the brand and integrate several key elements and we feel that we have achieved what we set out to do
1015620 with the support of our many partner companies and licensees this event will be the most memorable event we have held in our history

1015633 we became aware of the necessity of an electronic password to post our filing
1015634 im very thrilled and excited to have been given the opportunity to captain england
1015635 its a huge honour and a terrific challenge for me at this stage of my international career
1015636 i have learned a great deal about leadership from playing under both michael and paul and fully appreciate the level of responsibility that comes with the job of captaining your country
1015637 they are big shoes that i have to fill but i will give it the best possible go it is a great honour
1015638 it is something that has turned my life around in the last 24 hours it has been a very emotional time for me
1015639 time will tell but i hope it wont restrict the way i play ive been successful with my style and i would be foolish to change that
1015640 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain
1015641 kevin is a world class player who will command the respect of the dressing room and i am sure he will be looking to lead from the front and work closely with both the players and the coaching staff to bring england success in the future

1015643 we are still investigating the fire but we believe it was lightning from the heavy storm this morning
1015644 before whitehead the idea that any part of the telecommunications market could be open to competition was radical
1015645 in television you had three networks in telephone you had ma bell and nobody else
1015646 all the stuff that has come since cable television and cellphones and broadband springs from the idea that tom whitehead introduced that a competitive market would bring innovation and diversity
1015647 you cant say that everything thats happened since 1974 is attributable to one guy i guess but if you could it would be tom he was very very important
1015648 extending a tv signal beyond its ordinary broadcast range in those days required using long chains of microwave repeaters one every 30 miles or so
1015649 for the next three and a half years whitehead fought ceaselessly for open skies
1015650 the open skies policy whitehead wanted finally became law in 1974
1015651 its not exactly correct to say that whiteheads struggle against the telecommunications monopolies has been largely forgotten
1015652 time will tell i hope it wont its a way ive been successful with so far in my career and something i want to try and keep at a real high level
1015653 the way i play is very gut instinct orientated and i like to do things spontaneously i like to do what i feel is right in a situation
1015654 i think over the years ive played cricket ive gained a good cricket brain my gut instinct when ive been batting for england has assisted me tremendously its a brand new challenge for me and i love challenges
1015655 huge boots to try and fill michael was a great leader and a great friend
1015656 you could see how emotional michael was when he spoke about his family and its an emotional decision
1015657 he likes to challenge us on a daily basis there are a lot of strong characters in the dressing room and a lot of opinionated people i sat down with peter and we had a real good discussion about how we want to take this team forward i think my position from a player to a captain is totally different and we need to unite and to get on the same hymn sheet
1015658 i will always respect what happened in the past and i will always ask for advice im fresh into this and i will need some help one of the most exciting things is that i have had text messages and phone calls from senior members in the squad who have said they are right behind me
1015659 i havent even thought that far ahead my concern this week is about how we can salvage pride from this series
1015660 hopefully i am going to bat exactly the same way the way colly paul collingwood and i played is exactly the way you need to play against south africa and against australia you have to be positive and aggressive

1015676 we believe that the partnerships that we have with communities community based organisations and development partners will take us close to this target if not there
1015677 everyone is on board with a specific attention in this term to the elderly people and people with disabilities
1015678 these challenges are difficult to deal with and many people remain vulnerable to diseases such as hiv and aids in south africa the high number of people estimated to be living with hiv in our country implies that many people are and will be in need of treatment for a long time
1015679 as we struggle with climate change food prices fuel shortages and underdevelopment hiv and aids continues to loom large on the radar screen
1015680 nepad the african position on universal access to universal access to hiv and aids prevention treatment care and support as well as the southern africa development community sadc hiv and aids strategy provide a framework for a regional approach to this disease
1015681 let us seek to find convincingly effective hiv prevention interventions relevant to each specific epidemic in countries as well as hiv vaccines that work

1015686 die anderen sprinter schauen nur auf die zeit meinen wohl der ist nicht gut genug es geht doch darum dass man im kr ftemessen gegeneinander den besten ermittelt
1015687 es geht um den wettkampf und der sieg darf nicht hinter den rekord treten der rekord ist letztlich ein abfallprodukt des sieges und nicht der sinn des wettkampfes wir m ssen die uhr nicht abschaffen aber eine besinnung auf das duell w re sinnvoll
1015688 er denkt in diesem punkt anders als ich es ist vielleicht die einzige meinungsverschiedenheit die wir haben
1015689 wir m ssen st rker zum wettkampfdenken zur ckkommen und aufh ren mit der jagd auf absolute rekorde wer einen wettkampf gewonnen aber den rekord verfehlt hat wird da schnell zum versager gestempelt
1015690 wenn du eine halbe stunde brauchst um die 100 meter zu gewinnen ist es halt so und du bist trotzdem der sieger

1015694 castle and rodgers have lived the high life for many years living off the proceeds of crime
1015695 this has been a complex and protracted inquiry which has been exacerbated by the fact that the crimes have been committed all over the uk
1015696 what appeared at the outset to be an investigation into shoplifting culminated in much more serious charges being brought
1015697 she was spending on a massive scale at places such as harrods and claridges in london
1015698 i can still taste it your innocence promise me youll never lose it
1015699 oi kame moshi moshi i can see the lights but home
1015700 well more like an old friend the rest of us talked to her earlier but you werent there
1015701 ill be waiting for you in the cafeteria you promised to be cinderella to help me practise remember
1015702 i just dropped by today to see how you were all doing with rehearsals
1015703 i dont mean like being a virgin i mean your heart youve fallen in love and i have a pretty good idea who with
1015704 a believe a certain gaki san has caught your heart am i wrong
1015705 well im not going to keep you from your crush any longer just tell her how you feel im sure she feels the same i can tell
1015706 i never got to thank you for helping me break out of my shell so im going to thank you now
1015707 i want to melt down their phones i want to flood their e mail boxes i want to hold them as political hostages the ransom demand is to unleash the free market to begin exploring and pumping domestic crude oil and getting it to market as fast as possible weve got 75 days to make our voices heard lets make history by bringing this recalcitrant body of elitists into compliance with the will of the people and the rule of law
1015708 if we let these rascals these scoundrels leave town before they lift all their ridiculous bans and restrictions on drilling for domestic oil this country is headed for a major recession even worse well head into a new year and a new presidency with the washington elite thinking they put one over on us again
1015709 this will give time for shahrizat to prepare to take over and stop any bickering and jostling over power
1015710 but if there is a contest i will not defend my post
1015711 this pact will ensure that the movement will remain strong and stable and continues to be a source of strength as the partys backbone
1015712 of course we have those two choices but we want to protect the strength of the party and we need to avoid any division that can cause negative effects to the party so i believe the transition plans are moves which are incumbent and shows wise leadership which ensures our strength is maintained
1015713 i dont want a contest as i want to keep the party and wanita united and have a smooth transition
1015714 if anyone wants to contest i wont stand you can have a free for all amongst yourself and i dont want to be involved
1015715 when i visited her about two weeks ago when she wasnt feeling well she also spoke about this but this is not something for me todecide
1015716 the decision has to be based on the grassroots and so i have kept my ears close to the ground
1015717 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1015718 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
1015719 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials

1015722 earlier the proposal was for a concession to build and manage the bridge now it is going to be done as a contract
1015723 so thats why they set up the spv which will be like a concession holder and whoever builds the bridge will do it as a contract
1015724 im not smart enough or good enough or i cant
1015725 to get what you have never had you have to do what you have never done
1015726 you see it was the only workers i could get
1015727 its a fine mess weve gotten ourselves into now isnt it
1015728 this is going to make it extraordinarily difficult for whoevers going to become president i dont care who the president is
1015729 the government has known for decades that america is on a countdown to self destruction
1015730 the object of the research was the development of a plausible vision of the future in which democratic methods survive major problems are managed successfully if not resolved and the unfolding of the human potential continues to expand
1015731 those who should get in get in those who should be kept out are kept out and those who should not be here will be required to leave
1015732 the thing about this research is that this work has confirmed that our economy based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood is destroying the social fabric of america
1015733 this system is based on a stacked deck where the top elites always reap the profits that are made to rise to the top through the corporate profits based system
1015734 the research confirmed that the rowing inequities of such a system were ever increasing and with them elevated social tensions
1015735 despite all the reports shortcomings and its hypocrisy it does make some sound observations about what is needed for our immediate survival we should take it as a guide to what our government knows about the coming mega crisis and a template to help us see what changes we could make if there were truly a new economy a new social contract a new american state for it is obvious to all those who take the time to look that we are headed into a period of national freefall when american society plunges head first into a dark abyss of uncertainty as the old order passes away and the new world order rushes in to fill the void we are seeing the planned collapse of america coming down the road we are on what are we going to do to get our nation off that highway to hell
1015736 i think the main change is that 4e is not a

1015739 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1015740 parents want to feed their children healthy meals but americas chain restaurants are setting parents up to fail
1015741 mcdonalds burger king kfc and other chains are conditioning kids to expect burgers fried chicken pizza french fries macaroni and cheese and soda in various combination at almost every lunch and dinner
1015742 more detailed nutritional information and choice in menu options for consumers
1015743 fails to acknowledge the essential role of nutrition education physical activity and parental responsibility in childhood nutrition good eating habits and healthy living must be established in the home
1015744 proud to offer a variety of kids meals for those looking for lower calorie lower fat options
1015745 that i may publish with the voice of thanksgiving and tell of all thy wondrous works
1015746 i placed my house on the market in march for 210 000 but in three months i didnt get a single viewing in may i dropped the price to 180 000 but still didnt have any luck i placed it on the market with housenetworks lettings division and soon had a six month tenancy agreement with a lovely young family giving me a rental income of 750 per month which covered my mortgage
1015747 the greatest thing in all my life is loving you
1015748 too stubborn to quit and too stupid to know when ive been beat
1015749 at first i was confident i could get nominations from at least 60 divisions now i doubt i can even get 40
1015750 mukhriz may have overplayed his hand he was right to tap into the anti pak lah sentiment but there is also fatigue in the party people want to move on and the general view is that the transition plan helps us to move on and concentrate on fighting the opposition
1015751 this is a very pragmatic party once a decision is taken the majority will move in the same direction anyone who fights the majority decision will be isolated
1015752 anything price is possible it depends on how much you want to set aside for subsidies already the subsidy bill is huge
1015753 we can give you the figures it is already very very big subsidy amount and the worldwide trend is actually moving more and more towards world market price
1015754 one implication is that the subsidy bill will be simply enormous for the country secondly you are moving against the world trend thirdly you will encourage greater consumption and less conservation
1015755 a lot of wastage will occur because people are going to use energy at prices well below the market price you are not educating the public that energy is actually expensive and it is finite it is not unlimited it cannot go on forever and ever
1015756 its balls out unapologetic femme fatale punk rock and roll which is the music we love
1015757 bn is a racist group bn uses racism to cover corruption
1015758 if umno does not change the chinese and indians will not vote for bn the mca mic and gerakan will have to close shop
1015759 the mca must tell umno to take a more multiracial approach
1015760 we must all consider ourselves first as malaysians and govern on the basis of upholding democracy and justice
1015761 the mca is still a chinese party but it should become issues based and have a multiracial outlook these issues include corruption abuse of power and hindraf they are all our issues
1015762 but we have to remain careful now though because the malays feel threatened
1015763 we are only now growing up as a country i would say we are at a stage where we are no longer children but still not quite an adult yet
1015764 instead we put the hardware and software at the telecom companies where we can more effectively monitor all communications not just the communications from the hotels then despite being against the law we grant the telecoms retroactive immunity

1015766 en italia la criminalidad es un problema muy grave y la culpa es de los inmigrantes de los extranjeros
1015767 el gobierno italiano est actuando muy bien en un grupo de diez extranjeros hay ocho que no trabajan y se dedican a actividades criminales y lo digo yo que llegu aqu en 1984 sin papeles
1015768 yo tengo una actividad y trabajo con italianos y extranjeros pero los extranjeros sin permiso no pueden estar aqu es un problema para todos nosotros los italianos y todo el pa s

1015825 without an additional government policy jolt the economy is headed for a very slow second half of 2008
1015826 either the third or fourth quarters should register negative gdp growth
1015827 but in a way taxistas are the new gauchos their cabs are their horses and their passengers are the cattle and theyve chosen their profession because they want to be free above all else
1015828 youre writing about argentina you want to write about argentina mir if you tell people the truth about this place no one will believe you

1015835 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1015836 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1015837 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it
1015838 a complete waste of the money john mccains contributors have donated to his campaign
1015839 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
1015840 i like to eat well this is a really stressful job mentally although its very sedentary physically thats why the majority of taxistas have heart problems or high blood pressure they eat badly
1015841 my average shift is about 13 hours so i really try to watch what i eat
1015842 there will be no dialog until the roadblocks are lifted
1015843 look i dont know how much you know about whats going on here but back when alfons n was president he gave in to the demands of striking workers this set up a destructive pattern ever since people have used striking as a way to twist the arm of politicians in this country and cristina isnt going to make the same mistake
1015844 the farmers production costs are low so the export taxes are justified
1015845 our entire economy is based on a system of retenciones and subsidies without them the country would collapse

1015850 the inflation that we are experiencing is a one off impact
1015851 this one off inflation is just for a few months after that it should moderate we dont see inflation at a very high level beyond august

1015865 podemos decir que nadie naci sabiendo pero si has manejado office sabes manejar openoffice al 80 con lo que no es necesario proprcionar un alto nivel de soporte tecnico excepto para su instalacion o actualizacion
1015866 desconozco la version que ha probado la administracion pero mi version de openoffice cumple las mismas necesidades y alguna mas que una herramienta propietaria como por ejemplo cumplir con todos los estandares libres e incluso los propietarios en cuanto al cliente de correo evolution por ejemplo es una muy buena herramienta de correo que cumple pefectamente y si se trata de migrar a software libre tambien es posible migrar el servidor de correo ya que existen alternativas potentes con un gran tiempo de desarrollo detras
1015867 creo que deberian consultar a determinadas empresas del software libre y sino podemos invitar a richard stallman acudiria encantado para que les muestre una docena de alternativas
1015868 quizas sea mejor confiar en los se ores de microsoft y la contrastada seguridad y fiabilidad de su software
1015869 sinceramente creo que aqui la culpa es ambas partes del fabricante de hardware y del comprador por no preocuparse de conocer lo que compra desde luego no es de quien te proporciona medios para un uso libre del software aun asi cada vez mas los fabricantes de hardware proporcionan soporte y controladores para linux
1015870 hay miedo y pocas ganas de pensar en soluciones tambien existe mucho desconocimiento acerca de la repercusion que la enunciacion de una plataforma libre para administraciones publicas puede tener no se considera algo necesario y deberia tornarse en algo exigible por los ciudadanos que pagamos el soporte tecnico y el pago de licencias
1015871 this wonderful virtual event gave children real world context by allowing them to plant trees and rehabilitate a forest and then see the impact including reduced air pollution and providing a habitat for wildlife
1015872 the ability to see the online impact of their tree planting and knowing it will translate into an offline one provides children with a sense of empowerment and a purposeful experience
1015873 dizzywoods tree planting is a great example of how an adventurous storyline can cleverly weave a strong educational component into play
1015874 it is an opportunity to allow kids to see the wider impact that they can have by working together as well as what it means to be a citizen of the world in this case a virtual one we hope the kids are as inspired to see their online environmental activity have real world results as we are

1015905 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1015906 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1015907 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1015908 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1015909 we have seen that when there are recessions and when there are costs pressures that come in the companies still want to cut costs
1015910 to capture this opportunity first and foremost we need people we need people who will do these services we need people at entry level and we need people at middle management level
1015911 today i dare say our education system is focused on creating educated unemployable people we have to fundamentally revamp that to create the education system to cater to not only the domestic but to the international demand

1015925 there are significant waiting times for many procedures many norwegians often go abroad for medical treatments the average weight for a hip replacement is more than 4 months approximately 23 percent of all patients referred for hospital admission have to wait longer than three months for admission also care can be denied if it is not deemed to be cost effective

1015927 there are significant waiting times for many procedures many norwegians often go abroad for medical treatments the average weight for a hip replacement is more than 4 months approximately 23 percent of all patients referred for hospital admission have to wait longer than three months for admission also care can be denied if it is not deemed to be cost effective

1015938 thats the fate of politicians everywhere up and down whats important is what you finally do before you leave
1015939 we want to show how unhappy the malaysian public are with the oil price rise
1015940 the government has forced us to the streets to demand a reversal of this disastrous policy this is more than a wake up call for the pm
1015941 we want the pm to resign after this unacceptable rise
1015942 we must support the peoples rights to demand more help from the government because we are suffering from this price rise
1015943 i think there will be more protests because we definitely dont want to pay so much more how do i feed my children she asked
1015944 theres a strong possibility and the discussion is still ongoing not only with mca but also with umno and other components of barisan national
1015945 weve had a series of meetings with umno lawmakers theres no way we will form any coalition with umno as a party but we are more than happy to welcome any umno mps who are willing to support the cause
1015946 its going to be very soon but certainly we need some time
1015947 all 15 mca mps have contacted me to deny ever meeting anwar let alone jump ship
1015948 so you have to appreciate their predicament but our discussions with the component parties are very positive and progressing very well
1015949 i have no power now if they want to investigate okay fine i can face it
1015950 they can investigate me i want to know the truth
1015951 i remember addressing the asean law conference in 1995 as deputy prime minister but i cant recall attending any conference involving judges
1015952 there will be no more fuel price hikes for this year
1015953 the court should recall balasubramaniam bring the man here as i want to question him on the status of his evidence the judge should at least have done that
1015954 the parent expected all this when i asked him parent if he was coming or not he said he doesnt see light at the end of the tunnel so whats the point of him coming
1015955 a weak leader who had no stand of his own
1015956 im not saying im supporting tan sri muhyiddin i can support anyone as im no longer an umno member
1015957 if he wins he should be appointed deputy prime minister during tun musa hitams time he did not want the deputy presidents post so i appointed tun ghafar baba as the deputy prime minister
1015958 but tun ghafar had to contest for the deputy presidents post and he won defeating tun musa
1015959 other people should be allowed to contest so that the desire to institute changes in the party will be achieved but i believe the election will be manipulated they will choose people supported by datuk seri abdullah
1015960 then najib may win and he will be the deputy prime minister and the prime minister designate
1015961 continued insensitive attitude of the government towards serious issues in sabah
1015962 it is a decision reached by consensus after hearing all the views in the supreme council meeting majority of the supreme council members supported the motion of no confidence against the prime minister
1015963 the two sapp mps will support any vote of no confidence against the prime minister in parliament or one of them will move the motion
1015964 the action by the aca on me is to deter others from taking the same stand as us aca is creating a situation of fear
1015965 why investigate now when sapp is moving a no confidence motion
1015966 i cannot afford to be distracted by issues that keep coming up i have to be focused with what i have to do when things like this happen we have to deal with it
1015967 whether we vote for no confidence or not i think the people have lost confidence in the cabinet i think its time for change
1015968 one of the main reasons we are cycling is to let the rakyat people know that we know their hardship and we are with them
1015969 if theres a vote and they make themselves present and they vote against us we will take action against them
1015970 i am very sure because we have 140 even if the two of them jumped theres only 84 dont try to bring down this government by undemocratic means wait for the next election
1015971 it is worrying because it is a business index which reflects on our domestic investment foreign direct investment and confidence in the economy
1015972 our economic structure the way we do business here needs to be reviewed renewed and redesigned
1015973 malaysia can do much better if there is stronger political will to fight corruption given the rapid pace of globalisation and increasing economic competition among asian countries its time to pull our socks up
1015974 i admit i was wrong in choosing abdullah as my successor now i regret because i didnt think that mr clean would not be that clean
1015975 i believe that umno members and leaders at all levels who are angry with me for anointing abdullah surely does not want to make the same mistake
1015976 following this the umno general assembly officiated my choice of abdullah as deputy party president during the party elections
1015977 thus i assumed that the succession plan to abdullah was not something that was not wanted by umno no one objected
1015978 no one pleaded for him to stay on it is clear that everyone wanted him to step down
1015979 mca leaders are leaving the party gerakan is being left behind and the mic will be left with only datuk seri s samy vellu at the rate members are leaving the party
1015980 i have done nothing wrong and i have not used the post for my own political ends
1015981 of course i am concerned over the allegation by malaysia today blogger raja petra kamarudin what raja petra did is unacceptable because what he stated is incorrect
1015982 the attorney general has told me that an investigation will be carried out and action will be taken against him
1015983 no i cant remember receiving anything he can say anything but i have not seen it
1015984 as a responsible citizen i will say again that i have never known or even met this woman before i pray that the court will continue to seek justice and uphold the law without any interference
1015985 i have not been able to satisfy his personal greed
1015986 i have not received anything yet no notice has been submitted to my office so far
1015987 whether it is going to be accepted or not i would have to look at it first before making a decision
1015988 with all the cuts the government is making we are expecting to save 2 0 billion ringgit annually
1015989 i understand the suffering of the people and i hope these measures can help them
1015990 although the government does not want to burden the people tough decisions have to be made because it has a duty to guarantee that natural resources are used in an optimum way not just now but for future generations
1015991 the government is now taking measures to reduce the difficulties that result from rising prices
1015992 i want to reiterate that i have not met or known the mongolian woman mentioned
1015993 a terrible lie a malicious fabrication defamatory which is designed to tarnish my image
1015994 it is a desperate attempt by anwar ibrahim to divert the attention of the people from the sodomy allegation that he is facing
1015995 he came to see me complaining that he was sodomised by anwar ibrahim i wasnt even sure if it was true or not
1015996 i suppose he needed help and he knew one of my officers thats all he looked like he was in fear
1015997 he raja petra said these three people have thus far not been implicated in the murder nor called as witnesses by the prosecution in the ongoing trial at the shah alam high court
1015998 he was aware that it is a crime not to reveal evidence that may help the police in its investigation of the crime
1015999 we should therefore not let ourselves to be distracted by issues that are bound to crop up from time to time i have to focus on what i want to do
1016000 at the same time when there are problems which we should tackle then we should of course deal with it
1016001 i have jobs to do i cannot be just thinking about all the criticisms levelled against me
1016002 as politicians we are used to being criticised but the most important thing is to remain focus on the job and not be distracted or bothered by it
1016003 they said that they are used to seeing political situations in countries around the world and that malaysia is stable and the activities are still going on the economy is going on the administration is going on so far so well
1016004 they told me you are managing what is already a very difficult issue the increase in the global price of oil
1016005 we suspect he is either in hiding or someone is hiding him
1016006 the police in the country have been put on alert to find him and we have informed interpol and aseanapol as well as the police in neighbouring countries
1016007 we will close several roads leading to the area if necessary
1016008 we are protesting so that the government realises how badly the people are suffering with such a huge rise in fuel prices
1016009 the poor are facing a nightmare having to deal with such a big fuel rise as the price of basic food like rice and flour have also shot up
1016010 we are opposing the price increase because this is in the heart of every malaysian
1016011 you know the umno is in trouble when its party members start abandoning ship
1016012 i am not surprised at all he is saying it is a fabrication but he said the same thing last time
1016013 he will have lots of stories there is always conspiracy as far as he is concerned im not surprised at all
1016014 malaysia is one country where prime ministers can walk about the streets safely and not get shot at
1016015 when i go shopping i dont feel threatened at all my bodyguards if there are actually stay away from me
1016016 when people approach me there is no problem at all i am not worried we are actually a very peaceful country
1016017 do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old seek what they sought
1016018 course with uncle bob one of the recurring themes during the week was that

1016114 how the area works within the overall community and in respect to sarpy county and also metro omaha
1016115 la vista quite frankly mayor kindig said really no locations were available
1016116 springfield because of its location these other locations were determined to be a little closer in to the omaha metro
1016117 theres a lot that can be done at each one of the five locations that were looking at

1016127 the remittance id tagging feature not only adds a connection between the check and the remittance document for added search functionality it also connects with the users accounting system for improved cross referencing and simplified payment reconciliation
1016128 tracking the remittance invoice or other relevant payment information at the point of scanning adds a level of control to accounting departments
1016129 reconciliation processes are usually labor intensive tedious and prone to a high level of exceptions the ability to capture a remittance tag at scanning brings a new level of efficiency
1016130 integrating the remittance feature throughout the entire process makes it easy for an accounting professional to access a live transaction real time
1016131 this includes deposits that are returned and later collected and paid attaining this level of detail in the check management process is often a manual process for most accounting departments now there is a single place for documenting and automating the lifecycle of a check payment even when returned

1016137 that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement he would then target those that had voted them in office
1016138 mitchs extensive experience in the financial services market and his product management and development background will be a great asset to tnb and our client partners

1016158 in the security world these forces disruptions come from three angles business innovation threat innovation and efficiency innovation the businesses we support are innovating for competitive advantage as are the bad guys for both of them its all about increasing the top line the last category is more internal efficiency innovation to increase the bottom line

1016168 like everything in the world there s a good side and a bad side
1016169 if the developer just had discipline hed to the right thing
1016170 if people would just do it right there wouldnt be a problem
1016171 we dont have time to do it right just throw something together and well fix it in test

1016176 then i heard a speed boat pulling out going really fast
1016177 i saw one person who walked off the boat and everybody else was taken off by stretcher from there
1016178 i think its horrible how anybody could do that and take off
1016179 we need barrels and people to be aware that they need to slow down

1016189 you could barely walk along the sand because there were so many jellyfish
1016190 we didnt get these years ago but now were getting the frequency of them a lot more
1016191 and they can be big weve had some that were just tremendous that weve had to come and pick them off the beach because of the danger
1016192 jellyfish are really just a symptom of oceans in crisis
1016193 there were more than 20 million jellyfish in that lagoon right in front of the vacation homes which is good for learning more about them but not so good if you own one of those homes
1016194 oil companies of course everyone knowsthe exxonmobile had a record profit this quarter but did you also know that they paid 3 times as much in taxes to the federal government of course not what is a windfall profit
1016195 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy
1016196 the assumption that spending more of the taxpayers money will make things better has survived all kinds of evidence that it has made things worse

1016223 the test generators could not randomly generate valid games it s not hard to see why a valid game is a sequence of between 12 and 21 rolls all of which must be integers between 0 and 10 what s more within a given frame the sum of rolls cannot exceed 10 these constraints are just too tight for a random generator to achieve within the current age of the universe

1016230 in light of the recent and offensive statements by mccain on the right of same sex couples to adopt jennifer chrisler executive director of the family equality council wrote the following to the obama campaign
1016231 as a lesbian mother and the executive director of family equality council the national organization working to ensure equality for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender families by building community changing hearts and minds and advancing social justice for all families i know how hard parents work to raise happy healthy children regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identities regardless of how many parents or caregivers are present in a family all parents begin each day with their children at the forefront of their thoughts on behalf of diverse families i ask for your plan to recognize respect protect and celebrate all of the loving families you seek to represent these families want to know how your administration will address their needs what policies and positions will you take to make sure that all loving families are recognized respected protected and celebrated how will you lead all families to a brighter future
1016232 while we live in a nation that is enriched by a vast array of diverse traditions cultures and histories it is our commonality that most defines us the desire to build a life with a loved one to provide for a family and to have children who will grow and thrive these are desires that all people share regardless of race sex religion sexual orientation or gender identity my own experience has taught me this lesson well i was born to a single mother my devoted grandparents helped raise me and then i married the woman of my dreams and had two beautiful daughters we know that the cost of the american dream must never come at the expense of the american family for decades weve had politicians in washington who talk about family values but we havent had policies that value families instead its harder for working parents to make a living while raising their kids its even harder to get a break thats why ill double spending on quality after school programs so that you can know your kids are safe and secure and thats why ill expand the family medical leave act to include more businesses and millions more workers to let parents participate in school activities with their kids and to cover elderly care and well finally put federal support behind state efforts to provide paid family and medical leave well require employers to provide seven paid sick days each year well enforce laws that prohibit caregiver discrimination and well encourage flexible work schedules to better balance work and parenting for mothers and fathers thats the change that working families need we have to do more to support and strengthen lgbt families because equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle its about whether millions of lgbt americans can finally live lives marked by dignity and freedom thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to eliminate discrimination against lgbt families and thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws ill be a president that stands up for american families all of them

1016251 in terms of studios our key strategy is to drive our independent model as a long term competitive model and as announced we are adding two vivendi games studios to our model high moon the studio behind the bourne game and radical the developers of crash bandicoot and prototype
1016252 we had a dreadful time signing the club up because it wasnt a racing game it took us a year to sign that up given projects are getting bigger and bigger and bigger we were having to bankroll huge teams without a contract
1016253 our staff rely on us for their jobs its not a business its a family
1016254 we were fighting against the in house developers a publisher will always support their internal teams as they make more money from them than an external
1016255 we wanted to write games we didnt want human resources or signing off purchase orders
1016256 people sit there and say we were really worried about staff mortgages and then pick up a 50m cheque later people are never just open and never say the offered me so much money a vulgar amount of money i fell of my chair they gave us so much money
1016257 i used to think that an exit strategy referred to what we would do if there wasa fire in our office the whole expansion all the away through has only been what we needed to do to survive we could have asked for more money what we wanted out of it was that we could support our families and that our employees would feel secure if selling was the primary concern we could have hired an agent put the word out amongst publishers and had them fighting against each other selling the studio was the last thing we had on our minds but activision happened to be the ones to say would you like to join our independent studios model
1016258 we talked off the record to a lot of people who had worked with activision and even talked to people who have fallen out with activision too
1016259 we have an external producer who comes and sees us the way we always have

1016268 and the only reason we associate nudity as sexual is because we have to take our clothes off to have sex

1016276 consumer prices in the eu 15 went up by 2 percent over 2000 2006 while in slovakia the rise reached 4 12 percent
1016277 during the dzurinda administration the regulatory office for network industries rso failed to regulate energy prices effectively households had to pay more for electricity than in the eu 15 and the companies made huge profits
1016278 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
1016279 a judge will order the organisation not to use such dishonest conditions in the future
1016280 this will be more effective than individuals filing hundreds or even thousands of suits on their own im calling on citizens to turn to the nearest consumers associations which are prepared to take such action
1016281 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything

1016332 the department for culture media and sport agreement that governs the help scheme urgently has to be reviewed
1016333 the help scheme should not open the floodgates for marketing practices and advertising of additional products or services to older and disabled consumers which can leave them stressed and confused
1016334 it is inappropriate for the scheme to select as standard such a confusing commercial deal when it is geared to encourage vulnerable customers to opt for a potentially confusing or costly installation

1016362 there are fixed functions and logical steps one has to go through in a gpu but those things are in there for a very good reason those are the most efficient ways to do graphics programming
1016363 this is really a multi core cpu what makes it different from the x86 we are using in our computers is this ring communication for interprocessor communications that is one of the main differentiators between larrabee and nehalem
1016364 i think its fantastic that intel has done this because this is the first innovation in computer graphics architecture since the gpu was introduced almost ten years ago so they get a lot of credit from me for being brave enough to do it
1016365 gives you a really fat communication path for every processor to talk to every other processor thats something they have that neither ati nor nvidia have
1016366 nvidia and ati have an order of magnitude more processors but are built in groups or gangs and communicate from group to group so processor 004 cant talk directly to processor 794
1016367 if a developer finds something in the api that limits them they can create their own
1016368 we want to insure developers the freedom to run in larrabee as they need
1016369 we want to give them freedom but we are wary of the potential for splintering so its a balancing act

1016407 one of the few comics blogs i always make time for
1016408 i work in fashion and therefore have a rather large collection of clothing jewelry shoes purses etc the problem has always been how to store this stuff in a way that protects it as well as makes it easy to access as a city dweller ive come to the realization that ill never have a giant walk in closet but i thought there must be something small i can do to give myself that luxurious and organized walk in closet feeling previously all my jewelry was stored in my boyfriends old fishing tackle box luckily hes not exactly an avid fisherman so i think the box had only been used once or twice therefore its not stinky while flipping through an issue of domino magazine i came across an amazing walk in closet with an equally amazing jewelry storage cabinet i quickly flipped to the sources page and discovered that the jewelry chest of my dreams was designed by george nelson pic right sadly it was 1400 slightly out of my budget especially for a jewelry chest even though i couldnt get the nelson chest at least now i knew what type of thing i wanted and so began my quest for the diy version after mulling it over for about 6 months i happened to be picking up some frames at our local ikea and lo and behold what did i find but the perfect substitute in these drawers now all i needed was the base i thought about trying to track down a vintage side table base but in the end i found what i needed at ikea as well by using the base of the fornbro side table cant find the link on ikeas website 1 i first stained the pieces 2 coats of stain and gave them about 8 coats of varnish with some sanding after the second and sixth coats i did so many coats of spray varnish in order to get a really smooth even finish 2 i then lined the inside of the drawers in vintage wrapping paper and covered the bottom with cream coloured felt i needed some way to keep all the earrings and necklaces untangled so the tiny metal tins with glass lids from lee valley tools were perfect they come in many different sizes and are surprisingly affordable 3 i attached the base with simple screws making sure they are only the depth of the thickness of the wood 4 lastly i attached the 3 drawer sections to each other with a zig zag of heavy duty glue in the centers of the sections to be glued together i used no more nails but i think a lot of other types of thick glue would work im so happy with how this project came out and most importantly i will now be giving all my jewelry the love it deserves simply because now i can actually find it all the only thing i might have to change is the base it seems a little less stable than i would like it to be i may add the round table top which i did not use and place it under the entire thing attaching it to the legs basically using the entire sidetable as it was intended but upside down i would then paint the table base entirely white since the round table top is black and doesnt really go with the look im going for its a pretty easy project and im very happy with how it came out i think it would look equally good with some other techniques like painting the wood or covering it with wallpaper or wrapping paper

1016446 there is an increasing capability of the iraqi security forces
1016447 they have grown tremendously even in the 11 months weve been here the capability of the iraqi security force has certainly contributed both the army and the police the sons of iraq are part of the security elements in the northern provinces and they have helped in some areas like hawijah samarra and some other places like that
1016448 are starting to get their act together and providing jobs for people
1016449 so there are good things going on across the board
1016450 and you also have to understand that the people of iraq are just tired of the fighting and it doesnt matter if youre sunni kurd shiia christian or syrians youre just sick of this unbelievably bad organization called al qaida which continues to do dastardly things throughout the northern areas and through the rest of the iraq so the people have stood up to these organizations as well
1016451 were starting to transition those elements into other organizations such as a civil service corps to help rebuild roads pipelines projects things like that
1016452 but were also seeing microgrants and microloans take charge and people actually getting normal work

1016456 the constancy of the black white iq gap is a myth blacks have gained 5 or 6 iq points on whites over the last 30 years neither changes in the ancestry of those classified as black nor changes in those who identify as black can explain more than a small fraction of this gain therefore environment has been responsible the last two decades have seen both positive and negative developments gains in occupational status and school funding have been accompanied by more black preschoolers in single parent homes and lower income in those homes neal in press we believe that further black environmental progress would engender further black iq gains

1016494 and consider the patience of our lord as salvation as our beloved brother paul according to the wisdom given to him also wrote to you speaking of these things as he does in all his letters
1016495 the setting up of the principle of mercy as opposed to severity ignores the fact that in the mind of the church the condemnation of error is itself a work of mercy since by pinning down error those labouring under it are corrected and others are preserved from falling into it

1016586 look this is my classroom my class my desks and my doughnuts just leave it on the desk if you dont want it

1016590 you realize that if jason comes in you will have to do ten pushups for him

1016602 catch on fire with enthusiasm and people will come for miles to watch you burn
1016603 but i thought this road led to the city of god
1016604 that path up the mountain where the desert begins does it lead to the city of god
1016605 everyone who has ever taken that path has been lost swallowed up by the desert if you want god there are plenty of good churches in this town you should pick one and settle down
1016606 if you stay here in christian city youll wither away you must take the path i belong to the desert you saw earlier i was sent here to encourage you to press on youll travel many miles youll be hot and thirsty but angels will walk with you and there will be springs of water along the way and at your journeys end you will reach the city of god you have never seen such beauty and when you arrive the gates will open for you for you are expected
1016607 but im afraid id never survive that desert im probably better off here in christian city
1016608 christian city is the place for those who want religion but dont want to lose their lives the desert is the territory of those whose hearts are so thirsty for god that they are willing to be lost in him my friend when peter brought his boat to land forsook all and followed jesus he was being swallowed by the desert when matthew left his tax collecting and paul his pharisaism they too were leaving a city much like this to pursue jesus out over the dunes and be lost in god so dont be afraid many have gone before you
1016609 if i do go out there how can i be sure that i will really be lost in god in the middle ages christians tried to lose themselves in god by putting the world behind them and entering a monastery and how disappointed many of them were to find that the world was still there and the people here in christian city who are preparing to go to some jungle or a neglected slum maybe theyre coming closer to what it means to be lost in god but then a person can travel to the ends of the earth and not lose himself
1016610 there is the city of god but before you reach it you will have to pass through those four wildernesses you see directly below us is the wilderness of forgiveness
1016611 well they arent really alone each one of them is accompanied by the forgiveness of god they are being swallowed by the desert of the lord gods vast mercy the holy spirit is saying to them as they travel behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world they are made whole as they travel
1016612 it looks like water but its a sea of sand thats the wilderness of worship here look through these glasses and you will see that people are walking there too notice how they begin to group themselves here they are having their first taste of the joy of the city worship they are discovering how they were made for the worship of god it is becoming their life the white hot source of everything they do
1016613 but dont people also worship back in christian city whats so special about that wilderness
1016614 worship that is true worship can begin only when a life has been utterly abandoned to the desert of gods presence out there the heart begins to worship the father in spirit and truth
1016615 passing through that wilderness travelers find it necessary to turn away from every distraction and concentrate on prayer they quickly learn that there is no possible way for them to survive but by crying out to god continuously by the time they reach the outer extremes of that wilderness prayer is their consuming passion and their supreme joy it appears at first that the city of god is just beyond the wilderness of prayer but there is one more wilderness hidden by those mountains which you will pass through before you reach your destination it is simply called the harvest youll know it when you reach it and beyond the harvest is the city itself your name is known there your arrival is awaited with eagerness come lets begin our journey
1016616 nightfall doesnt seem to be a particularly propitious time to begin a journey like this
1016617 not even at this hour that way i could get a good nights sleep and start first thing in the morning
1016618 walk on now into the desert the holy spirit will help you dont be afraid to be lost in god youll find your life nowhere else
1016619 to provide a fun environment that enables christian fellowship and growth
1016620 i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last i am the beginning and the end anyone who is thirsty may drink from the spring of the water of life
1016621 god is simple humanity is complex when we are young nothing is complex things are simply what they are when we mature we end up complicating all those things and we end up isolating ourselves from each other based on theology it is only by gods eternal patience that he can give us the grace to see his blessed simplicity so that we may love him gods simplicity is summed up in the words of jesus love god with all your might and love others as yourself its that simple
1016622 the permitting display of the sunrise rock cross in the preserve is an impermissible governmental endorsement of religion
1016623 the governments long standing efforts to preserve and maintain the cross atop sunrise rock lead us to the undeniable conclusion that the governments purpose in this case is to evade the injunction and keep the cross in place
1016624 carving out a tiny parcel of property in the midst of this vast preserve like a donut hole with the cross atop it will do nothing to minimize the impermissible governmental endorsement

1016650 brendon managed to get past me at the start and we were side by side into eau rouge and then i managed to slip stream him through les combes and get back into the lead
1016651 from there on it was a matter of controlling the race as i felt i was quick enough to win we really had the pace carlin motorsport have done a fantastic job and given us a great car all weekend
1016652 we showed that ade and i have a few nice combinations together
1016653 that is really important for two strikers you always have to work together you always have to look for each other hopefully this is a good start
1016654 i am getting better taking steps every day and i am really happy with how it is going
1016655 it is really important for me to get a good start which is why we are building everything up and we are two weeks on the way now
1016656 i learned a lot in the last two years because i have been injured so much
1016657 i learned what my body can take and what it cant so it was an interesting period for me
1016658 i hope next season will not be so unlucky with injuries
1016659 i just do not want to think about that negative stuff if you think positive you get positive
1016660 flamini was a free agent so he could make this decision alex went but this is football and has been happening for many years
1016661 of course i wanted everyone to stay but this is not how life is

1016663 arsenal have to win something every year that is our aim if it is not happening then everyone is really disappointed
1016664 i think any of the top four can win the title
1016665 troubles with the financial sector the economy the u s consumer theres no quick fix
1016666 it means there is some inflation leaking into the system and it puts the fed in a difficult position
1016667 but given the weakness of the economy it means theyre going to have to tolerate more inflation than they like
1016668 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
1016669 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
1016670 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
1016671 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
1016672 we warned folk to only deal with authorized ticket suppliers
1016673 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
1016674 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
1016675 there may be tickets on ebay that are delivered but i think it is a great risk that would be my message
1016676 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1016677 we are also urging video game arcades to pull the games from service
1016678 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1016679 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse

1016691 from a credit perspective the uk higher education sector has made positive strides over the past few years but faces increasing risks in the medium to long term
1016692 although we view universities in general as benefiting from strong government support individual universities may be allowed to fail particularly when there is insufficient student demand
1016693 instead any effect is more likely to be felt by the newer less research oriented universities
1016694 such universities may well need to look abroad for their recruitment and also diversify their offering to include more adult education and professional courses if they are to maintain current levels of activity
1016695 there has also been more intense pressure to spend on infrastructure which can be vital in recruiting top research staff from overseas competing for international students and coping with the rising expectations of home and eu students
1016696 given the upcoming demographic decline of 18 year olds and the effects of increased globalisation universities must judge whether their planned level of investment in staff and facilities is justified by the realistic prospect of higher revenues in the long term

1016719 why should fewer academics believe in god than the general population i believe it is simply a matter of the iq academics have higher iqs than the general population several gallup poll studies of the general population have shown that those with higher iqs tend not to believe in god
1016720 linking religious belief and intelligence in this way could reflect a dangerous trend developing a simplistic characterisation of religion as primitive which while we are trying to deal with very complex issues of religious and cultural pluralism is perhaps not the most helpful response

1016724 this in part is because radio serves as a powerful discovery engine for new music
1016725 however the medium today is one way thats about to change thanks to sophisticated mobile devices the broadband connected cellphone turns this experience into one that harnesses crowds to become far more personalized
1016726 all you need to do to see this yourself is to buy an iphone and download some of the free streaming audio applications such as pandora and last fm
1016727 the iphone 3g and other smart phones like it will change how people access and interact with audio already the pandora music discovery service is the fourth most popular application in the itunes store and bloggers such as jeff jarvis say they believe it will disrupt radio i tend to agree
1016728 the cellphone will change the radio landscape by not only establishing a two way modality but by ushering in new models for advertising that are mapped to peoples musical tastes and that are perhaps locally relevant as well thanks to gps this may be one of the most promising mobile ad formats and is a space to watch

1016786 rolf schreiber an engineer with rechargeit says that beyond these initial investments google is also looking to back companies that build software that can control the rate at which plug in vehicles charge and much the way google has built a business of providing information via the web the company could add its broadband expertise to the future of connected transportation
1016787 efforts to push plug in vehicles as a way to build out a smarter power grid and to bring some of the intelligence of information technology to transportation will be worth watching

1016806 for a marketing job the candidate bought a pair of baby shoes wrapped one in a box along with her r sum and sent it directly to the hiring authority
1016807 the box had a tag that said let me get my foot in the door and you will be pleased when she went to the interview she took the other shoe with her which was a great way to start the interview
1016808 the monday after my assignment ended i came in early and fished some important looking papers out of a recycling bin i found an empty office with a computer whose monitor didnt face the door and sat in it surfing the net for a few hours every day
1016809 the next day i received a fedex package from him with a book of poetry on human loss and a loving letter about how his mother had died that week

1016827 any time an athlete does something extraordinary anymore its how can that be
1016828 because its happened so many times the heroes keep crumbling under the weight of scandals
1016829 i have the perception that you want to believe and you should give someone the benefit of the doubt
1016830 but unfortunately other athletes in the past have ruined that for a lot of people
1016831 its interesting to me how effective sports fans are at being in denial
1016832 now its become harder and harder for people to do that
1016833 we like those comeback stories we like people overcoming odds
1016834 everybody in masters that ive talked to is just ecstatic
1016835 its just phenomenal what shes done for a lot of us being older athletes it shows weve still got it baby
1016836 with any kind of scandal or allegation if you like the person you think its so unfair to jump on them or make an assumption
1016837 that was something in the back of my mind that wow shes really at that level at that age
1016838 there was too much evidence there there was too much pointing to him and so i became disinterested

1016866 it was important for the visual effects to look as though they were shot on set he didnt want the film to take on a gimmicky visual effects look
1016867 by shooting in imax format we could fill the whole frame and the images are sharper and have more detail
1016868 but the vendors had to work in much larger resolution and logistically it was a difficult movie to finish
1016869 the visual effects go into the cracks forming backgrounds and foregrounds
1016870 theyre always there to support the images in a scene never the reason to do the scene
1016871 so we had to upgrade our whole infrastructure we needed faster network speeds to move data around massively beefed up servers and the most important thing a new compositing solution
1016872 shake falls over with images much more than 3k resolution
1016873 its a separate standalone set of tools not a plug in
1016874 a kind of overlay users could transition to the new software easily
1016875 in 1999 when we worked on pitch black released in 2000 we needed to access 2 tb of data
1016876 for batman begins we had 200 renderman licenses each of which ran on dual processor machines
1016877 for this film we beefed up to 900 licenses each running on four processors 3600 processors the limiting factor was how much power we could get into the building
1016878 we tripped the fuses twice but there were no other outages
1016879 we did those shots at 8k after that we went down to 5 6k except for high contrast shots where the camera lingers on vehicles and architecture
1016880 we had to create more environments from scratch and had more matte paintings than in batman begins
1016881 we also built the digital batpod and batmobile and all those assets had to hold up in full frame harsh lighting conditions things we could get away with at 2k wouldnt cut the mustard on dark knight
1016882 for example they attempted to do the shot of the batmobile turning into the batpod as a physical effect with rigs but chris wasnt getting the speed and energy he wanted so we did a digital version
1016883 we tracked the batpod into live action plates filmed in chicago but in some cases we needed a digital road for new camera moves
1016884 the only way was to photograph the road in excruciating detail we recreated a quarter mile of lasalle street and 250 yards of lower wacker drive to one centimeter resolution
1016885 we can give it point tracks from any source and it will give us a solve for the camera
1016886 the difference is that the imax camera uses proprietary mounts to fit the lens to the camera body
1016887 we shot lens specific distortion grids but did all the other characterizations with the still lenses
1016888 with the 1ds mark ii we could shoot many times faster than before
1016889 wed wait for a gap in traffic or have the police stop traffic for 10 minutes for batman begins we had to wait for nighttime it was the same for photographing the buildings we could wait for the light to be flat rather than wait for the buffer to empty
1016890 photoshop doesnt handle images above 4k very efficiently and its a closed tool so we couldnt get in there and add stuff to it working with photoshop was possible but slow it took three or four times longer than usual to paint the textures
1016891 you cant realistically buy a 5 6 x 3 6k monitor and the highest resolution digital projector is about 4k
1016892 it was a minimum of 10 days before we saw the shots back in the uk
1016893 you have to rewind and go again so we had only a couple chances to view the output
1016894 it was like 10 or 15 years ago when it was difficult to view 2k frames on digital monitors
1016895 but this is what 3d artists in particular have always done were used to looking at low res images during the process
1016896 we expected it to be a little harder but it was way harder these days we work with people all over the world send images digitally and get feedback but with physical film theres a big delay and matching the color space was harder because they didnt do a digital grade so we had to match the imax output recorders they still use crt recorders which have a different color response than the laser output recorders most people use today so we had to put work into that
1016897 wally would go into the lab and call the lights and theyd print it
1016898 they tell the same story but because of the size of the images in imax we had to do things differently so we had to find technical ways to make all the versions and compute them it took a lot of organization
1016899 we worked at imax resolution all the way through and then did a 2 40 extraction
1016900 taking the cinemascope slug out of the larger picture and then downresing to 4k we initially started working in 2k for cinemascope but decided that since we had the resources to do imax at 5 6k wed do the scope at 4k
1016901 the telecine operators set up the racking for the color cine transfers to give editorial a safe image for projection but we got a scan of the whole negative so there was a discrepancy
1016902 tiny things like that wouldnt normally make much difference in 2k resolution but everything in imax gets magnified
1016903 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1016904 shiloh calls them her babies she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mommies
1016905 this is mads fourth fifth time becoming an older bro hes asking us when we can have more
1016906 if they had been conceived through ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1016907 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1016908 viv is proving to resemble ange in spirit attitude and physicality and knox a bit of me

1016910 w ten spos b jak twierdz przeciwnicy instalacji naruszane jest ich prawo
1016911 i was brought here to score goals and the fans will be expecting me to score those goals
1016912 so i need to make sure i do so i like it when there is pressure on me and i will try my best for the club and the fans
1016913 i know people are expecting me to fill the shoes of nicolas anelka but its going to be difficult because he is a very good player
1016914 we both play very different though and i just want to play my own game and do my best for the club
1016915 one day spurs are going to break into the top four but i dont see it happening this season
1016916 selling keane is a big gamble and bentley apart i am not impressed with the players they have brought in
1016917 if i was a spurs fan i would be concerned if dimitar berbatov linked with a move to manchester united goes i would be worried about a lack of firepower
1016918 darren bent has been scoring a lot of goals in pre season friendlies but he seems to find it much harder to score against the big boys
1016919 i know spurs have been linked with arshavin but i think he has been over hyped im not a big fan of modric either
1016920 he looks ordinary to me but i can only assume juande ramos knows what he is doing
1016921 i will not react because we want to keep our best players
1016922 ive heard nothing from stoke im at a huge club here and its really going places
1016923 you can see the players weve brought in and i think theyre a sign of some big things happening at the football club
1016924 im concentrating on being here i want to be part of this football club and what its all about until anybody tells me different then i really want to be here
1016925 i see a lot of potential here it gets harder in the premier league every year but us staying up last year has created the opportunity to bring the players in that we have this year
1016926 hopefully we have the platform now to push on and i really want to be a part of that the new players have not come to be part of a survival scrap they want a lot more than that and so do all of us

1016931 is all about the creation of a set of rules that will systematically make gospel faith all but impossible for anglicans in the 21st century
1016932 ive been very impressed with him and im pleased that weve got him here
1016933 hes a good kid and hes got the potential to become a very good player
1016934 someone rung me and recommended him we got him down here and we liked what we saw straight away
1016935 theres a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids weve got nothing in between really but i think he can bridge that gap
1016936 hes played out wide and through the middle for us in pre season but hes a forward player really
1016937 its been a good tour of the usa but the one disappointment is that i dont have some more people here with me
1016938 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1016939 its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1016940 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle
1016941 im hoping well have some in before the start of the season but im not going to turn around and say im totally confident because you never know what happens but yes im hoping that well end up getting a few in
1016942 michaels training is going really well and by the time we get back hell be ready to train with the group
1016943 the first game might be a bit too early but the second games a possibility hell be around the squad doing work with the ball and getting back into it tomorrow or wednesday

1016945 because instead of actually increasing americas domestic oil supply this is how obama thinks americans should try to alleviate burdensome pain at the pump
1016946 there are things that you can do individually though to save energy
1016947 making sure your tires are inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups you could actually save just as much
1016948 if there are no more problems he should be ready for the game after that tottenham on august 31
1016949 but when you have a knee injury you just never know i have been getting a progress report from the doctor every day

1016964 so in the evenings i need a break from drawings to give myself a bit of serenity and calm plus to me there is so much visual pollution out there that im not always happy about so home should be a refuge from all that
1016965 everything is very organized but when you open the cupboards you can see its sometimes a bit of a mess inside kind of like me
1016966 das robolab hat mir sehr viel freude bereitet da es durch seinen wettbewerbscharakter und die arbeit in einem unbekannten team einem projekt aus der realen berufswelt eines ingenieurs gleicht wir mussten eine gegebene aufgabe l sen unser fachwissen im hinblick auf mechanische und steuerungstechnische komponenten anwenden und dieses auch angemessen pr sentieren ich kann jedem studierenden die teilnahme am robolab nur empfehlen

1016973 i believe every american should have the opportunity to have affordable and available health care
1016974 offers incontrovertible evidence that he represents a third bush term here at home as well as in iraq asking up to two thirds of the american public to relinquish health insurance they like provided through their employer puts the mccain bush plan on life support
1016975 mccains proposal is similar to one that bush put forth in his 2007 state of the union address that plan which would have replaced employer tax breaks for health insurance with a 15 000 tax deduction for married couples flopped in congress failing to get even a committee hearing
1016976 i believe that everyone should get a tax credit of 2500 5000 for families if they have health insurance it is good tax policy to take away the bias toward giving workers benefits instead of wages it is good health policy to reward having insurance no matter where your policy comes from
1016977 for those with limited means my budget will provide new credits to afford health coverage up to a thousand dollars for an individual or 3 000 for a family
1016978 we need to help the cops program we need to provide them with the technology

1017068 and yet it seems to be doing the opposite in the doha round of international trade negotiations
1017069 its insistence on protecting its own industrial development is driving other countries to do the same and has been a major factor in the growing antiglobalization and protectionist sentiment around the world

1017194 so far we have noted that we have a very vibrant and strong group of journalists here fighting for the interest of the population
1017195 alhaji jose can be fittingly described as a pillar of the profession who was committed to the tenets and best traditions of journalism he was a doyen of no mean standing he was an erudite journalist an upright man who ensured that journalism was practiced as a tool for social reformation and development
1017196 he gave his all to the profession and was instrumental to the robust role journalism is now playing in our national life it is noteworthy that even after his retirement jose maintained his love and dedication to journalism by mentoring others and chairing the nigeria media merit award initiative

1017201 he will resume full training straight away and one of the first things he has to do is put back the 10 kilos he has lost
1017202 obviously everyone wants him back on the field as quickly as possible but were not putting any timescale on his return he will play when hes ready
1017203 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand
1017204 perhaps consumers all over the world will think china is all low end but we want to be the high end
1017205 to change that view is very difficult but we have no choice
1017206 to be fair to nicky he has made it clear from this time last year that he would prefer to leave and ply his trade elsewhere

1017211 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1017212 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1017213 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1017214 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season

1017217 the thing thats realistic here is that the concentrations that are effective or similar concentrations can be achieved in humans
1017218 theres a lot of work that needs to be done

1017225 so i wrote to her a diplomatic letter but with some hints of romance meaning i was very warm towards her
1017226 bureaucratic type letter saying the guest worker scheme was not under consideration
1017227 so i was a total failure in trying to seduce amanda vanstone she was not terribly impressed he admitted
1017228 no one in his or her right frame of mind would have said these things given this the best option would be for the teacher to be assigned to a desk job and not be allowed to be near youngsters anymore
1017229 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1017230 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some time getting used to someone else being in charge
1017231 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1017232 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1017233 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1017234 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1017235 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1017236 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1017237 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him
1017238 hes an excellent batter and demands respect with his batting

1017280 does my blog do a good job for getting my business found online
1017281 when people find my blog online do they stay to read and do they subscribe to come back
1017282 will readers grow to know like and trust me from reading my posts
1017283 does my blog make it easy for people to interact with me and use my services
1017284 oh thanks for stopping by ms prints or mr internet marketing
1017285 my questions back to them usually startle the person because so many start thinking about what they want to say other than what their target audience needs to hear here are a few
1017286 some businesses arent ready to commit resources or change their culture full transparency to adapt to a blog thats okay but all businesses must understand the power of blogging your brand is what people read about and talk about online you have to decide if you want to be a part of shaping that conversation around your brand
1017287 its particularly pleasing that a local player has come through the notts academy and made it into the national squad
1017288 hes a very committed player this is the opportunity hes been waiting for
1017289 darren will benefit from playing in the lions game and its a clear indicator that hes not been forgotten
1017290 it gives him another chance to play against south africa without the pressure of a test match environment and hopefully hell do well
1017291 it is a brave decision because kp hasnt done much captaincy before
1017292 but everything he has done in his career he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1017293 i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1017294 it was a bit too much for me during the last ashes series and affected my form as an all rounder but kevins a batsman and the captaincy shouldnt affect his ability
1017295 his batting his aggressive and his captaincy will be similar
1017296 he likes to work very hard and likes to think about all aspects of his game he has the backing of his team
1017297 when i originally signed him up for notts i saw his talent as batsman and bowler
1017298 im delighted for him but i think he will need all the help in the world the england players dont play county cricket and dont get experience of captaincy
1017299 kevin has to make sure he is still focused on his job as a batsman you cant have roy of the rovers as captain
1017300 you have to make the experienced paul collingwood the vice captain and you have to have former captains michael vaughan and nasser hussain giving him ideas
1017301 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
1017302 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards they were both successful so why not
1017303 the most important thing about being a leader is having the respect of the players because then they follow you and play for you
1017304 he needs to surround himself with a good unit he needs to back his own instinct
1017305 its often instinct you rely on on the field and man management off the field

1017405 ron artest cant splinter them he can shake them up though and the locker room of the toyota center is one of the few places where that might be a good thing given the personality of the rockets and their history of annual early postseason exits if lobbing artest into this group of good guys creates a concern that a passive roster will get run over by his strong will especially if dikembe mutombo does not re sign and a mountainous presence is lost it raises hope of new energy it also raises hope that artest will decide whether he is ron or bill and whether he will limit flip flopping on his future in houston to 39 times between new years and july but one thing at a time and the possibility of the moment is that he could reach texas with the most unexpected of attributes thats right ron artest emotional leader the eighth sign of the apocalypse

1017470 me sorprendi mucho la respuesta de la gente y me sigue sorprendiendo
1017471 it was only once we started talking about the idea that it sank in how many singles theres been from what about me right through to loud and in pieces all these songs mean so much to me and showcase a journey that ive been through with my songwriting and recording my career in general its great to have the new songs on the album as they are just a taste of what weve got planned for next year
1017472 we are looking at all of those options right now
1017473 weve got a number of options that we are looking at in terms of the life of mine that is sort of being looked at together with ourselves with barrick and with the joint ventures management
1017474 we still will do that as we said we would just as part of our good corporate governance in terms of looking at all our assets around the world but well be having a good look at all of our options with respect to it over the second half of this year
1017475 it is an important piece of our portfolio but it has relatively low margins
1017476 he didnt give an indication apart from he did say he would make a decision unlike his predecessor
1017477 so hes going to come back with a yes or a no
1017478 the only thing we ask is that we get treated the same in return this is a serious offer for bhp or for rio should they choose to do it

1017483 everyone can see now that the reserve bank is not tightening rates again in this cycle and its really a matter of how much it cuts and when
1017484 i think a lot of participants are now realising thats probably a bit too aggressive
1017485 whether its australia europe or the us most of these economies are facing the same kind of battles
1017486 there is the normal quarterly covenant that every business in our structure has to deal with but there are no lump sum payments of the type youre talking
1017487 on most analysts numbers you can also see the underlying assets are worth significantly more than the current share price
1017488 on our numbers there is still several dollars in it
1017489 as often happens when people lose sight of the fundamental value of the asset an opportunity arises its a minor surprise but it makes a lot of sense
1017490 the letter purports to transfer the deposits back to an exploration lease
1017491 we are currently in a pre feasibility study i have 2000 people on the ground i have a range of drill rigs and other equipment on the ground we will continue with our exploration
1017492 there was no claim that we had not met our obligations so it is very very difficult for us to understand exactly what is going on
1017493 weve had constant discussion with the guinean government with the president of the national assembly with the prime minister with the minister for mines the minister of finance and weve got very very strong support from the government
1017494 it appears that this activity is coming from the presidents office
1017495 most significant commercial initiative we have undertaken in employment in the past decade
1017496 a better result for fairfax because we get clients on both platforms rather than one
1017497 while we believe that premiers offer does not adequately recognise the underlying value of just group and its future growth prospects the special board committee acknowledges that in light of changed circumstances shareholders should accept premiers offer if it achieves acceptances of 50 per cent or more
1017498 just shareholders have two very clear choices they can accept premiers offer and benefit from a substantial cash and scrip component or they can risk premiers offer lapsing and a significant drop in justs share price
1017499 we are not lunatics that buy at the top of the market we waited last year when prices were too high and now the market has fallen we are extremely well positioned to exploit the downturn

1017505 the market is so volatile we are spending bits and pieces but we havent got the confidence to go fully invested
1017506 when i got back the albums first mix i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
1017507 the whole thing was a trip im still figuring out how i want to write about it and talk about the last few days that were so amazing i had an extraordinary tour you share experiences with other artists that is almost unfathomable it was about bringing people together and empowering them and making them feel good about themselves it was an amazing time in vancouver i had to stop the show and say excuse me excuse me do you realize what were doing it was like oh my god we are doing this together i hope people feel empowered about it and they got the information they need to achieve what they needed in their life
1017508 i was inspired by their humour by their sensitivity by what they wrote about by their energy by tegans zest for her work and her life and the way she looked at things also just the passion for their own work is inspiring i must say that it also changes your own perspective on yourself
1017509 unfortunately sometimes ill look on youtube and think oh my god why did i think that looked good why did i wear that so i cant really look at myself and live in the moment and let it go because youll never be who you think you are in your mind in your mind youre much taller laughs and your hair is long and flowing you look completely different
1017510 i had done two special projects at last and body acoustic which were great to do but i wanted to get back to making my regular work again and writing
1017511 i always love working in a community of artists its always a petrie dish it doesnt always come out the way you like but this one did when i got back the first mix of high and mighty i was in tears because it was the kind of music i wanted to make it was familiar yet modern
1017512 i tried not to make every vocal the same i tried to find the character of the story teller i especially loved in raging storm to sing in octaves in one song and the low octave in the next song lay me down it had intrigued me to bend over backwards to find these different characters it was tricky it was like a big old puzzle but we got it together
1017513 i was taking pictures like that because at a certain time in history as women we were sold a bill of goods
1017514 but this woman in the picture is still holding onto her disco ball her joy shes still having a party wherever she goes and shes going to keep her joy no matter what i thought using props like gnomes and the disco ball and the broom were pretty funny
1017515 we are delighted and pleased to have two such exciting artists as jack and alicia who were inspired by our film to join together their extraordinary talents in creating a unique sound for quantum of solace
1017516 its extremely exciting i cant believe its taken this long but ive already started putting the set list together and there are so many songs to play i have been inspired by some intimate shows i have done recently here and internationally and by playing theatres i can be closer to all the people who have taken my record home
1017517 you dont feel that connection when people take your albums home theres
1017518 i would have liked to tour earlier but im just glad i can finally mtell people the dates when they ask me when im touring next there are lots of songs from over the years people know to sing along with and im going to do some fun covers but i dont want to spoil the surprise
1017519 what must i do to live with god in heaven
1017520 what does god in his law tell you to do

1017647 how come men have nipples why hasnt evolution eliminated them by now as they are of no use whatsoever

1017746 i am not anti black im just pro white pride
1017747 thats sharp edge which we saw on the way in from penrith
1017748 each night espn nba com and youtube are flooded with clips of players soaring through the air for rim rocking dunks buzzer beating three pointers and blocked shots that make your jaw drop in amazement while those are all entertaining plays teams who win championships need players who are willing to get a little dirty and do the little things needed to help their team win as valuable and crucial as these players are to their respective teams success these players rarely get the credit or respect that they deserve
1017749 mbak kalo bisa itu nggak cuman mimpi dan rencana bisa direalisasikan githu
1017750 oke deh pak saya juga harus membicarakan dengan rekan rekan yang lain
1017751 perahuku telah penuh dengan harta bendaku aku tak dapat membawamu serta nanti perahu ini akan tenggelam lagipula tak ada tempat lagi bagimu diperahuku ini
1017752 wah cinta kamu basah dan kotor aku tak bisa membawamu ikut nanti kamu mengotori perahuku yang indah ini
1017753 tapi mengapa ia menyelamatkan diriku sedangkan aku tidak mengenalnya bahkan teman teman yang mengenalku pun tidak mau menolongku
1017754 hanya waktulah yang tahu berapa nilai sesungguhnya dari cinta itu
1017755 once considered the travel choice of last resort some say the confluence of rising gas prices airline headaches and the rise of discount bus carriers is creating a kind of renaissance in the bus industry
1017756 there is a remarkable cutthroat battle for market share on the east coast like nothing weve ever seen before

1017758 a growing number of people often young professionals that are jumping on the bus as their primary method of travel
1017759 rising airfares threaten to again make flying a service for the affluent

1017761 closed its hub in los angeles last month citing low ridership
1017762 thats probably the most confused i have been in a race car on what to ask for out of it
1017763 we were so loose the whole time thank you to all of my guys just for fighting because i was complaining a lot but i didnt really know what to tell them
1017764 it was really confusing and the car was way loose i think everybody was pretty loose but obviously we were even more loose the end result turned out decent because we ended up 19th out of it its not great but where we were running and what all the guys we were racing with for what they had at the end that was at least a decent points day
1017765 it was just really weird we would have one run where we would be decent and we would barely touch the car
1017766 i dont know if it was the tires or just the cloud cover but when we would put the next set of tires on i would be way loose and not touch anything that was probably the biggest frustration and the biggest confusion to me add comment
1017767 im just proud of todd and all my guys for everything that theyve done
1017768 it was the same car that we raced at indy last week they turned it around and fixed half the body and brought it here big improvement for us
1017769 we stick in there and fight even when they tell us were all done to come to pocono and finish in the top five is a huge accomplishment for me at the beginning there i was just up underneath somebody and think nemechek just got in the back there and we all kind of got jammed up i dont know if it was anybodys fault or not but it worked out good we were able to work on our car early and make it better and we just kept making it better all day
1017770 we already have democracy we have the rule of law i have established the rule of law and so my government is democratic
1017771 it was difficult because the majority of our budget is used for personnel and personnel is contracted for the school year
1017772 its unfair to schools we need to have the budget on time if legislators have to squabble they should squabble before june 30
1017773 theres no new program expansion and were looking at all our programs to make sure were not losing money
1017774 were very anxious to see the state budget solved so we can know how to move forward on those categoricals
1017775 dont spend more than what you have and be very very cautious
1017776 a responsible budget the governor has proposed a budget that solves californias long term chronic budget problems and fully funds education under proposition 98
1017777 overall there is more uncertainty over the education budget than there has been for years
1017778 i dont hate her its just i wouldnt prefer to hang out with her for a million years

1017786 it has to be rigorous because they are preparing these kids to pass the exit exam to get a diploma and to go to college
1017787 they serve an incredible niche of young people who come from all over the world and are english language learners
1017788 somehow in these schools theyve figured out how to create a community that values difference but that also values trust and support
1017789 review of the history of racial segregation in this country confirms that separate schooling has meant unequal schooling
1017790 thus we have many good reasons to be wary of the consequences of segregation on the basis of language no matter how good the plan or how benign the intentions
1017791 there is one to two hours of english language development at mainstream schools
1017792 for some students that works but for others its frightening confusing and frustrating
1017793 i want to study in a school that many people speak english well
1017794 the united states citizens they study in different school right so its hard to speak more english in my life
1017795 charges right now for the driver will probably be dwi and open containers well go from there

1017803 damascus will be taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap
1017804 iranian president plays host to syrian fm pledges no changes in bilateral relations with damascus despite its recent renewal of peace negotiations with israel
1017805 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death
1017806 a moment before beginning his supper masab son of west bank hamas leader sheikh hassan yousef glances at the friend who has accompanied him to the restaurant where we met
1017807 weather forecasters on sunday predicted thunder and rain in beijing on the day of the olympic opening ceremony and warned that organizers have repeatedly said rain is their biggest worry ahead of fridays opening ceremony which will feature more than 10 000 performers and a massive but top officials from the beijing meteorological bureau confirmed that bad weather was certain for the august 8 although they held out hope that the skies may clear for the evening ceremony
1017808 the fifth tropical storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season formed near a major oil and gas producing area of the northern gulf of mexico on sunday the u s national hurricane center said tropical storm edouard located around 95 miles southeast of the mouth of the mississippi river by 6 p m edt was expected to come ashore at close to hurricane strength in a few days on the texas coast the miami based hurricane center said

1017810 the national weather service issued a heat advisory for all of north texas until 7 p m monday
1017811 and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory
1017812 by extending the mossad director meir dagans tenure for another year until the end of 2009 israeli prime minister ehud olmert has put in place a vital constituent for a possible eleventh hour unilateral strike at irans nuclear facilities in his six years on the job the 61 year old external intelligence has proved his covert mettle in a variety of counter terror operations graduating most recently to a highly successful intelligence coup leading up to the demolition of syrias north korean plutonium reactor in al kebir last september
1017813 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will
1017814 when it comes to international affairs he will be a huge improvement on bush
1017815 47 civilians most of them women and children were killed when a us aircraft bombed a wedding party in eastern afghanistan on sunday
1017816 nothing ever happened even while it was happening it wasnt happening it didnt matter it was of no interest
1017817 when it comes to international affairs he will be a huge improvement on bush
1017818 ideology has surrendered entirely to values there are no sacred cows and no fossilised limits to the ground over which the mind might range in search of a better britain
1017819 mid level baathists are conducting what i would describe as a classical guerrilla type campaign against us
1017820 i found out 30 minutes ago this was going on so i hopped in the car and rushed down here

1017823 these softwares could be modded to first upload the data onto a central government server and then delete them off thus relieving the cyber cafe managers off the load and responsibility of collating the data and storing them for 6 months just a idea here do you think google profile shall be interested to make a deal with the ruling party to share this huge data in that case how much would the data sharing process be charged for
1017824 what i suggest is to include government issued identity numbers like pan number driving license number passport id etc as a part of the registration process
1017825 government does not have trained staff to check cyber crime
1017826 the act that was to provide relief from cyber crimes itself was drafted by computer illetrates so how do you expect that our intelligence will be able to keep up with the tech savvy killer machines
1017827 i know that the entire country will be shouting breach of privacy lack of co operation that a common man gives to the government just gives the courage to the killer machines
1017828 they have to only ensure that which person was logged in with that ip address is traceable logged verified

1017835 we turned to virtualization because our data center faces a constant need to add more servers while also being limited by the physical space available without expensive expansion
1017836 while it took us one year to get our high availability site up and running sungard came in and had our virtual recovery site ready to go in three weeks for our mission critical applications this experience demonstrates the value companies looking at virtualized recovery solutions can gain by tapping sungards expertise rather than handling internally
1017837 server virtualization will dramatically change the it recovery services model for both the services provider and the customer with replication to a shared storage infrastructure and a virtualized server infrastructure customers can enjoy improved recovery time and recovery point objectives without the cost of dedicated and custom recovery solutions from the dr service provider
1017838 the achilles heel of most virtualized it environments is that they rely on a single data center to facilitate system failover should an event occur
1017839 a recovery strategy with no off site data may mean quite possibly no recovery virtual server replication services provides organizations an affordable way to have access to a secondary data center for protection of physical and virtual it environments
1017840 keine au ergew hnlichen fortschritte von einem team in den drei igern erwarten
1017841 man ist nicht alt wenn man 30 oder 31 ist
1017842 bisher kannte ich ihn nur fl chtig jetzt sind wir jeden tag zusammen und ich freue mich darauf
1017843 wir haben uns bisher nur ein paar minuten unterhalten seit er hier bernommen hat aber er ist eine freundliche person und ein erfolgreicher trainer deshalb ist er hier
1017844 er ist ein wichtiger spieler f r chelsea und er hat viel f r den klub getan aber die entscheidung liegt bei ihm
1017845 wir werden sehen wie sich die dinge in den n chsten tagen entwickeln werden aber man kann nicht sagen dass die verhandlungen vorbei w ren
1017846 wie auch immer wir haben sicher gestellt dass wir auch ohne lampard ein wettbewerbsf higes team haben
1017847 openness to foreign media was a long term policy rather than a puff of wind
1017848 in the preparation for the games we will be open in every aspect to the rest of the country and the whole world we will draw on the successful experience of others and follow the international standards and criteria
1017849 if a few websites are difficult to browse its mainly because they have spread content that is banned by the chinese laws
1017850 the internet is regulated according to law in china just like in other countries
1017851 those of you who are good with code are welcome to create more complex customisations but as this is photography and not a web building course we are more interested in how you have applied photography in the context of a weblog

1017853 o lord our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth you have set your glory above the heavens from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger when i consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have set in place what is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him you made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor you made him ruler over the works of your hands you put everything under his feet all flocks and herds and the beasts of the field the birds of the air and the fish of the sea all that swim the paths of the seas o lord our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth
1017854 for some chinese companies you could argue they need only five to 15 years to develop a global brand
1017855 perhaps consumers all over the world will think china is all low end but we want to be the high end
1017856 to change that view is very difficult but we have no choice
1017857 they caught us in the bottom of the seventh on what i thought was a controversial play
1017858 we turned a double play that should have ended the game
1017859 that was a little disappointing to us that we thought we had the game won
1017860 on 3 and 1 i think hes going to throw me a strike as the bases are loaded
1017861 he gave me a fastball fortunately i put it in play down the left field line
1017862 it was a lot of fun because yesterday i thought we should have won tough call but we came through its a good team win
1017863 they played fantastically they had to our kids played fantastically also it came down to 10 innings
1017864 im very happy with them most of these guys have played together for a long time so we got together for one last time most of the guys are 19 its the last time well play together theyll go on to the adult leagues
1017865 its the best group of kids ive been coaching these guys since they were 9 and 10 years old these kids have been together for a long time and i love to coach them

1017869 quem j mergulhou em assuntos que interessam a todos ser respons vel em alinhar nosso conhecimento para que a conversa aconte a
1017870 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1017871 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1017872 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow
1017873 it is clear that the government of iran has not complied with the international communitys demand to stop enriching uranium and isnt even interested in trying
1017874 in whichever negotiation we take part it is unequivocally with the view to the realization of irans nuclear right and the iranian nation would not retreat one iota from its rights
1017875 it is reflective of the failure of political will across the board on everything that has to do with darfur and sudan
1017876 it means a way of responding timely to incidents as they occur around the darfur region and the troops can respond rapidly to incidents when they are developing
1017877 it is becoming very difficult to help darfuris on the ground who are suffering from continual attacks
1017878 people who are familiar with operations in iraq and would know that the lives of soldiers and civilians and chances of surviving from injuries improve dramatically with access to helicopters
1017879 in each case however when required to provide back up efforts it failed and the failure to provide helicopters has direct consequences for the people on the ground and for the peacekeepers
1017880 no heavy lift helicopters have been transferred or provided making it impossible for the force to be mobile confront aggression or even defend itself
1017881 since january first according to the secretary general 190 000 darfuris have been displaced and nine people have lost their lives
1017882 from the perspective of the coalition it is outrageous that the members of the security council send troops into a conflict zone without the minimum of the equipment needed to protect themselves
1017883 i encourage european governments and the united states to come forward and tell the world what theyve got available and what they can make available
1017884 if the international community is serious about fulfilling its responsibility to protect civilians in darfur it can start by providing the basics that
1017885 such support could have saved some of those peacekeepers who died this month gallantly trying to protect civilians the least we can do in their memory is to make sure that no more civilians or peacekeepers perish because of resource constraints
1017886 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
1017887 will have serious implications for stability in that region but also for the u n soldiers on the ground
1017888 its very likely that we will discuss this again over the coming months
1017889 the primary requisite for writing about food is a good appetite
1017890 did you understand the words that are coming out of your mouf
1017891 i want to go with you on one of your restaurant sojourns
1017892 come little red riding hood here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine take them to your grandmother she is ill and weak and they will do her good set out before it gets hot and when you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother will get nothing and when you go into her room dont forget to say good morning and dont peep into every corner before you do it
1017893 ven ccaperucita aqu esta un pedazo de la torta y una botella de vino ll velas a tu abuela ella esta
1017894 cake and wine yesterday was baking day so poor sick grandmother is to have something good to make her stronger
1017895 a good quarter of a league farther on in the wood her house stands under the three large oak trees you surely must know it
1017896 torta y vino ayer fue dia de hornear as que la abuela enferma debe tener algo bueno para hacerla m s fuerte
1017897 un buen cuarto de una liga en el bosque su casa est debajo de los tres
1017898 what a tender young creature she will be better to eat than the old woman i must act carefully
1017899 see little red riding hood how pretty the flowers are about here
1017900 qu criatura joven y blanda ella ser mejor para comer que la vieja debo actuar cuidadosamente
1017901 vea caperucita roja c mo son bonitas las flores que est n alrededor de aqu por qu no h gale no mirada redondee creo tambi n que usted no oye c mo los peque os p jaros est n cantando dulce usted camina grave adelante como si usted fuera a la escuela mientras que todo hacia fuera aqu en la madera es feliz
1017902 estoy trayendo la torta y el vino abra la puerta
1017903 oh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you have
1017904 oh pero abuela qu boca tan grande y terrible tienes
1017905 ah how frightened i have been how dark it was inside the wolf

1017907 he was so moved by its power that he got out of bed put on a suit and tie and sat up the rest of the night reading because it would have been an insult to read such an epic in his pajamas
1017908 many use the term flat earther as a term of abuse and with connotations that imply blind faith ignorance or even anti intellectualism
1017909 coming across some literature from the flat earth society a few years ago
1017910 i came to realise how much we take at face value
1017911 we humans seem to be pleased with just accepting what we are told no matter how much it goes against our senses
1017912 the earth is flat and horizontally infinite it stretches horizontally forever
1017913 obviously it isnt perfectly flat thanks to geological phenomena like hills and valleys it is around 24 900 miles in diameter
1017914 sheer incredulity to the conviction that its all just an elaborate joke
1017915 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
1017916 its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
1017917 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
1017918 alright already response out of him and it might give those young voters he is counting on the idea that hes not only not as different as they thought but maybe just not different enough
1017919 collected only on products purchased by public bodies for their own use and not on imports as such and that the levy was charged not at the time of importation but when the purchase price was paid by the public body
1017920 when or where the internal charge is collected is not necessarily the decisive criterion to indicate that it falls within the scope of article iii 2 of the gatt 1994
1017921 whether under chinas schedule of concessions the tariff provisions for motor vehicles include in their scope auto parts imported separately in multiple shipments that are found to have the essential character of a motor vehicle based on their assembly into a motor vehicle
1017922 any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished provided that as presented the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article
1017923 the wco secretariat adds that the hs is silent on
1017924 in light of the evidence discussed above we are not persuaded that an interpretative rule on tariff classification under the hs was intended to address issues relating to the circumvention of tariff duties
1017925 object and purpose section the panel once again revealed its export bias
1017926 heres what its like a man runs from a lion right into the jaws of a bear a woman goes home after a hard days work and is raped by a neighbor

1017930 it is the duty of every citizen according to his best capacities to give validity to his convictions in political affairs
1017931 my conviction is that the best capacities are validated through blogging a speech act such as a blog entry represents the synthesis of thought and action thus validating conviction
1017932 the place where men meet to seek the highest is holy ground

1017938 stonefly takes pride in its commitment to open source solutions as a critical component of sans and there is no better place to demonstrate that commitment than at linuxworld
1017939 3ware pioneered the first sata raid controllers with in kernel linux driver support and now continues the winning linux legacy with 3ware sas controllers

1017946 everyone knows how easy it is to fall into the trap of procrastination while the computerized exam is a great step forward the continuous nature of it makes it too easy for candidates to delay sitting
1017947 we did a complete reengineering of our performance management and advancement policies and procedures one aspect is that accounting graduates entering the firm have two years from their employment date to pass the cpa exam

1018103 los criterios que el ministerio de fomento ha presentado para justificar que tan s lo unas comunidades aut nomas podr n participar en los rganos de gesti n de los aeropuertos tiene como fondo dar cobertura a las exigencias del estatuto de autonom a de catalu a primando una vez m s a unas comunidades en detrimento de otras

1018123 los datos de julio y de los meses anteriores y sobre todo la evoluci n en t rminos interanuales y el diferencial con los datos estatales muestran el agotamiento de un modelo de crecimiento insostenible basado en la construcci n y que ha hecho muy poco por evitar el deterioro de los sectores industriales creadores de mayor valor a adido
1018124 necesidad de un replanteamiento fundamental por parte de las administraciones que permita asentar un nuevo modelo de crecimiento y de empleo y que tenga como referentes fundamentales los criterios de sostenibilidad y estabilidad en el empleo

1018161 its a non technical climb so you dont need specific skills
1018162 jika yang terjadi demikian maka kelihatannya syaitanlah yang berbicara lewat mulut nya yang kemudian ditulis dalam buku tersebut
1018163 allah taala mengingkari orang yang keluar dari hukum allah yang mantap dan sempurna meliputi segala kebaikan yang tercegah dari segala keburukan lalu orang itu berpaling kepada hukum yang lainnya yang berasal dari pemikiran pemikiran dan hawa nafsu dan peristilahan yang dibuat oleh pembesar pembesar mereka tanpa sandaran dari syariat allah sebagaimana kaum jahiliyyah berhukum dengannya yang berasal dari kesesatan dan kebodohan yang semua itu diletakkan di atas dasar pandangan pandangan logika dan hawa nafsu mereka
1018164 barangsiapa meninggalkan hukum yang muhkam baku yang diturunkan kepada muhammad ibnu abdillah penutup para nabi dan dia malah merujuk hukum kepada hukum hukum allah yang sudah dihapus maka dia kafir maka apa gerangan dengan orang yang mengacu kepada ilyasa yasiq dan dia mendahulukannya daripada ajaran allah maka dia kafir dengan ijma kaum muslimin
1018165 dan semuanya itu mengikuti syariat allah yang diturunkan kepada hamba hamba nya para nabi shalawat dan kesejahteraan atas mereka
1018166 apakah hukum jahiliyah yang mereka kehendaki dan hukum siapakah yang lebih baik daripada hukum allah bagi orang orang yang yakin
1018167 maka demi rabb tuham mu mereka pada hakikatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim dalam perkara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
1018168 sebagian besar manusia bertanya tanya dengan alasan apakah negara tartar harus diperangi mereka telah masuk islam dan tidak membangkang terhadap imam
1018169 orang orang tartar tiada lain seperti orang orang khawarij yang membangkang dari ali bin abu thalib dan muawiyah bin abu sofyan orang orang khawarij berpendapat bahwa mereka lebih berhak dalam masalah ke khalifah an daripada ali bin abu thalib dan muawiyah bin abu sofyan orang orang tartar juga berpendapat bahwa mereka lebih berhak menegakkan kebenaran daripada kaum muslimin lainnya
1018170 jika kalian lihat saya berada di pihak pasukan tartar dan di kepalaku terdapat mushaf maka bunuhlah aku
1018171 jika kalian infakkan dana kalian di jalan allah untuk mengusir musuh maka itu lebih baik bagi kalian dan lebih besar pahalanya beliau menegaskan bahwa jihad melawan pasukan tartar hukumnya wajib bagi setiap yang mampu

1018173 hendaknya engkau beriman kepada allah para malaikat nya kitab kitab nya para rasul nya hari akhir dan hendaknya pula engkau beriman dengan qadar baik maupun buruk
1018174 ingatlah menciptakan dan memerintah hanyah hak allah maha suci allah rabb semesta alam
1018175 dia lah allah yang menjadikan segala yang ada di bumi untukmu
1018176 sesungguhnya allah dia lah maha pemberi rizki yang mempunyai kekuatan lagi sangat kokoh
1018177 kepunyaan allah katakanlah maka apakah kamu tidak ingat katakanlah maka apakah kamu tidak bertakwa katakanlah siapakah yang di tangan nya berada kekuasaan atas segala sesuatu sedang dia melindungi tetapi tidak ada yang dapat dilindungi dari adzab nya jika kamu mengetahui mereka akan menjawab kepunyaan allah katakanlah allah katakanlah kalau demikian maka dari jalan mankah kamu ditipu sebenarnya kami telah membawa kebenaran kepada mereka dan sesungguhnya mereka benar benar orang orang yang berdusta
1018178 hanya kepada engkau lah kami beribadah dan hanya kepada engkau lah kami memohon pertolongan
1018179 dan barangsiapa beribadah kepada ilah yang lain di samping allah padahal tidak ada suatu dalilpun baginya tentang itu maka sesungguhnya perhitungannya disisi rabb nya sesungguhnya orang orang yang kafir itu adalah beruntung
1018180 tidak ada ilah yang berhak diibadahi dengan benar kecuali allah
1018181 dan kami tidak mengutus seorang rasul pun sebelummu melainkan kami wahyukan kepadanya bahwasanya tidak ada ilah yang hak melainkan aku maka beribadah kamu hanya kepada ku
1018182 dan aku tidak menciptakan jin dan manusia melainkan agar mereka beribadah kepada ku
1018183 ingatlah hanya kepunyaan allah lah agama yang bersih dari syirik
1018184 laa ilaha illahlahu tidak ada ilah yang diibadahi kecuali allah
1018185 beribadah kepada allah dan jangannlah kamu mempersekutukan nya dengan sesuatu pun
1018186 tidak ada sesuatupun yang serupa dengan nya dan dia lah yang maha mendengar lagi maha melihat
1018187 hanya milik allah asmaul husna maka bermohonlah kepada nya dengan menyebut asmaul husna itu dan tinggalkanlah orang orang yang menyimpang dari kebenaran dalam menyebut nama nama nya nanti mereka akan mendapatkan balasan terhadap apa yang telah mereka kerjakan
1018188 maka janganlah kamu mengadakan sekutu sekutu bagi allah sesungguhnya allah mengetahui sedang kamu tidak mengetahui
1018189 dan tiadalah yang diucapkannya itu al qur an menurut kemauan hawa nafsunya ucapannya itu tiada lain hanyalah wahyu yang diwahyukan kepadanya
1018190 dia lah yang awal dan yang akhir yang zhahir dan yang bathin dan dia maha mengetahui segala sesuatu
1018191 apakah allah yang menciptakan itu tidak mengetahui yang kamu lahirkan dan kamu merahasiakan dan dia maha halus lagi maha mengetahui
1018192 sesungguhnya allah dia lah maha pemberi rizki yang mempunyai kekuatan lagi sangat kokoh
1018193 para ulama bersepakat bahwa dia bersemayam di atas arsy dan mengetahui segala sesuatu apa yang di bawah lapisan bumi yang tujuh
1018194 kepada nyalah naik perkataan perkataaan yang baik dan amal yang shahih dinaikkan nya
1018195 tidaklah kalian percaya kepadaku sedang aku adalah kepercayaan siapa yang di atas langit
1018196 kursi allah meliputi langit dan bumi dan allah tidak merasa berat memelihara keduanya dan allah maha tinggi lagi maha besar
1018197 sebenarnya tangan merekalah yang dibelenggu dan merekalah yang dilaknat disebabkan apa yang telah mereka katakan itu tidak demikian tetapi kedua tangan allah terbuka dia menafkahkan sebagaimana dia kehendaki
1018198 apakah yang menghalangi kamu iblis sujud kepada yang telah ku ciptakan dengan kedua tangan ku
1018199 sesungguhnya aku beserta kamu berdua musa dan harun aku mendengar dan melihat
1018200 dan tetap kekal wajah rabb mu yang mempunyai kebesaran dan kemuliaan
1018201 pada hari betis disingkapkan dan mereka dipanggil untuk bersujud maka mereka tidak kuasa
1018202 allah tidak ada rabb yang berhak diibadah melainkan dia yang hidup kekal lagi terus mengurus makhluk nya
1018203 wajah wajah orang orang mukmin pada hari itu berseri seri kepada rabb nyalah mereka melihat
1018204 sesungguhnya kalian akan melihat rabb kalian seperti kalian melihat bulan di malam bulan purnama kalian tidak akan berdesak desakan saat melihat nya
1018205 rabb kita tabaraka wa taala turun pada setiap malam ke langit dunia ketika tinggal sepertiga malam yang terakhir seraya berfirman siapa yang berdoa kepada ku maka pasti aku memperkenankan doanya siapa yang meminta kepada ku maka aku memberinya dan siapa yang memohon ampunan kepada ku maka aku mengampuninya
1018206 jangan berbuat demikian apabila bumi digoncangkan berturut turut dan datanglah rabb mu sedang malaikat berbaris baris
1018207 tiada yang mereka nanti nantikan melainkan datangnya allah dan malaikat pada hari kiamat dalam naungan awan dan diputuskan perkaranya
1018208 risalah itu datangnya dari allah dan tugas rasul adalah menyampaikan risalah tersebut sedang kewajiban kita adalah taslim patuh tunduk
1018209 semua yang allah taala sifatkan untuk diri nya dalam al qur an maka bacaannya adalah tafsirnya tidak ada kata bagaimana dan tidak ada tandingannya
1018210 aku beriman kepada allah dan apa yang datang dari nya sesuai dengan apa yang dimaksud allah aku beriman kepada rasul nya dan apa yang datang darinya sesuai dengan apa yang dimaksudkan rasulullah
1018211 aku bertanya kepada sufyan bin uyainah dan malik bin anas tentang hadits hadits dalam masalah sifat dan ruyah maka mereka menjawab
1018212 ahli bidah adalah mereka memperbincangkan asma allah sifat sifat nya kalam nya ilmu nya dan kekuasaan nya mereka tidak diam seperti diamnya pada sahabat dan orang orang yang mengikuti mereka dengan baik diriwayatkan oleh imam al baghawi dalam kitab syarhus sunnah i 217
1018213 seseorang tidak boleh berbicara sedikit pun tentang dzat allah namun hendaknya ia mensifati nya dengan sifat sifat yang telah allah sifatkan untuk diri nya dan tidak mengatakan dalam hal ini dengan sependapatnya semata mahasuci allah lagi maha tinggi rabb semesta alam
1018214 dia turun dan jangan bertanya bagaimana dia turun lihat syarhul aqiidah ath thahaawiyyah tahqiq syuaib al arna uth dan dr abdul muhsin at turki hal 264 269
1018215 barangsiapa menyerupakan allah dengan makhluk nya maka ia telah kafir dan barangsiapa mengingkari apa yang telah allah sifatkan untuk diri nya maka ia telah kafir apa yang allah sifatkan untuk diri nya maupun disifatkan oleh rasul nya bukanlah tasybih penyerupaan
1018216 pijakan islam tidak akan kokoh kecuali di atas jembatan taslim penyerahan diri kepada allah dan rasul nya
1018217 the suspect slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to kill the woman totally severing her head
1018218 the attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other
1018219 en el momento en el que un sistema se rompe se lanza al vuelo la campana del s lvese quien pueda y cuando el gobierno le da la oportunidad a los aeropuertos ricos de salirse del sistema todo el mundo quiere huir de un sistema que se est rompiendo
1018220 prefieren que se mantenga el sistema a que se deshaga
1018221 nunca habr n visto a la generalitat reclamar que el puerto de valencia salga del sistema nacional de puertos
1018222 ahora bien si el sistema se rompe y catalu a se lleva sus aeropuertos y a baleares le entregan porque va a pedirlos sus aeropuertos y al final a cada uno le dan su aeropuerto
1018223 lo que no va a hacer es no reclamar los suyos
1018224 prefiere sin ninguna duda y como todo el pp que se mantenga el sistema nacional de aeropuertos antes de que se disgregue
1018225 cu les tiene previsto cerrar en los pr ximos meses
1018226 quiere privatizar la gesti n de un sistema p blico tan importante como los aeropuertos
1018227 c mo va a mantener la rentabilidad de los m s peque os
1018228 muy d bil con los fuertes y muy fuerte con los d biles
1018229 a lo mejor solo existir an el de barajas el de palma o el de l altet
1018230 viene dado por la fuerte incidencia que ha tenido el desempleo en el sector de la construcci n cuya desaceleraci n ha afectado a los servicios complementarios y a la industria relacionada con el sector del ladrillo
1018231 es necesario que el consell implante ya pol ticas activas de empleo que potencien el sector industrial y acelere la ejecuci n de obra p blica para paliar el incremento del desempleo en la provincia ya que es la zona de espa a donde el paro ha crecido m s porcentualmente
1018232 por un modelo m s eficiente basado en los crecimientos de productividad que genere empleos estables y de calidad
1018233 un programa de asesoramiento integral que comprende tanto la informaci n sobre las convocatorias el asesoramiento a empresas la formaci n acompa amiento en la presentaci n de ofertas y organizaci n de misiones a los organismos contando en todo momento con el apoyo de la red exterior del ivex
1018234 deben ser aprovechadas por las empresas valencianas porque est n plenamente capacitadas para acceder a ellas
1018235 en el sector servicios principalmente concretamente en el rea de la consultor a e ingenier a
1018236 conscientes de la dificultades que conlleva acceder a estos proyectos internacionales
1018237 en el inicio de lo que puede ser un proyecto a largo plazo
1018238 agravio tan inexplicable como absurdo porque se podr a haber solucionado
1018239 no ten a que ir la alcaldesa de valencia rita barber sino que se podr a haber planteado una representaci n a otro nivel
1018240 quiz a valencia se le han subido los grandes eventos a la cabeza y ya no quiere tener relaciones con ciudades que quiz de tama o sean m s peque as pero que de intensidad cultural y de tradici n investigadora son muy beneficiosas e interesantes
1018241 pol tica de tierra quemada al dejar morir estas relaciones
1018242 lo que depende del ayuntamiento que es mantener una relaci n de cortes a y educaci n entre entidades se la saltan a la torera de forma gratuita cuando podr a haber sido solucionable con cualquier representaci n
1018243 se podr a desarrollar sin coste elevado porque la existencia de estas relaciones tan positivas y de nivel tan elevado son una satisfacci n para la ciudad
1018244 cuando lleg al gobierno local la ciudad estaba gris y ap tica
1018245 representa a todos los ciudadanos y no a su partido
1018246 estamos trabajando en nuestro compromiso de acercar y mejorar la sanidad a los ciudadanos
1018247 demuestra el esfuerzo que estamos haciendo desde el consell para que los ciudadanos puedan disponer de mejores instalaciones y recursos sanitarios aumentando la calidad de la sanidad p blica valenciana
1018248 se dar entrada a las comunidades aut nomas en la gesti n de aquellos aeropuertos cuya gesti n sea especialmente compleja dados los niveles de volumen del tr fico en el conjunto aeroportuario
1018249 abandone de una vez el victimismo habitual y se ponga a trabajar
1018250 cu les han sido sus intereses ocultos y cu les los del alcalde de silla
1018251 no contento con salir del pp sin abandonar el acta de concejal ha decidido entrar en el gobierno municipal
1018252 lo ocurrido va completamente en contra del pacto antitransfuguismo porque esta persona ha utilizado su cargo para beneficio propio y ha dejado completamente de lado los valores democr ticos que tan dignos son
1018253 fui yo personalmente el que llam a su puerta y afili a mi partido y ahora ha tomado la decisi n de salir del pp por motivos personales
1018254 imperfection is beauty madness is genius and its better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring
1018255 dan barangsiapa menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa terhadap kesesatan yang telah dikuasinya itu dan kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam jahannam itu seburuk buruknya tempat kembali
1018256 dan berpeganglah kamu semuanya kepada tali agama allah dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai
1018257 sesungguhnya orang orang yang beriman hanyalah orang orang kepada allah dan rasul nya kemudiaan mereka tidak ragu ragu dan mereke berjihad dengan harga dan jiwa mereka pada jalan allah mereka itulah orang yang benar
1018258 sungguh kamu akan mengikuti perilaku orang orang sebelum kamu sejengkal demi sejengkal dan sehasta demi sehasta
1018259 barangsiapa memberi contoh suatu sunnah perilaku yang baik dalam islam maka baginya pahala kebaikan tersebut dan pahala orang yang mengerjakannya setelahnya tanpa mengurangi sesuatu apapun dari pahala mereka dan barang siapa memberi contoh sunnah perilaku yang jelak dalam islam
1018260 kemudian seorang laki laki dari kaum anshar membawa membawa sekantung penuh kurma hampir hampir telapak tangannya tidak kuat untuk membawahnya bahkan benar benar lemah maka hal itu diikuti silih berganti oleh banyak orang
1018261 barangsiapa yang mencontohkan suatu sunnah yang baik dalam islam maka baginya pahala sunnah tersebut dan pahala orang yang mengamalkannya sesudahnya tanpa mengurangi pahala mereka sedikitpun dan barang siapa mencontoh suatu sunnah yang jelek buruk dalam islam maka dosanya akan ditanggungnya dan juga dosa orang yang mengamalkannya setelahnya tanpa mengurangi dosa mereka sedikitpun
1018262 barangsiapa memberi contoh suatu sunnah perilaku yang baik dalam islam maka baginya pahala kebaikan tersebut dan pahala orang yang mengerjakannya setelahnya tanpa mengurangi sesuatu apapaun dari pahalam mereka dan barangsiapa memberi contoh sunnah perilaku yang jelak dalam islam
1018263 sesungguhnya barang siapa yang hidup diantara kalian setelahkau maka akan melihat perselisihan yang banyak maka hendaknya kalian berpegang teguh pada sunnahku dan sunnah para khulafa ur rasyidin dimana mereka itu telah mendapat hidayah
1018264 dan berpeganglah kamu semua kepada tali agama allah dan janganlah kamu bercerai berai
1018265 dan janganlah kamu menyerupai orang orang yang bercerai berai dan berselisih sesudah datang keterangan yang jelas kepada mereka
1018266 sesungguhnya agama ini akan terpecah menjadi tujuh puluh tiga golongan tujuh puluh dua tempatnya di dalam neraka dan satu tempatnya di dalam surga yaitu
1018267 hendaknya kalian bersatu dan janganlah bercerai berai karena sesungguhnya syaitan itu bersama seorang dan dia dari dua orang lebih jauh barangsiapa menginginkan di tengah tengah surga maka hendaknya ia berjamaah bersatu
1018268 pada hari yang diwaktu itu ada muka yang putih berseri dan ada pula maka yang hitam muram
1018269 muka yang putih berseri adalah muka ahlus sunnah wal jamaah dan muka yang hitam muram adalah muka ahlil bidah dan furqah perselisihan
1018270 maka tatkala mereka membuat kami murka kami menghukum mereka lalu kami tenggelamkan mereka semuanya di laut dan kami jadikan mereka sebagai contoh dan pelajaran bagi orang orang yang kemudian
1018271 as salafush shalih lihat kamus bahasa arab taajul aruus lisaanul arab dan al qaamuusul muhuth bab salafa
1018272 dan barangsiapa yang menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa terhadap kesesesatan yang telah dikuasinya itu dan kami masukakan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
1018273 sebaik baik manusia adalah orang yang hidup pada masaku ini yaitu generasi sahabat kemudian yang sesudahnya generasi tabiin kemudian yang sesudahnya generasi tabiut tabiin
1018274 muhammad itu adalah utusan allah dan orang orang yang bersama dengan dia adalah keras terhadap orang orang kafir tetapi berkasih sayang sesama mereka kamu lihat mereka ruku dan sujud mencari karunia allah dan keridhaan nya tanda tanda mereka tampak pada muka mereka dari bekas sujud demikianlah sifat sifat mereka dalam taurat dan sifat sifat mereka dalam injil
1018275 dan barangsiapa mentaati allah dan rasul nya mereka itu akan bersama sama dengan orang orang yang dianugerahi nikmat oleh allah yaitu nabi nabi para shiddiqiin orang orang yang mati syahid dan orang orang shalih dan mereka itulah teman yang sebaik baiknya
1018276 barangsiapa mentaati rasul itu sesungguhnya ia telah mentaati allah dan barangsiapa berpaling dari ketaatan itu maka kami tidak mengutusmu untuk menjadi pemelihara bagi mereka
1018277 dan barangsiapa mendurhakai allah dan rasul nya dan melanggar ketentuan ketentuan nya niscaya allah memasukkannya ke dalam api neraka sedang ia kekal di dalamnya dan baginya siksa yang menghinakan
1018278 apa yang diberkan rasul kepadamu maka terimalah dia dan apa yang dilarangnya bagimu maka tinggalkanlah dan bertakwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah sangat keras hukuman nya
1018279 maka demi rabb mu mereka pada hakekatnya tidak beriman hingga mereka menjadikan kamu hakim dalam perakara yang mereka perselisihkan kemudian mereka tidak merasa keberatan dalam hati mereka terhadap putusan yang kamu berikan dan mereka menerima dengan sepenuhnya
1018280 sesungguhnya telah ada pada diri rasulullah itu suri teladan yang baik bagimu yaitu bagi orang orang yang mengharap rahmat allah dan kedatangan hari kiaman dan dia banyak menyebut allah
1018281 allah dan rasul nya itulah yang lebih patut mereka cari keridhaannya jika mereka adalah orang orang yang mukmin
1018282 katakanlah jika kamu benar benar mencintai allah ikutilah aku niscaya allah mengasihi dan mengampuni dosa dosamu allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
1018283 jika kamu berlainan pendapat tentang sesuatu maka kembalikanlah ia kepada allah al qur an dan rasul sunnahnya jika kamu benar benar beriman kepada allah dan hari kemudian yang demikian itu lebih utama bagimu dan lebih baik akibatnya
1018284 diantara orang orang mukmin itu ada orang orang yang menepati apa yang telah mereka janjikan kepada allah maka diantara mereka yang gugur dan diantara mereka ada pula yang menunggu nunggu dan mereka sedikitpun tidak merubah janjinya
1018285 sebaik baik manusia adalah orang yang hidup pada masaku ini yaitu generasi para sahabat kemudian yang sesudahnya generasi tabiin kemudian yang sesudahnya generasi tabiut tabiin
1018286 ummatku akan terpecah menjadi tujuh puluh tiga golongan semuanya di dalam neraka kecuali satu golongan
1018287 dan barang siapa menentang rasul sesudah jelas kebenaran baginya dan mengikuti jalan yang bukan jalan orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa terhadap kesesatan yang telah dikuasinya itu dan kami masukkan ia ke adalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali

1018298 wir gingen hin weil wir dort alles bekamen wir gingen hin wenn wir durst hatten versteht sich wenn wir hungrig waren oder hundem de wenn wir gl cklich waren gingen wir hin um zu feiern wenn wir traurig waren um tr bsal zu blasen nach hochzeiten und begr bnissen gingen wir hin um unsere nerven zu beruhigen und vorher um uns schnell mut anzutrinken wir gingen hin wenn wir nicht wussten was wir brauchten in der hoffnung jemand k nnte es uns sagen wir gingen hin wenn wir liebe suchten oder sex oder rger oder wenn jemand verschwunden war denn fr her oder sp ter tauchte dort jeder auf vor allem aber gingen wir hin um uns finden zu lassen

1018310 today is a winding road thats taking me to places that i didnt want to go i gotta find a way out maybe theres a way out
1018311 theres a part in everyday where i lie to myself and say that its okay
1018312 sen obama believes we need to change our trade focus from the bush years so there is a true focus on workers jobs farmers and on ensuring that we are lifting standards of living overseas
1018313 that is the focus that as president he would bring to seeking completion of a successful doha round
1018314 while obama would be skeptical of any agreement done by the bush administration especially in the last few months it would be premature to comment until there was an agreement and details to review
1018315 ill bet john motherfucking updike doesnt even know who i am
1018316 i dont think we can pass a law to prevent budweisers shareholders anheuser buschs shareholders from selling their company thats part of the free market system
1018317 i do think it would be a shame if bud is foreign owned i think we should be able to find an american company that is interested in purchasing anheuser busch if in fact anheuser busch feels that its necessary to sell
1018318 dont grow up too quickly lest you forget how much you love the beach
1018319 all firms will operate in the environment of an altered exchange rate irrespective of their export performance
1018320 the existence of the relationship of contingency between the subsidy and export performance must be inferred from the total configuration of the facts constituting and surrounding the granting of the subsidy none of which on its own is likely to be decisive in any given case
1018321 but anyone who understands comparative advantage knows that free trade affects relative prices not the price level the latter being the province of macro and monetary factors
1018322 a tax on imports is equivalent to a tax on exports

1018346 china has not even attempted to assert a defense aside from a vague reliance on article xx d to these plain breaches of its wto obligations
1018347 i appreciate and support the itc determination this is the first case in the history of u s trade agreement enforcement involving subsidies in china that has resulted in the imposition of countervailing duties by the u s department of commerce
1018348 a month ago the department of commerce determined that the actual rates of chinese dumping range from 69 to 85 percent and that the actual illegal subsidies range from 29 to 615 percent
1018349 the united states must always use the full range of multilateral and bilateral tools to insist that china and all other nations abide by the rules that govern the economic policies of nations our trade agreements must provide for fair competition and for fair treatment of american workers and then they must be fully enforced as congress intended them to operate
1018350 complying with naftas rules of origin can be cumbersome and costly
1018351 but from a pure economic you know if youre just an economist looking at this in an abstract way you would say well a more efficient producer displaced a less efficient producer in mexico theres nothing wrong with that as a practical matter those are millions of people in mexico who are displaced many of whom now are moving up to the united states contributing to the immigration concerns that people are feeling and so those human factors should be taken into account they may not override or every single decision that we make in respect to trade but to pretend those costs arent there that those costs arent real and my job as president to take those into account i think does no service to free trade and its part of what has fed the protection incentive and the anti immigration incentive that is out there in both parts and you know i think that if we manage trade more effectively if were better partners if we are thinking about the dislocations that occurs as a consequence of it if were true to our belief that labor and environmental standards should be a part of raising living standards around the world instead of a race to the bottom then we can have free trade and it will be sustainable and we will have political support over the long run
1018352 its beyond the realm of any real possibility that people are going to stomp away from the table and one of the countries is going to walk away from nafta
1018353 specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries
1018354 where the granting authority or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for and the amount of a subsidy specificity shall not exist provided that the eligibility is automatic and that such criteria and conditions are strictly adhered to the criteria or conditions must be clearly spelled out in law regulation or other official document so as to be capable of verification
1018355 if notwithstanding any appearance of non specificity resulting from the application of the principles laid down in subparagraphs a and b there are reasons to believe that the subsidy may in fact be specific other factors may be considered
1018356 for example a prize for a domestic company that could build a jumbo aircraft would pretty obviously be intended for certain enterprises
1018357 a government provides goods or services other than general infrastructure or purchases goods
1018358 t he provisions of this convention cannot in any way affect the right of the government of each country of the union to permit to control or to prohibit by legislation or regulation the circulation presentation or exhibition of any work or production in regard to which the competent authority may find it necessary to exercise that right
1018359 these principles ie art 8 and in particular its consistency requirement reflect the fact that the trips agreement does not generally provide for the grant of positive rights to exploit or use certain subject matter but rather provides for the grant of negative rights to prevent certain acts this fundamental feature of intellectual property protection inherently grants members freedom to pursue legitimate public policy objectives since many measures to attain those public policy objectives lie outside the scope of intellectual property rights and do not require an exception under the trips agreement
1018360 nothing in parts i to iv of this agreement shall derogate from existing obligations that members may have to each other under the paris convention the berne convention
1018361 but legally the copyright holder by relying on her his negative right would still be free to prevent such unauthorised exploitation only if censorship or other forms of control would interfere with this right to prevent one really has a case
1018362 works that are prohibited by law to be published or transmitted are not entitled to the protection accorded by this law
1018363 china makes a number of references to its right under the berne convention to conduct censorship reviews
1018364 in any way affect the right of the government of the party to permit to control or to prohibit by legislation or regulation the circulation presentation or exhibition of any work or production in regard to which the competent authority may find it necessary to exercise that right
1018365 provision shall be made to ensure the possibility that members may take joint action through adoption of suitable measures including through adoption of intergovernmental commodity agreements for stabilization of prices for exports of agricultural commodities at levels that are stable equitable and remunerative
1018366 action for negotiations and adoption of intergovernmental commodity agreements in pursuance of the provisions of the paragraph above may be taken either jointly by producing and consuming countries or by commodity dependent producing countries only
1018367 such agreements may provide for participation of association of producers
1018368 the general exceptions provisions of article xx h of gatt 1994 shall also apply to intergovernmental commodity agreements of which only producing countries of the concerned commodities are members

1018372 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
1018373 essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my osx 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomize the source port
1018374 it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few os x recursive servers in use

1018382 the criminally irresponsible failure of congress to execute these extensions that have broad bipartisan support is jeopardizing the industrys capacity to deliver and hit its cost targets
1018383 serving 33 percent of californias electricity needs with renewable sources will require an infrastructure build out on a scale and a timeline perhaps unparalleled in the world
1018384 its like this were building the car while we drive it and were trying to drive it very fast
1018385 the program is demonstrating that california has created a really vibrant market for renewable energy
1018386 theres a tendency to view the 2010 deadline as a litmus test for how well the programs working its important to set goals but in our view its far more important that we keep our eye on the ball which is reducing our dependence on fossil fuels

1018396 from a credit perspective the uk higher education sector has made positive strides over the past few years but faces increasing risks in the medium to long term
1018397 although we view universities in general as benefiting from strong government support individual universities may be allowed to fail particularly when there is insufficient student demand
1018398 instead any effect is more likely to be felt by the newer less research oriented universities
1018399 such universities may well need to look abroad for their recruitment and also diversify their offering to include more adult education and professional courses if they are to maintain current levels of activity
1018400 there has also been more intense pressure to spend on infrastructure which can be vital in recruiting top research staff from overseas competing for international students and coping with the rising expectations of home and eu students
1018401 given the upcoming demographic decline of 18 year olds and the effects of increased globalisation universities must judge whether their planned level of investment in staff and facilities is justified by the realistic prospect of higher revenues in the long term

1018426 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1018427 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1018428 kate and gerry are no longer arguidos formal suspects the portuguese judicial system has accepted that they were not involved in madeleines disappearance in any way shape or form and these files should be seen in that context
1018429 all that matters is the search for madeleine kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be
1018430 this exposes the rhetoric and reality of bts position on agency workers and makes a mockery of the fact that bt continue to state that they are not constraining the pay rates

1018432 we call on bt to revisit pay negotiations and commit to a pay rise for agency staff to back up the companys claims that agency workers are valued

1018439 as with all unsolved murders this case remains open and subject to review a 50 000 reward from the charity crimestoppers still remains available for information leading to the arrest and conviction of jills murderer
1018440 we continue to appeal for any new information and keep an open mind in relation to this case
1018441 this investigation has been subject to numerous reviews and assessments since 1999 by the mets internal review group the crown prosecution service criminal case review commission two senior independent treasury council and the court of appeal
1018442 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny of the available evidence to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case
1018443 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1018444 i will maintain that i will look anyone in the eye and state i have not killed jill dando

1018448 it is not an impossibility that something will turn up and given the high profile of the case peoples memory might be jogged and they could come forward with something new
1018449 why there are so many what are the causes of it
1018450 how can we correct it how can we support people who have been wrongly convicted none of that is discussed within the media its just simply left and because of that we dont learn from it

1018452 weve got loads of plans were going to support it massively content packs new objects new game modes all of this stuff could be done what were basically waiting to see is what the demand is for
1018453 we can do all of that stuff we will do all of that stuff but what order we do it in and how much weight we throw behind any of the different ideas that different people have got is totally down to what the community does

1018462 around 7 45pm a fire alarm went off inside the restaurant which received little notice by the restaurant staff by about 8 00pm a fire truck had arrived outside and when no one from the restaurant came outside to meet them a uniformed and oxygen tank equipped fire fighter walked through the front door seeking the fire or at least a manager to talk to when neither the host or bartender were able to point him in the right direction he finally reached a waiter who led him back into the kitchen stating that while there was no fire a vent had locked shut and steam built up in the kitchen setting off the alarm meanwhile business as usual was continuing out in the restaurant and neither the patrons nor the staff seemed to react to the fire alarm or presence of the fire department unfortunately that was short lived and the waitstaff was quickly notified that the fire department had shut down the kitchen until the vent could be opened fixed while an immediate call was made to the vent manufacturer all tables who had been seated and or ordered but had not received their entrees were notified that the kitchen was closed and could no longer prepare food the restaurant also halted seating tables and informed patrons waiting that the kitchen was closed indefinitely while the restaurant made no effort to notify parties that had not yet arrived or compensate parties which had not yet been seated they did offer an on the house selection of cold items to those that were seated but had not received entrees

1018485 dit wil niet zeggen dat studenten zelf meer sociaal verantwoordelijk zijn geworden maar ze geven er wel de voorkeur aan om producten te kopen van bedrijven die zich sociaal verantwoordelijk opstellen

1018487 nike wordt door vele studenten beschouwd als een positieve pijler van de gemeenschap

1018495 the quality of the candidates coming through the job boards alone was all over the map many didnt have the technology experience we needed you would think a recruiting firm would do a better job of sourcing its own talent but we didnt have a really well developed process for employer branding and vetting candidates
1018496 we were able to get a fully functional and professional employment portal up in just a few minutes with no technical knowledge needed it does a great job of portraying the companys culture and has attracted much higher quality candidates than we were previously able to find
1018497 its really obvious that they want to learn more about hcis business theyre better versed more web savvy more apt to do the things necessary to brand themselves better to us after seeing the professional level of the hci site when our offers are given people are more likely to accept standout jobs has helped us achieve an overall more polished brand and that makes a difference in the mind of the candidate when weighing offers
1018498 there is a lot of good work going on and aid continues to get through to cyclone hit areas especially from local organisations who are managing to help hundreds of thousands of people in extremely challenging circumstances
1018499 but it is now three months since the cyclone hit and it is widely accepted that many people have yet to receive any significant support the responsibility for this lies with the regime and the hurdles that it continues to place in front of aid agencies the regime must get fully behind the humanitarian aid effort and remove all barriers for agencies working on the ground

1018523 the bcia is at best a shadowy organization that exists as far as i can tell primarily to generate fees from the sale of bonds for donors to the bergen county democratic organization and to the bcdo attorney dennis oury who is also the attorney for the bcia

1018550 when we were children we had fresh bread every morning and before sunday school
1018551 so all the kids would come with us and have breakfast so she didnt have much but she was sharing everything she had
1018552 i used to go to farms and gather stuff up and put it up at my place
1018553 to keep me straight but do it in love we want to wish you another 103 years
1018554 the quaint rustic and natural setting felt at home for us and we knew it was where we wanted to be married as soon as we drove up to it
1018555 there is a lot of brokenness not only personally but also in the archdiocese
1018556 we pray for the healing of sex abuse victims and forgiveness for those who have done it and are part of it there are many other things that have to be healed as well the problem of the lack of charity violence in our families and our streets
1018557 everyone leaves with some kind of spiritual peace physical healing or spiritual healing
1018558 the idea of turning to the blessed mother in our time of need was instilled in me as a little boy as a regular thing to do
1018559 im not sure she is expectations are different the way of prayer is different you relate to the world differently as you get older you relate to god differently you relate to the saints differently your faith is hopefully more developed the experience of living with god and trying to conform to his will necessarily changes the way you pray
1018560 i had never really had a desire to go to lourdes
1018561 for me it was the opposite through christ i was pointed to mary
1018562 i became conscious that i was bearing her name and i had a responsibility to that
1018563 in a way that two women might share knowledge and companionship
1018564 there really is a genuine love for your fellow man those who are ill who travel there theyre the vips of the town everyone treats them like kings and queens as they should be that grace and love of god you feel theyre just being showered with it
1018565 be the biggest loss of my career to right now
1018566 it is a different burden for me i can tell you i have two careers most players dont have that experience you play here for the professional league the nba the best league in the world if you win titles in this league that would be wonderful
1018567 being in the olympics is a national honor its a dream i have when i am young it is obligation and an expectation that i have from my homeland the whole country is focused on these games in beijing basketball is a big game in china
1018568 i would say i am about 60 to 70 percent and that is frustrating i am sure now that i will play in the olympics
1018569 but i wont be in my best shape i know that and that is disappointing
1018570 this is about different cultures different backgrounds and bringing all people different ways of thinking about things
1018571 i cant say that any side is wrong americans say the rockets pay my salary no problem i like the rockets whatever uniform i wear i play 100 percent
1018572 for china they have to understand that my loyalty to my country will never change but now i have another group of people in america that i need to take care of these people the chinese fans and american fans are not connected they do not understand how each other think i am the one who is connected i am in the middle that is the important goal of the olympics to bring different people together
1018573 obviously a medal is always a dream when youre playing in the olympics
1018574 youre standing there and you have a medal it doesnt matter what color you have but to be honest we are not at that level yet especially with the injuries to me and to yi jianlian i am not sure of our fitness we can make some history if we get into the 7th or 6th spot but i think 8th is about where we are
1018575 if we win that first game i would quit right away i would say im getting out of here im not playing basketball anymore if we beat usa in game 1 that would be the top i can do no more
1018576 i was a very young player and got my first taste of the olympics in 2000 at sydney i played in athens in 2004 and now this is my home country and the highest special honor in 2008 enough i think why would i need to play in london in 2012
1018577 my parents do not talk about this but it is a story i have heard from people who are friends of my parents
1018578 when my mom lost her chance to play in the olympics instead she had me that year if she had played in the olympics i would probably be two years younger now or maybe not born at all
1018579 the first time i really watched the olympics and understood was 1996 in atlanta at that time i was practicing with the shanghai sharks junior team i remember waking up at 3 a m to watch china play argentina on tv we won that game and my parents told me it was a big big event wang zhi zhi played in that game and played well at that time i thought one day i could play in the olympics
1018580 when you have the flag in your hand you feel like you have a whole country of people in your grasp and of course you feel the expectation it is the pressure that i have continued to feel every day since i came to the nba and now going back home for the olympics it is such extreme focus
1018581 a lot of the people who were living there and all across china were so excited earlier this year about the olympics now 2008 has brought this to us first as the year passes it is difficult to forget we cannot forget we cannot just celebrate games and the olympics when we still have this suffering from the earthquake
1018582 in the last several years ive worked with the china youth development foundation
1018583 they are focused on building schools for kids in poor areas giving out scholarships last summer we had a successful
1018584 at that time besides the money we raised i began thinking that it would be a very good idea to have my own foundation the original plan was to wait until after the olympics to announce it and get it started i would have more time then but the earthquake hit i watched the news i felt so sad i felt helpless in a way and i knew i had to do something right away i can do something to help
1018585 there are a lot of different ways to think about things there are republicans and democrats in america there are different parties everywhere many different ideas
1018586 but if you are not going then you lost a chance to tell people what you think and we have lost a chance to communicate with you
1018587 i think back to when they started the modern olympics in athens in 1896 it was a beautiful idea to put people together again to make friendship and share the honor and share everything
1018588 they stopped wars for the olympics they laid down their arms for the games right now war looks like a part of our life in this world but hopefully no wars no bombs no gunshots in those three weeks of the olympics maybe it is a dream it is my wish
1018589 some fear that mr obamas focus on the socioeconomic status of his daughters as opposed to the diversity of experience and perspective they might bring to predominantly white campuses may help conservatives in their battle to eliminate race from university admissions and government hiring
1018590 we are gratified that senator mccain has endorsed the principles of the education equality project joining education civil rights and elected officials across america who are working together to bring meaningful reform to our nations public schools
1018591 fixing our schools wont be easy and it will require strong national leadership but nothing short of that will enable us to live up to our basic commitment to our children to help them learn so they have a real shot at achieving the american dream education reform like civil rights is above partisan politics and must be embraced by all
1018592 illinois has been plagued with testing problems since 2002 when no child left behind required states to ramp up testing
1018593 in every year except 2005 testing data has been riddled with errors seriously delayed or contained sizable shifts
1018594 i shall divorce you because you are said to be blind in one eye
1018595 have you just discovered that after 20 years of marriage
1018596 was your mother at one time in service at the palace
1018597 ive had a great loss just when he had learned not to eat he died
1018598 mr sisti i cant get the clay off this mold
1018599 why dont you get a rag and a bucket of soapy water
1018600 then just use a lot of elbow grease to clean it off
1018601 i was not certain if the whole world i had fallen into was upside down and i was right side up or vice versa
1018602 what happened to you you used to be such a jovial little kid
1018603 i thought he didnt like to be called pacman any more you said pacman pacman jones
1018604 i thought he didnt want to be called pacman any more
1018605 lord did i make a decision too fast with the right information and checking it with you first
1018606 you want to give em just enough to hook em

1018613 iwas once so connected with a female human body that we shared the same blood the same oxygen the same food if it weren t for that woman i would not exist look here is the evidence
1018614 what makes a man a man a friend of mine once wondered
1018615 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
1018616 everyone is used to seeing athletes in competition or winning but we wanted to give people the chance to see the real make up of an athlete and their muscle and power
1018617 definitely one of the more unusual shoots ive taken part in but also one of the most enjoyable
1018618 centrica confirms that it is in discussions with a third party with a view to centrica taking a minority ownership position in british energy subject to various conditions including this third party successfully acquiring british energy
1018619 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1018620 these alternatives may include a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and if all parties are fully supportive

1018622 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1018623 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1018624 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the
1018625 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1018626 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season
1018627 the suspect slaughtered their dog and threw it out of their home and onto the street and proceeded to kill the woman totally severing her head
1018628 the attacker walked around the village carrying the head of the victim in one hand and the cleaver in the other
1018629 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1018630 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some time getting used to someone else being in charge
1018631 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to
1018632 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1018633 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1018634 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1018635 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1018636 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1018637 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him
1018638 hes an excellent batter and demands respect with his batting hes also not shy of making the big decisions those big decisions are not going to affect that style of guy
1018639 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1018640 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1018641 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
1018642 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1018643 in the emerging markets where hsbc is the leading international bank growth remained strong in the period as real asset prices continued to rise and infrastructure development continued to boost economic growth which supported consumer confidence and spending

1018650 obama ad we cant afford another president in big oils pocket
1018651 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1018652 the answer to the problem of americas dependence on foreign oil is to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and i think that can only be done by having a were going to get to the moon approach to renewable energy
1018653 graham and daschle in heated debate over the race card with videos
1018654 look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1018655 john mccain doesnt have a racist bone in his body
1018656 and theres no doubt in my mind that what senator obama is trying to suggest that hes a victim of something
1018657 he is living off celebrity not ideas and one of the campaign issues is credibility
1018658 to say that barack obama did not intentionally inject the idea that he was going to be a victim of his name and his race is a lie
1018659 theres been a lot of recycling programs where you can mail back goods
1018660 but nobodys going to mail back a television most of them are way too big
1018661 because they lg dont even have a drop off site in every state although they say they will by september and the same with sony its modest as far as how many places are available for take backs but theyve clearly stated an intent to grow the number and make it easy for people to find nearby locations
1018662 tell us that they will be managing the take backs in a responsible way
1018663 are driving people to get rid of their older units even if they work
1018664 even though there are a number of toxic materials in conventional tvs and computer monitors in a lot of states its not illegal to toss them in the trash
1018665 its time manufacturers start to internalize the cost of recycling of their products
1018666 you lose one half of the photons every 15 kilometers
1018667 if you sent a single photon if its lost theres nothing left to amplify
1018668 we put entanglement into matter and then read it out
1018669 aside from the summary for policymakers which is very terse there doesnt exist any vehicle for taking all of the vital information in this lengthy and sometimes very technical set of reports and boiling it down for popular consumption
1018670 we wanted to translate the ipcc package in a way that a person on the street without a technical background could really understand the issues involved
1018671 we came up with concepts we wanted to explain to a lay audience
1018672 such as fingerprint detection how we can look at patterns of temperature change during the 20 th century not just the fact that temperatures are warming but the spatial pattern of warming that points to the source of that warming
1018673 we might not be able to tell one from the other if all we had were surface observations but thats not all we have
1018674 instead what were finding is a warming in the troposphere the lower part of the atmosphere that we live in but a cooling as you move up into the lower stratosphere where jets fly and that cooling aloft
1018675 is a unique signature of a warming due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations
1018676 obviously there is some overlap between al gores book and ours
1018677 but gores book wasnt written by scientists and it reads like it wasnt while i do think an inconvenient truth was wonderful
1018678 we do think this climate dilemma is something that we can solve
1018679 alex conant a spokesman for the republican national committee said michigan republicans planned to go to obamas lansing event to pass out tire gauges engraved with obamas energy plan that pokes fun at the part of obamas energy plan calling for people to inflate their tires to the highest correct pressure to help conserve fuel
1018680 getting our financing all in line it takes some time to do that because of the detail associated with the project
1018681 now we have finally touched and tasted ice on mars
1018682 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
1018683 many of the animal speeds given in encyclopedias et cetera are little better than guesses
1018684 do not be impressed by popular books that compare a fleas 30 centimeter jump to a man jumping over st pauls cathedral
1018685 theory tells us that jump height should not fall in proportion to body size as animals get smaller fleas are actually rather poor jumpers
1018686 i have told my zoology class that we should put a speedo logo on the side of an albacore in the olympics and have it race
1018687 im amazed at how pathetic human swimmers are compared to other animals
1018688 i dont think you could keep them in the lanes
1018689 some people say its a tombstone others say its not the cause
1018690 the role of a beta is still very very controversial
1018691 if on top of tangles you add plaques or increase a beta now you have massive neurodegeneration
1018692 as people get older and older pin1 levels drop drop drop
1018693 if tdp 43 is the major pathway then sod1 was misdirecting us
1018694 you dont make a lot of protein and stack it up so therefore you dont have the same rigorous protein turnover mechanisms

1018701 drilling is out of the question because cheaper oil is not worth the possibility of damaging our precious landscapes or wildlife and we need to cut fossil fuel use because of global warming and high gas prices are the best thing to make that happen
1018702 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
1018703 but the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
1018704 but lets say that is true what good is wind or solar going to be in that time frame to power cars you could say electric cars but not in this time frame you cannot replace the hundreds of millions of gas powered cars in the u s within this time frame can you explain what is going to happen to the batteries from the hundreds of millions of cars when they wear out
1018705 replacing hundreds of millions of gas power cars within this time frame
1018706 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
1018707 do you think oil companies would sell oil to us consumers for one cent less than they could get from french consumers no where oil comes from has no effect on price
1018708 then there are the distribution concerns and as youve mentioned battery concerns as it is well known that these batteries are every bit as bad for the environment as our other resources
1018709 if something like bush lifting the ban on offshore drilling can cause oil to plummet by 16 barrel just think what 3 5 million new barrels onto the market would do
1018710 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
1018711 then you say in 30 years gas will be 12 a gallon if this drilling will not effect the price of oil dont you think gas will not increase more than 2 a gallon over a 15 20 year period
1018712 as for car batteries let me clear up my statement i was talking about the batteries that will be in electric cars have you thought about how to dispose of those
1018713 as for you so called correction about transmission lines going to the
1018714 does it not matter to you that gas produced in america will keep the u
1018715 every barrel of anwr oil production reduces crude oil imports by about a barrel
1018716 looks like the dems would rather go on a five week vacation than debate what to do about the price of gas
1018717 new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have as little effect as 41 cents per barrel and would have its largest impact nearly 20 years from now if congress voted to open the refuge today
1018718 i assume this would also be true for ocs oil
1018719 reduction of dependence on foreign oil and concerns over prices
1018720 i do believe that the rise in cost is primarily due to futures speculation and much less to do with supply demand
1018721 this pov has actually nothing to do with e mc2 and pre supposes that humans the american variety in this case cannot adapt to changing economic conditions
1018722 what im saying here is that the political argument that the path to us energy independence is primarily through the reduction of us dependence on
1018723 the united states more than anyone has the technology money and ability to embrace energy conservation renewable resources and alternative energy technologies
1018724 i do believe that the rise in cost is primarily due to futures speculation and much less to do with supply demand
1018725 this pov has actually nothing to do with e mc2 and pre supposes that humans the american variety in this case cannot adapt to changing economic conditions
1018726 what im saying here is that the political argument that the path to us energy independence is primarily through the reduction of us dependence on

1018728 definitely as we were all fit though in these days with video cameras jimmyd be out for a year and rhys jones for 2
1018729 the current countermeasure to this dns cache poisoning vulnerability is to introduce increased entropy by forcing randomization of the query id and the source port
1018730 essentially making it all the more difficult to spoof the dns response however it appears that apple forgot something the client libraries on my osx 10 4 11 system post patch install still does not randomize the source port
1018731 it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few os x recursive servers in use
1018732 the bottom line is that despite this update it appears that the client libraries still arent patched

1018734 the key finding here is that this is ascorbic acid used as a drug and it appears to have some promise in treating some cancers
1018735 that hydrogen peroxide leads to death of some cancer cells and does not seem to kill normal cells why that is we dont know
1018736 the thing thats realistic here is that the concentrations that are effective or similar concentrations can be achieved in humans
1018737 i think were pretty close to being ready to do that

1018740 because of the iraq war i think that mcdermott is pretty solidly in place
1018741 ive watched people who are very interested take themselves out of the running as time goes on as we all get older
1018742 that would be the most likely scenario if theres going to be change in that seat in the future
1018743 omg documentaries are like so totally dull those are for

1018748 although some parents dislike the idea of video games in libraries the columbus metropolitan library has spent 40 000 on video game equipment in the first two years of a program to make teenagers feel more welcome in libraries

1018798 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
1018799 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
1018800 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
1018801 senator obama has looked at this issue he recognizes that americans are suffering that we have a unique situation with rising gas prices and this is one occasion where we really need to look at this strategically and he made the decision that we do need to tap the strategic petroleum reserves
1018802 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point
1018803 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency

1018812 as a business that works to build our communitys consciousness of our environment and how our everyday choices affect the earth we are very excited that governor lynch sees the positive impact we can make by promoting nhs local food choices
1018813 there are so many benefits to eating local from lowering gas consumption associated with shipping food long distances and thus reducing our carbon footprint to supporting and strengthening the local economy its hard to argue with the notion of at least trying to incorporate local goods in our diets
1018814 you will notice improved freshness and flavor when your food takes less steps to get from the farm to the table food that is just picked simply tastes better and often requires less complicated preparation because of flavor intensity which in turn saves you time the seasonality of local foods offers buyers the best flavors at the best times naturally supporting local agriculture also promotes more selection like tons of varieties of heirloom tomatoes youd never see in the grocery store and as an added bonus it can reduce the likelihood of sprawl because it helps to keep family farms alive and land in a productive agricultural state most importantly though i believe it helps to create a broader sense of community when you know the people who grow and prepare your foods

1018838 i would like him to say to the chinese leaders that these meetings of unregistered or independent churches and believers they are not a threat to the society even the chinese government ruling because they have been praying
1018839 i also would like him to tell the chinese people the american people stand in solidarity with the freedom fighters of china and they wont be ignored
1018840 t hese types of messages will really encourage hundreds of thousands
1018841 he could make a good impact for china to be opening more
1018842 the last thing i want to see is he would cave in to the chinese government and business interests and lobbyists in the united states by keeping silent
1018843 but im more hopeful now after meeting with him in person and the past few days the white house has been more vocal on these issues instead of what they have been the last few months
1018844 we condone or accept or will allow frankly as a leader in the world things on the ground in china to continue as they are because human rights individual freedom freedom of religion freedom of the press frankly are still non existent in a country that wants to convince the world that they have reformed
1018845 well i hope mr president that when you go that you will use the bully pulpit of the white house in a very influential way to try to let the leadership of china know that just because were participating and just because youre there for the opening ceremonies in no way means that we condone or accept or will allow frankly as a leader in the world things on the ground in china to continue as they are because human rights individual freedom freedom of religion freedom of the press frankly are still non existent in a country that wants to convince the world that they have reformed

1018848 in an atmosphere that honors the olympic traditions of freedom and openness
1018849 tragically but predictably the olympics have been the occasion of a massive crackdown designed to silence and put beyond reach all those chinese whose views differ from the government line
1018850 for so many brave chinese men and women for the tibetans many of them buddhist monks and nuns for members of falun gong chinese christians uighur muslims democracy and labor activists and others this has been a terrible summer not in spite of but precisely because of the olympic games
1018851 he told the activists that engagement with chinese leaders gives him an opportunity to make the united states position clear human rights and religious freedom should not be denied to anyone
1018852 the olympics are another opportunity to tell china that it has obligations not to imprison or torture its religious people its religious leaders
1018853 so we need to speak out and we need to be clear about it we should use whatever leverage remains to us in the olympics to do so
1018854 by arranging such a meeting between its leader and these people and making irresponsible remarks on chinas human rights and religious situation the u s side has rudely interfered in chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to the anti china hostile forces
1018855 this action itself is a blasphemy to the spirit of the olympics and runs counter to the aspiration of people of all countries including the u s

1018860 manufacturing confidence has tumbled over the past quarter the climb in oil and other raw material prices over recent months has driven costs up significantly although firms are having some success in passing these costs on profit margins are under pressure

1018866 so having precipitated the fall of wrapit hsbc now have it within their power to minimise the pain caused to 2 000 couples and probably 100 000 of their guests and ensure that no wrapit customer loses any money and as things stand they will not take it

1018912 between budget deficits and using one time money to pay for ongoing needs next year our state is going to start almost 200 million in the hole and thats a best case scenario at this point this once again highlights the importance of making tough choices while times are good so that we wont face cuts to some of governments most critical functions when revenues arent coming in at record levels the bottom line is that you cant grow government by 40 percent over three years without it catching up with you at some point and this bill is a reminder that freewheeling spending of the past few years has indeed caught up with us

1019121 with school holidays in full swing we want to warn families to be aware of the dangers of tunnelling in sand
1019122 wet sand as we have had today after rain makes it easier for tunnelling but sand is always very unstable and heavy and can collapse at any time
1019123 when we got to the area his friends had uncovered his head then we concentrated on uncovering his torso
1019124 we felt the problem was the weight of sand on his body and all our efforts went into getting the sand away from his chest area
1019125 the family were shouting at him to help himself believing that he was conscious and able to help us
1019126 there must have been two tonnes of sand on top of him
1019127 we didnt know which way his body was lying behind him or in front
1019128 he and his friends must have spent the best part of the day to have dug two deep holes and a tunnel connecting them
1019129 the sand would have been wet and firm to begin with but once the tunnel was dug air would have got in and dried it out and thats why it collapsed
1019130 they were pretty hysterical there was a lot of crying and a lot of screaming
1019131 the family were saying help yourself help them get you out
1019132 im 60 now and 40 years ago was the last time this happened and that was a good four miles away but it was a similar type of sand
1019133 for all we know perhaps people are digging tunnels here all the time
1019134 its only when a tragedy happens that you find out about it
1019135 the message has to be its safe to come here the dunes are beautiful just dont dig holes here
1019136 this relationship is completely in line with our goals as a company we established a corporate social responsibility platform that addressed workers rights environmental impact and philanthropy it is only natural that part of our marketing efforts go towards sponsoring socially and environmentally responsible programs like green living project

1019138 in addition we have been very impressed with their energy and enthusiasm for making la sportiva a more sustainable and environmentally responsible company in this day and age it is so important for all companies to analyze their total impact on the environment in order to see what steps can be made to be more responsible la sportiva is doing just that and we have been impressed
1019139 but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1019140 we made a decision to have a big family and support each other to make it work

1019156 this wasnt the quaintly ethnic westernized row of dim sum restaurants and fortune cookie take out dives that characterized the touristy zigzag of streets bordering the financial district on one side the theater district on the other
1019157 we believe that creating beautifully designed public spaces at the centre of six of pennine lancashires towns will set the stage for new dramas to unfold and new stories to be told
1019158 within a decade we want to see art landscape and architecture students and professionals from across the globe descending on pennine lancashire to study world class examples of public space design
1019159 the pennine lancashire squared competition aims to inspire public pride improve perceptions and increase private investment in our town centres in a way which reflects their character but also looks to the future
1019160 the nwda is pleased to support an initiative which will bring high quality design in to the heart of six pennine lancashire towns and will help to secure their economic regeneration
1019161 the regenerative qualities of considered public realm are well known we are seeking truly inspirational designs of international quality for each of pennine lancashires towns that will reanimate enrich communities engender civic pride and ownership and be a lasting vision
1019162 this is an opportunity for our towns to match our surroundings and to give our citizens open spaces in town centres that will be used frequently it will enhance cohesion and engender a sense of pride in our public realm
1019163 the show home cruise was good because you didnt have the hassle of traffic parking or directions you also got to see more properties in one day
1019164 the teams were very friendly and helpful all the people weve met have been great
1019165 we were really pleased to be able to show so many people our homes on saturday the show home cruise included nine of our developments across east london including homes offering canalside views in stepney and apartments with a residents gym on the edge of the olympic park
1019166 it enabled us to show people a wide range of quality affordable homes while offering information on different buying options anyone can find out more about our homes by calling 0845 6000830 or dropping into our head office on west ham lane stratford
1019167 the view of pedlars as harmless rogue del boy types is long gone
1019168 pedlars can be here today but gone tomorrow which makes it hard to stop them from selling faulty or unsafe products while consumers have little chance of getting their money back for substandard goods
1019169 their products are often poor in quality and even dangerous councils report that they operate in packs sometimes linked to local criminal gangs obstructing passers by and using intimidating and threatening behaviour
1019170 like any traders there are good and bad pedlars however the rules that govern the way they operate are out of step with consumer protection law generally and in desperate need of updating
1019171 prosecution of pedlars caught breaking the existing law can be costly and difficult while the fines are often paltry
1019172 councils are reporting that this is a problem across the country so much so that a number of local authorities are seeking their own private bills from parliament to change the way pedlars are regulated
1019173 the scale of this problem is such that there must be new national legislation to give councils in all areas the power to regulate pedlars properly rather than relying on councils promoting numerous local bills
1019174 the lga is calling on the government to reform the law through national legislation to protect the public and small businesses across the country
1019175 helping adults commit and stay committed not only opens the door to a depth of emotional enrichment which a series of shallow and hedonistic encounters can never generate it also provides the best possible start in life for children
1019176 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1019177 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1019178 the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women
1019179 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude
1019180 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
1019181 we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing
1019182 the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest
1019183 there is nothing in what this government is doing to show it understands how to respect devolved government that it appreciates the need for local government to go its own way that it comprehends how its policies are reducing social capital that it realises how the loss of local services weaken community relationships or that it even begins to appreciate how the demands of the centralised bureaucracy are eroding the civic the local and the voluntary
1019184 and thats because i fear for gordon brown there really is no such thing as society only the individual and the state
1019185 the sad truth is that if you are eligible for free school meals youre almost 200 times more likely to leave school without a single gcse pass than you are to get three as at a level
1019186 but i do believe that we need to ensure that with a culture which encourages facilitates and celebrates success theres also a parallel culture of responsibility reciprocity and respect
1019187 of those to whom much is given much is expected
1019188 michael gove really has to be careful not to denigrate the high quality of education in englands schools in order to make his arguments
1019189 schools are tired of being described as failing by politicians who simply want to create clear water between themselves and other parties
1019190 while he is right to highlight the vital need for good local schools his proposals to increase choice and diversity of schools is diametrically opposed to that idea
1019191 his proposals to increase choice and diversity and introduce a form of quasi voucher will undermine the social capital that he argues for and increase social segregation
1019192 all the international evidence he refers to points to the damaging effect of choice and diversity on the efforts of countries to meet all childrens needs
1019193 michael gove raises deep and complex social issues which reach far wider than simply reading a magazine to try to create an unsubstantiated causal link between these issues and mens magazines is unrealistic
1019194 the shadow secretarys declared commitment to families is welcome but it is difficult to see how family life and responsible parenting would be strengthened by work requirements for single parents of young children as proposed by the party or how child poverty would be addressed by tax breaks for married parents only
1019195 most single parents have been married and expected their families to stay intact
1019196 unfortunately attempts to encourage people to stay together through the tax system have a history of failure tax allowances for married couples existed throughout the 1970s and 80s which saw a rapid rise in divorce rates
1019197 it is important that the issues highlighted in todays speech are brought to peoples attention
1019198 however the conservative party are missing a trick if they dont pay attention to why there is a rise in family breakdown and feckless fatherhood
1019199 in our experience there is no one reason that leads to this but by offering targeted support at an early stage to vulnerable families and young dads solutions can be reached

1019252 however we see a lot of association between asthma and acid reflux in the 15 million americans who have asthma as many as 50 to 80 percent also have acid reflux
1019253 we do know that reflux can cause asthma if the reflux is aspirated into the lungs or the acid in the esophagus can cause chest tightness also if acid gets into the bottom of the esophagus it can reflux up against the bronchial nerve which causes the airways to narrow and a shortness of breath
1019254 my patients will say oh that tightness in the middle of my chest isnt there anymore
1019255 when a patient thinks of reflux they think of heartburn or regurgitation and they arent aware of the other atypical signs
1019256 its not uncommon anymore to get referrals from allergists and pulmonologists
1019257 sometimes surgery is needed to tighten up the esophageal sphincter which prevents the reflux of acid
1019258 this is the first experimental evidence in a controlled laboratory setting linking these two very common conditions in humans
1019259 these data suggest that chronic micro aspiration of gastric fluid can drive the immune system toward an asthmatic response
1019260 this does not mean that everyone with gerd is going to develop asthma by any means
1019261 but it may mean that people with gerd may be more likely to develop asthma if there is an upside to this it is that developing gerd is something we can pretty much treat and control

1019562 o son of the prophet s a w w what is your opinion about the deeds of a man does he do them by himself or does allah make him do them
1019563 the doings of a man are confined to three possibilities that allah alone does them while the man is quite helpless that both allah and the man equally share the commitment that the man does them alone now if the first assumption is true it obviously proves the injustice of allah who punishes his creatures for sins which they have not committed if the second condition be accepted even then allah is unjust if he punishes a man for sins in which he is equally a partner but the undesirability of both these conditions is evident in the case of allah thus we are naturally left with the third alternative to the problem that men are absolutely responsible for their actions

1019909 man sagt immer dass sich gl ck und pech im verlaufe einer saison ausgleichen
1019910 aber ich glaube ich hatte schon mehr als genug pech in der gp2 asia lief alles blendend vielleicht gleicht es sich damit aus ich wollte seit langer zeit eine pole position holen und nachdem ich das ausgerechnet auf dieser strecke schaffte wo man kaum berholen kann sahen die dinge richtig gut aus
1019911 ich hatte einen schlechten start vielleicht verlor der reifen zu diesem zeitpunkt bereits luft ich habe versucht in kurve zwei an senna vorbei zu ziehen aber ich hatte keinen grip und keine stabilit t ich wollte das auto dann bis zum boxenstopp fenster ber die runden retten aber ich verlor pro umlauf zw lf sekunden und die luft ging immer weiter weg
1019912 am sonntag fuhr ich voll auf angriff ich wollte zeigen dass man sogar in ungarn berholen kann ich habe zwar einige fehler gemacht aber es immerhin in die top 12 geschafft wir waren die schnellsten aber mathematisch gesehen war es extrem negativ
1019913 w ren wir vorne gewesen h tte es anders ausgesehen
1019914 wenn wir vorne gewesen w ren h tte es wahrscheinlich anders ausgesehen in ungarn haben sie aber wirklich ihren starken speed gezeigt wir wussten vorher dass sie den haben nur die medien denken es g be da einen gro en unterschied
1019915 ich habe keine fehler gemacht ich hatte eben nur einen reifenschaden ich habe das auto ganz vorsichtig zur ck gebracht und habe so viele punkte wie m glich geholt mehr konnte man nicht erwarten
1019916 es war einfach pech dass ich derjenige war der den platzer hatte es war so ein fall von oh nein nicht schon wieder mir ist im vergangenen jahr drei mal so etwas passiert das hat mich letztlich die meisterschaft gekostet
1019917 ich kann aber noch dankbar sein denn kimi hat nicht gewonnen es hilft nat rlich dass heikki gewonnen hat und timo zweiter wurde damit haben sie den anderen punkte weggeschnappt daher bin ich gl cklich
1019918 meine f hrung ist angewachsen das h tte doch niemand erwartet bei all den dingen die uns dieses jahr schon passiert sind
1019919 es ist noch ein langer weg ich muss sicherstellen dass ich k rperlich auch gut auf den rest der saison vorbereitet bin
1019920 ein renncockpit w re f r das lernen viel wertvoller
1019921 ich muss rennsituationen lernen qualifyings die dinge die man beim testen nicht lernen kann es ist leicht eine schnelle runde hinzuknallen aber sehr schwierig das in einem qualifying zu schaffen daher hoffe ich dass ich ein renncockpit angeboten bekomme wenn ich hier einen guten job mache
1019922 wenn mir ein sehr gutes team einen testvertrag f r ein jahr und einen rennvertrag f r das n chste anbietet dann ist das eine gute perspektive grunds tzlich w re mir aber gleich ein rennvertrag lieber
1019923 f r mich war die strecke und das auto ja v lliges neuland umso beeindruckter waren die japaner daher als ich nach wenigen eingew hnungsrunden schon schnell unterwegs war
1019924 ich habe mich sofort sehr wohl im lexus sc430 gef hlt die rennwagen der super gt sind extrem gut vorbereitet die auf diesem fahrzeug verwendeten yokohama reifen haben zudem extrem viel grip

1019996 n s ainda estamos fazendo a montagem do filme pegando os efeitos da ilm e depois iremos mostr lo para a alta c pula da paramount provavelmente no final de agosto estamos realmente realmente animados sobre o que conseguimos acho que o filme realmente funciona ent o creio que iremos apenas p r as cenas de efeitos especiais agora isso uma das coisas que nos faz manter a programa o de deixar o filme pronto no natal de modo que n s iremos nos sentar sobre isso por enquanto
