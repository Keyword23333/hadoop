7820033 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7820034 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications

7820061 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7820069 we sri lankan americans love our motherland congressman please help our motherland to move on devoid of terrorism
7820070 this is what happened on august 23 2008 when california congressman brad sherman well known for his pro ltte stance held a public meeting at reseda high school for constituents of his 27th district
7820071 a large crowd of concerned sri lankan expatriates including the buddhist clergy were gathered at the location from 1 pm onwards carrying placards
7820072 the congressman had of course stealthily moved to the hall avoiding confrontation with the protestors assembled at the main gate
7820073 the vociferous commotion led to continuous police attention there was however no police action as the protest was conducted lawfully and peacefully
7820074 some protesters noting the congressmans presence at the auditorium began moving in there
7820075 the sri lankan group that moved into the auditorium without carrying placards were occupying front seats and looking for an opportunity to voice their case the initial opportunity dawned when a written question on the sri lankan terrorist issue was taken up for discussion by the congressman
7820076 bypassing the issue of receiving ltte funds he went on saying
7820077 a petition signed by protesters demanding the congressmans resignation from the u
7820078 we sri lankan americans love our motherland congressman please help our motherland to move on devoid of terrorism
7820079 reading the placard implicating the congressman having accepted campaign funds from a terrorist group sherman stated
7820080 an exchange ensued when the congressman was disputing the issue
7820081 yes there is proof that you have accepted donations from the ltte
7820082 do you accept that the ltte is a terrorist organization

7820110 ok your car in heaven is that used geo metro over there goodbye
7820111 i must admit that in 15 years of marriage i did cheat on my wife 3 times
7820112 and you how many times did you cheat on your wife
7820113 i am proud to say that over 20 years of marriage i never cheated on my wife in fact my beloved has been dead for 2 years now and i remained celibate the whole time
7820114 very impressive your car in heaven is that ferrari convertible goodbye
7820115 hey whatsamatterwidyou we should be crying were stuck with these ugly buckets and you got a new ferrari
7820116 det g r fram t f r sverige men vilka l mnas efter i tjugo r har janne josefsson skildrat samh llet i svt vilken bild r det som vuxit fram
7820117 i went by the art show you told me about
7820118 it was a good show who wouldve thought that psychologists make art
7820119 the problem ive got is because im using him ive not been training him to a level where i would consider it to be pre season training
7820120 after every game that he has played he has had a little muscle niggle one or the other and thats because he just hasnt trained
7820121 so what im trying to do two things at once get him some time on the field get him up to speed in training if we can and then you will see him starting games
7820122 that will help him hes getting better you can see it in training and it wont be too long im pretty sure of it
7820123 we had a point to prove our record in inverness spoke for itself with no goals in five games
7820124 it is not good enough for a club of our size and the manager said before we went up to inverness we had to put the record to the back of our minds and take three points
7820125 unfortunately we could not do that but i think we gave a good account of ourselves the feeling in the dressing room is that we should have won the game
7820126 there were five or six players who had chances and only colin nish took one
7820127 he had a couple more as well as did i steven fletcher and dean shiels you could go through a number of us who had chances
7820128 we will need to work on our finishing and one day we will take all our chances
7820129 steve played in them last year while pedro is experienced enough hes a european cup winner and nothing will faze him
7820130 you could see from pedros touches against aberdeen and his class on the ball that he is brilliant and can really help us next week
7820131 we can just give him the ball and let him calm the game down
7820132 madjid will also make a debut but he played for a big club at charlton so i have no worries about him coping with it
7820133 you could say it was an injustice but there is nothing we can do about it now
7820134 we only went down the road with a point and i think if i am being honest we deserved more over the 90 minutes
7820135 la ritorsione intesa a modo mio consiste nel ribattere alla stupidit il pi presto possibile con un segno di intelligenza forse lunico modo di rifarsi qual la massima esperienza che potete vivere lora del grande disprezzo lora nella quale anche la vostra gioia diventa uno schifo cos la vostra ragione e la vostra virt lora nella quale voi dite che me ne importa della mia felicit e una cosa povera e sporca un misero conforto proprio la mia felicit dovrebbe da sola bastare a giustificare lesistenza lora nella quale voi dite che me ne importa della mia ragione forse avete fame di sapienza come il leone ha fame del suo cibo ma non che cosa povera e sporca un misero conforto lora nella quale voi dite che me ne importa della mia virt essa non riuscita ancora a farmi impazzire come sono stanco del mio bene e del mio male tutto ci non che povero e sporco e misero conforto

7820162 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7820163 one of the first things we did was to notify all officers in our department of the situation
7820164 we are aware of it and we are addressing it
7820165 cbp is on heightened alert ever since we became aware of the threats in mexico
7820166 we are closely monitoring these developments and will act accordingly to protect the integrity of the border
7820167 we are always in the business of analyzing this type of information
7820168 its further evidence of the blatant just the audacity of these cartels
7820169 youve got three cartels in juarez with a fight between the gulf and the sinaloa cartels along with the juarez cartel so that might have contributed to pushing some people across the border
7820170 theres extreme violence from both sides lots of money and lots of weapons
7820171 the immediate danger is that innocent people will get caught up in it

7820177 one of the assumptions that people make is that if they buy virus protecting software that will protect them from all known viruses
7820178 that may well be true but theres an awful lot out there that we dont know about
7820179 so designing more effective systems and designing security models to ensure that we dont have these problems is what the course is based around
7820180 in the industry we refer to people with white hats and black hats which comes from the old westerns
7820181 but realistically were very careful about the people we take onto the program

7820247 once someone moves into a building its very difficult to get them out
7820248 the court will be sympathetic but as far as the law is concerned the yakuza are citizens with the same rights as other tenants
7820249 the dojinkai are a particularly vicious group certainly not as polished as others that prefer to stay out of the limelight they may decide to move out to avoid any more bad publicity but where would they go then
7820250 when you look at the numbers its easy to see how influential they are
7820251 the authorities here are tolerant of the yakuza more than you would like them to be

7820253 does family fragmentation raise the risk of crime and delinquency in a review of 23 recent u s studies published in peerreviewed journals between 2000 and june 2005 all but three found some family structure effects on crime or delinquency married parents appear to reduce both the individual risk and the overall rates of crime that is recent research strongly suggests both that young adults and teens raised in single parent homes are more likely to commit crimes and that communities with high rates of family fragmentation especially unwed childbearing suffer higher crime rates as a result

7820261 the decision is a direct threat to swedens 105 steiner waldorf schools and pre schools 7 000 pupils will be taught by teachers without qualifications in steiner pedagogy
7820262 the syllabus contains literature which conveys scientific inaccuracies that are worse than woolly they are downright dangerous
7820263 it is remarkable that we in sweden are unable to allow other perspectives in norway and finland the state has long since financed the education of waldorf teachers

7820270 i have been told that they punched him he fell down then they kicked him in the head
7820271 its a big tragedy for hastings well see how this affects the language schools and host families those boys are very cruel i knew something would happen because theres always problems here

7820280 the bank holiday weekend was the culmination of a series of successful carnival events during the month of august
7820281 while this incident which happened after the festivities were over and people were on their way home is extremely disappointing it is important that it should not overshadow what is europes greatest street party

7820329 it was very difficult to find venture capital to use it to develop new companies this has been changing
7820330 venture capitalists are starting to come not only from outside brazil to brazil but even inside brazil there have been groups forming
7820331 they are new for brazil and they are designed in brazil
7820332 one of the things i know i want to do is write a theme that will permeate throughout the entire work that will somehow be a universal theme how im going to depict that musically im not sure yet
7820333 when we started the glast project we wanted to find ways to communicate not only the science results to a broad audience but also tell the story of how the observatory was built by an extraordinary international team of scientists and engineers
7820334 the prelude effectively communicates the excitement of building and launching the observatory and provides a glimpse of what glast may see in the high energy universe
7820335 the idea is to get people excited about science at a time when there are lots and lots of budget cuts for science and research at a lot of institutions including stanford
7820336 the more the public is interested in science the better it is going to be so much of what we can be grateful for comes out of cutting edge science research
7820337 i found myself really falling in love with science and with the science behind glast in terms of particle physics cosmology and astronomy
7820338 so its been an eye opener for me as well that these two paradigms are so compatible
7820339 the beauty of this satellite in orbit i really wanted to capture that
7820340 the idea is that it will be a little bit of peter and the wolf meets gustav holsts the planets prokofievs peter and the wolf is a story with the depiction of the story in music with the orchestra theres a section of text which is read and music follows that and sonically depicts what is spoken occasionally there is text under the music
7820341 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7820342 the fall from 97 5 to a three year low of 94 8 was sharper than the consensus forecast but broadly in line with our own expectations
7820343 the decline was due to falls in both business expectations and perceptions of current conditions
7820344 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders
7820345 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7820346 the only black spot was that copper earnings were down slightly after they had some mining issues during the year
7820347 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7820348 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7820349 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7820350 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7820351 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7820352 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7820353 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7820354 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7820355 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7820356 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7820357 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7820358 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7820359 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later

7820370 as with previous multi year drm development efforts this one disintegrated like wet kleenex on contact with the general public now that vista hdcp blu ray and hd dvd are all broken it seems like the millions of dollars and thousands of work hours sunk into these systems was mis spent the only benefit that these anti copying systems confer to the companies that developed them is the right to sue competitors and that benefit could have been had by shellacking a one atom thick layer of token drm onto their systems just enough to be able to invoke the dmca everything else was just gold plating wasted money

7820372 while you are lauding la guardias virtues i think you should remember his lack of foresight in closing the minsky theaters he used autocratic powers the burlesque industry lacked funds to fight for its constitutional rights

7820388 the rainfall so far has been fine good even we have been in a drought for a couple years so rain is good especially since we dry farm rain during bloom is bad and the grapes are just starting to bloom but we have missed a lot of the rain this week that other parts of the state has had hail is always bad heavy hail can be very bad it could wipe out a considerable part of the crop we did have hail here about a month ago but it was not detrimental to the vines since we dry farm we rely on the rain and so a shower a week all summer long would be ideal july seems to be really dry the last couple years which is bad for us since that is when the grapes need moisture to plump up also our vineyard is away from any major flooding river so excess rain early in the year is no problem for us

7820428 services design and develop medical apparatus providing enhanced surgical capabilities and medical systems in the nature of augmented surgical equipment
7820429 does not utilize artificial intelligence as a substitute for a human operator and accordingly is not robotic
7820430 although the term neurosurgical would be descriptive of the purpose of the equipment developed by applicant deletion of the
7820431 applicants identification of its goods which is replete with surgical instruments designed to augment the surgeons capabilities falls squarely within the definition of neurobotics in this record the fusion of neuroscience and robotics for augmenting human capabilities
7820432 a prima facie case which has not been rebutted by the applicant that the term neurobotics is merely descriptive of a significant feature of applicants goods and services namely devices and design services that mimic human neurological control structures and logic to create surgical robots that augment the human surgeons capabilities
7820433 there is no reason to believe that physicians and hospitals would even know of the purported emerging field of neurobotics
7820434 would be familiar with this term and understand its value with regard to the goods and services and thus would be deceived
7820435 the biomimetic feature of the goods and its augmentation of the surgeons capability would be highly desirable
7820436 very little details were given but i was assured it would be sizeable
7820437 dates wise i also discovered that the first piece of gta downloadable content will be arriving in november as well
7820438 bringing roughly 15 hours of additional play time im expecting either an additional island or a new family bringing new missions will be interesting to see whether or not this progresses the core story

7820444 euheart is a very exciting project that will bring together the latest advances in modeling and computing to improve the care of patients with heart disease
7820445 it may ultimately allow us to select and optimize the best treatment for individual patients
7820446 the development of computer models that integrate structural and functional information of the heart and then personalize it to individual patients is a mammoth task that will require the multi disciplinary effort of researchers with strong know how in biophysical modeling and image processing clinical experts and engineers in the device and imaging industries
7820447 in the euheart project we are confident that we have brought together the necessary expertise and that we can make a real contribution to improving the treatment of one of the worlds killer diseases
7820448 a shift of such magnitude can only happen by developing and implementing breakthrough biomeasurement bioinformatics biologically based and health information technologies that can be integrated with current efforts to improve health care delivery
7820449 before these technologies can be realized and commercialized however a long term economic health care strategy must be established with clear metrics for measuring and determining the value of emerging bio and information technologies
7820450 creating this strategy will facilitate proper allocation of financial resources and ensure a focus on implementing the most promising technologies

7820474 vieram pessoas de todos os cantos de londres para ajudar a recuperar o barco lembro me de um taxista que ajudou com a parte el ctrica mud mos os motores e um dia antes de o barco partir ainda estava a cravar lhe o nome no casco para que nunca mais sa sse
7820475 o nosso principal objectivo era impedir a ca a comercial baleia comum na isl ndia
7820476 pusemos o pneum tico em frente ao navio japon s yushin maru n 2 entre a baleia e o arp o sab amos que n o iriam atacar connosco ali mas de repente dispararam por cima das nossas cabe as e atingiram a baleia que teve morte imediata
7820477 fic mos sentados no bote sem saber o que fazer foi um choque n o sab amos se hav amos de cortar a corda contact mos o arctic sunrise que se encontrava relativamente longe para pedir instru es foi ent o que o yushin maru come ou a puxar a corda
7820478 at a confiava neles no respeito que tinham pelas nossas vidas apenas arriscava colocar me entre a baleia e o arp o porque sabia que n o iriam disparar se estivessem seres humanos ao seu alcance hoje j n o assim n o estou aqui para ser um m rtir
7820479 sempre que um lado muda de t ctica o outro responde com coisas novas quando eles arranjaram canh es de gua para nos atingir equip mos os nossos botes com escudos agora adopt mos jactos de gua nos nossos pneum ticos para dificultar a vis o aos atiradores vamos ver como v o responder
7820480 dantes as nossas ac es n o tinham qualquer cobertura medi tica hoje s o bastante faladas
7820481 pode salvar uma baleia mas n o pode estar l para salvar todas

7820544 i look forward with horror to contact with the other inhabited planets if there are such we would only transport to them all of our sin and our acquisitiveness and establish a new colonialism i cant bear to think of it but if we on earth were to get right with god of course all would be changed once we find ourselves spiritually awakened we can go to outer space and take the good things with us that is quite a different matter
7820545 jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life
7820546 for we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this tent we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling if indeed when we have taken it off we will not be found naked for while we are still in this tent we groan under our burden because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life
7820547 listen i will tell you a mystery we will not all die but we will all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed for this perishable body must put on imperishability and this mortal body must put on immortality when this perishable body puts on imperishability and this mortal body puts on immortality then the saying that is written will be fulfilled death has been swallowed up in victory where o death is your victory where o death is your sting the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ
7820548 but the day of the lord will come like a thief and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise and the elements will be dissolved with fire and the earth and everything that is done on it will be disclosed since all these things are to be dissolved in this way what sort of persons ought you to be in leading lives of holiness and godliness waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of god because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire but in accordance with his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth where righteousness is at home
7820549 for the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of god for the creation was subjected to futility not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of god

7820557 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7820558 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7820559 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7820560 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7820561 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon
7820562 the moon is hot or cool depending on what your generation is
7820563 but i dont think we have to go sell the moon i think it sold itself
7820564 but im here to tell you its not your fathers oldsmobile

7820679 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting
7820680 there has been a tendency to use technology as a substitute for curriculum
7820681 technique and how to ideas have taken the place of deciding what it is exactly we want these children to learn
7820682 but i have nothing against the technology if its in the service of grown ups facing their responsibilities to decide what the students need to know precisely if they did that these technical gadgets will be valuable
7820683 it gives kids a chance to use things they already use in real life and make that connection in school
7820684 we did have to take a hard line approach to that
7820685 you can restrict all kinds of stuff and you can drive yourself nuts trying to police all of it they culbreth are probably kind of opening themselves up to something
7820686 these teachers say this pilot signals their commitment to our students to meet them where they are as opposed to where the teachers are comfortable

7820705 it feels like this is the last big party before a general election that the democrats are sure to lose
7820706 its the political equivalent of re arranging the chairs on the deck of the titanic it feels like that because of the polls the pick of joe biden telescoped that barack obama knows his weaknesses he doesnt have experience in foreign policy and he does not connect well to ordinary people and joe biden doesnt fix that he just magnifies the problem hes a fine guy i want him to go back to the senate
7820707 i think the majority of hillary supporters are coming back and coming home
7820708 the purpose of the convention is to help bring back that group whos undecided since theyre persuadable clinton has to say in a full throated emotional way how strongly she feels about the party uniting
7820709 i didnt think it would happen because it is not in the character of barack obama to admit his weaknesses
7820710 i think his ego is sooooo out of proportion so he could not admit he needed her so
7820711 the loyalty of the clintons to the democratic party is bullet proof
7820712 they are showing more loyalty to this party than anyone could expect them to the people who are disloyal to the principles of this party are howard dean and nancy pelosi howard dean did nothing to speak out about sexism during the primary howard dean contrived a rules committee meeting that was the ultimate corruption howard dean and nancy pelosi took 18 million people and trashed them by saying you dont matter obama is our man the left wing has won so theres no one more loyal to the democratic party than the clintons
7820713 has been up until the last minute sen clinton would have in one strike added the most advantage to the democratic ticket that said obama had the advantage of having a selection of many very good people short of sen clinton i think sen biden was the next best choice
7820714 and i think he is someone who has a wonderful life story and more importantly not only will help obama as an experienced running mate but also will help obama rebuild bipartisanship in washington there has been a small set of people who dont believe this but as momentum begins to gather i think more and more of that sub section will rally around obama when people begin to look at the positions of sen clinton versus that of sen mccain i think they will find the similarities in positions between sen clinton and sen obama quite amazing
7820715 i think picking joe biden is a very sound choice hes a sound pick i think hes a really decent person obama picking him is reassuring it shows that hes surrounding himself with strong people
7820716 people have to decide what they want for the next four years it is time to move on this race is between john mccain and barack obama its no longer about hillary clinton
7820717 states like new york and california that are deeply democratic states will go for him
7820718 what he cannot win are the states john kerry lost
7820719 hes trying to aggregate all of his principles to the center but its not going to work
7820720 people arent stupid they think people are all fools who are going to not go beyond obamas words and not look at a democratic party thats putting its cigarettes in the eyes of the clintons this party wins when we care about peoples problems deep down not only when we think peoples problems are the price of arugula or say theyre bitter with their religion and their guns we dont connect we dont work that way as a party maybe therell be some miracle and those impressions will all be erased but i doubt it
7820721 im going to wait for both vice presidential candidates and im going to wait after both conventions it would feel awful i have been such a loyal democrat my entire life im proud of what bill clinton has done for this nation and i feel so good for being a tiny tiny part of giving america the best president weve had since f d r to leave that party for even one election would hurt me it would be based much more in sadness than anger but its a principled decision im going to deal with the facts as i see them

7820724 it is between michael and the club but in an ideal world we would all like his contract sorted out sooner rather than later
7820725 at the same time though he has got the rest of the season with his current contract but he has got a presence about him michael is a renowned centre forward and a world renowned goalscorer
7820726 when he leads us out it sends a message to other teams it tells them that we have some real quality in our side he is the most world renowned player we have at the club
7820727 people sometimes say when you are in a good position you need to go to a better team but i have something to pay back to the club when the club has done something good for you you have to be aware of it and do something good for the club
7820728 they offered me the chance to become a better player that is why i came here in the first place and thats also the reason why i signed the new deal

7820785 local people are feeling let down by gordon browns labour government that is out of touch and has forgotten the people of fife
7820786 many local people were hit by the labour government when they doubled the 10p tax rate whereas the liberal democrats are planning to cut the basic rate of income tax
7820787 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7820788 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7820789 the proposal to add 7 500 in these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who at the moment we expect to keep separate from one another
7820790 for over a decade this government has failed to provide adequate jail places but huge prisoner warehouses the largest in europe are not the right answer whats needed is a network of smaller local prisons with better integration with local communities and a new focus on reducing re offending so that we can arrest the growth in the prison population in the right way
7820791 these new titan prison complexes will not be warehouses prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour
7820792 they will represent value for money for the taxpayer and best support the chances of cutting re offending by building in facilities aimed at rehabilitation
7820793 the primary goal will be to support research that focuses on elucidating exactly how neural circuits of the brain carry out information processing that directly underlies behaviour
7820794 delighted that the wellcome trust wellcome is collaborating with them for the purpose of developing a new research centre in neural circuits and behaviour

7820806 as sharepoint becomes increasingly strategic to law firms so too does the need to ensure that the right people have access to the right information
7820807 adding sharepoint security management capabilities to wall builder is a welcome enhancement to an excellent product not only does this reduce our firm s risk profile but it also provides a huge competitive advantage for us as it allows our firm to quickly and efficiently deploy secure extranet sites for client collaboration
7820808 law firms are increasingly using microsoft sharepoint as a way to increase attorney productivity by providing them with a centralized view of client information
7820809 by extending wall builder confidentiality controls to sharepoint we re helping law firms ensure that attorneys and staff can t accidentally access client or internal firm information they shouldn t

7820815 but basketball is not part of my life right now
7820816 back in the day nobody knew him but villanova said we want to follow you
7820817 they offered him before anybody else got involved he took an unofficial visit up there its a small school with great academics and he felt comfortable with the whole situation
7820818 i really was just getting back into feeling 100 percent
7820819 i had a great week of practice that week and i was feeling really good then to get hurt really just kind of crushed my attitude
7820820 i took all those months off and started rehabbing it and taking it real slow and i think that really helped
7820821 he didnt do anything in the spring because we wanted to be 100 percent certain that his arm was going to be healed
7820822 hes had no restrictions in august most of our kids came back the first monday of august so he hit the ground running
7820823 hes still a little rusty because he hasnt done anything with 11 people but his arm strength is just about back to normal and his accuracy is still there
7820824 i really didnt want to let my team down to get hurt like that was tough to deal with but really im just hoping for the best this year i feel a lot better
7820825 we looked at the blueprint at what weve been doing and made some intelligent decisions without really panicking everybody
7820826 people are expecting penn to be old news and washed up we want them to think that
7820827 to get the swagger back we need to start winning games if you keep losing nobodys going to respect you we came in here expecting to win championships if not the first year the second year if not the second year at some point now our times kind of running out were getting a little antsy you can sense it especially with the older guys
7820828 you just keep plugging away each year everybody comes in with a clean slate i like being the underdog really it just makes us hungrier we want to show people what we can do
7820829 before we spent an awful lot of time making sure they didnt get too confident
7820830 now you have to be really concerned that you build enough confidence its a fragile program from that sense
7820831 we have to get some of the kids buying back into everything believing they can win the tight games thats one reason we went with a whole new approach
7820832 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7820833 these are things that we can do right now for the customer
7820834 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now
7820835 hondas been a fuel economy leader for an entire generation because we bake in good fuel economy at the design stage
7820836 we just really paid attention to detail in fuel economy
7820837 all these little things you start to get a half percent here a percent here you add these up its that attention to detail thats whats given some of our competitors in the past the japanese an advantage
7820838 weve combined all that were going to overtake them or equal them
7820839 he is now leading vocally but he leads also by his work ethic
7820840 if you spend a dollar with a local farmer he or she will invest some of that dollar back into the farming operation helping to pay the mortgage perhaps at a local bank paying local people who work on the farm purchasing gas for the tractor locally etc some of your dollar will hopefully be profit profit that provides the farm family with its income and keeps the land in farming if you spend a dollar on food in the supermarket only about 20 cents on average makes it back to the farmer
7820841 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7820842 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7820843 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7820844 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7820845 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7820846 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7820847 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7820848 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7820849 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7820850 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7820851 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7820852 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7820853 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later
7820854 note i did not say tiresome its far from that its only 11 25 here as i begin to write this and im completely wiped first thing i did after the credentials committee meeting was head to the big tent to score my own credentials and ended up with a swag bag
7820855 i think of most bloggers as almost like the 19th century press its a very partisan bunch
7820856 bloggers might be the most likely commentators to go offscript
7820857 bloggers are so ubiquitous they actually might be more likely to be on the scene of something interesting and newsworthy than mainstream reporters
7820858 anyone who can write a sentence is welcome to blog the news
7820859 a blogger who writes about farming will ask delegates about farm policy
7820860 youll never get that with the mainstream media because theyre always focused on the horse race
7820861 we are showing the world that not only do we know about facebook
7820862 hes the kind of candidate that comes along once in a lifetime
7820863 i want to do as much as i can to get him elected
7820864 well probably have no more than 30 people with his speech at 10 p m it will be nice to watch with other obama supporters
7820865 hes not a cold warrior or from the vietnam era or civil rights era so he doesnt come with all that baggage hes got a new fresh younger way of looking at things mccain wants to recite vietnam again and its not that kind of world any more im for obama and for a global world
7820866 i believe obama is going to be the best president weve ever had
7820867 my husband is a republican and i turned democrat and neither of us is happy with the republican party on any level of government
7820868 i think most people who have been reading and studying up are realizing that what weve been told about iraq and gas prices is not the truth if mccain or another republican takes office it could affect the country for years we need to see some changes
7820869 he supports middle class families and is focused on bringing more jobs to america
7820870 i like his economic views and his emphasis on ending the war that has been a big strain and hardship on families and i like the candidate himself he is willing to work with both parties his is a fascinating story with his background and his caring heart i look forward to him being the president of the united states
7820871 we want to support him talk to others who support him and get more votes for him in muskingum county
7820872 i think it will be fun to get together with other supporters and see their reaction to the speech i think hell give a great speech this party is to celebrate the fact that hes at the convention and accepting the nomination i want to show obama that people here in muskingum county support him im excited this is the time to have him as president and i hope mccains smear campaign doesnt destroy him
7820873 i look forward to getting together with friends talking and listening to what obama has to say at the convention
7820874 well have lots of delicious food and so far weve got 20 people coming
7820875 i look forward to everyone coming out and supporting obama and having fun at the party
7820876 podemos entrar y salir de georgia cuando queramos la pr xima vez los tanques llegar n a tiblisi
7820877 i told anthony you are my age and i dont know what to say
7820878 he looks so mature and after all hes been through its amazing
7820879 i think a lot of people our age should take an example from him it makes you feel fortunate for what you have
7820880 sometimes at our age we think we know everything but we dont know anything thats the truth you have to fight for your dream and you have to fight for everything but you have to feel fortunate for what you have
7820881 he kept fighting for his dream which was to beat the cancer and he made it and now he has a bright future for sure
7820882 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7820883 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7820884 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7820885 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7820886 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7820887 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7820888 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7820889 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7820890 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7820891 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7820892 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7820893 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7820894 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7820895 there are many roads that we can take to get to 270
7820896 if mccain does not win florida and ohio he has no chance zero of being the 44th president of the united states
7820897 sen mccain is a man who has been in the senate for more than 20 years and is relatively well known to the american people
7820898 then you have sen obama who is not as well known nationally someone people are still getting to know
7820899 and i think that there is much more room for growth on sen obamas side than on sen mccains if ohio voters are not for sen mccain now its not likely they ever will be
7820900 what bush did in 2004 was max out the republican vote
7820901 the question is can john mccain do the same thing if the answer is no mccains cooked in ohio
7820902 weve seen a massive pick up in enthusiasm and volunteer activity in the past four to six weeks
7820903 and the polls look good obama has had all the celebrity and all the money in the world and he still cant pull away from us
7820904 he has to get out there in the small towns the suburbs the rural areas and take ted strickland with him
7820905 teds enormously popular he can go all over ohio and say look this fellow is all right

7821022 i hate to see it not have any protection at all
7821023 the delisting of the west virginia northern flying squirrel appears to be part of the bush administrations plan to gut the endangered species act by keeping rare species off the list undercutting protections for some on the list and removing others from the list altogether
7821024 based on data from more than 20 years of monitoring the squirrels presence in the forest as well as the completion of extensive habitat analysis our scientists are confident that the squirrel has recovered to the point where it no longer requires federal protection
7821025 only 10 flying squirrels in four separate areas were located
7821026 the fish and wildlife service has really cooked the books to make it appear that the squirrel is safe when it really isnt

7821034 hondas been a fuel economy leader for an entire generation because we bake in good fuel economy at the design stage
7821035 we just really paid attention to detail in fuel economy
7821036 all these little things you start to get a half percent here a percent here you add these up its that attention to detail thats whats given some of our competitors in the past the japanese an advantage

7821043 its almost looking us in the eye and thats just not right
7821044 we already know that were just the second tallest mountain in the area and were okay with that
7821045 lookout mountain residents dont need to lord it over us its ridiculous and a slap in the face
7821046 they may try all they want but they cant just bury their past
7821047 the residents are used to being called ditch people anyway so it shouldnt bother them too much

7821050 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7821051 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline therefore peter will need to modify his approach
7821052 he has got two good assistants so they should sit down and look at the reasons they are doing so poorly if they do that they will come up with a modified approach
7821053 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful
7821054 he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that
7821055 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach

7821062 at this point if they build it here i dont know if i want to be here anymore
7821063 i decided to pull the old car out of the garage and see how i felt today get some of the dust off of it

7821076 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later
7821077 they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence we have seen serious incidents in previous years
7821078 one success from this was stopping a car with two people in possession of a taser and a baseball bat and we believe they were intent on taking them into the event
7821079 despite taking significant number of potential troublemakers off the streets and seizing dozens of weapons a small minority still managed to marr the end of what had been a largely good natured and peaceful two days of celebrations
7821080 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7821081 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7821082 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7821083 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7821084 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7821085 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music

7821100 this was certainly the toughest trans event ive done ever ever ever
7821101 i think the conditions made this an even bigger challenge than it would be anyway
7821102 it was certainly the toughest trans event weve ever done but the fact that the riders are still here after a week of going through some big ups and downs really impressed me like no tomorrow it was a challenging week but it continued the spirit of the event of people helping each other out and mucking in together

7821108 that is not enough we are still selling tca so we had to progress from this
7821109 now we leave the medieval behind and enter the space age
7821110 it was sunny it was warm and there were some great natural descents very steep and rocky very technical with loose sections and extremely fast
7821111 ive had a fantastic time and am absolutely loving it i had a sense of humour failure on the first two days but ive recovered now ive met some really nice people and its been really inspiring
7821112 its easy to have one good bit of riding that youre good at
7821113 whether thats climbing descending or fitness but here you have to be good at everything all the time and be super fit and mentally hardy as well
7821114 i know its going to be a long day but i know i can do it so im really looking forward to getting out there after everything its going to be great to chill out with all the people weve ridden with have a few drinks although im also really sad its the last day im definitely going to be coming back again
7821115 the final descent of the day dropped down a stunning mountain valley
7821116 a snaking rocky section of trail on the final descent was one to savour
7821117 another river crossing to negotiate and one last climb out to bring an end to the penultimate day
7821118 stunning scenery has been a major part of the riding experience on the merida bikes transwales
7821119 sweeping through the change over area before heading up the leg buster climb
7821120 the final descent at nant y arian is a peach of flowing singletrack to be savoured
7821121 nant y arian provided the venue for a fitting finale to the competitive part of the merida bikes transwales with a blend of natural trail big climbs and swooping singletrack
7821122 woods singletrack on the special stage kept riders on their toes
7821123 we find sometimes bugs bullets rocks all sorts of things in the cork that are not desirable
7821124 there is actually much more cork in a diam than in a traditional cork
7821125 this is the only french made machine in the entire plant we have italian machines lots of german machines some japanese machines but this is the only french and now it is not used anymore
7821126 it is not a question of if the level is acceptable or not the goal is to make it undetectable with the most modern methods available
7821127 you couldnt treat corks because it would stretch them out of shape but you could load planks into the machine and punch them after treatment it just would take an enormous amount of time and energy since there would be much less surface area but even so this does not solve some of the other problems of corks namely each one of them performs differently in terms of oxygen transmission and flavor masking or contribution we want to make a better more consistent product

7821140 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
7821141 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
7821142 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
7821143 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
7821144 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
7821145 the five year study has greatly contributed to our knowledge of sperm whales especially those found in the gulf of mexico its also raised new questions we need to know more about such as their feeding and breeding patterns theres still a lot we dont know about these huge creatures
7821146 our dna analysis corroborates what the historical sources say namely that vanilla was a trade item brought to tahiti by french sailors in the mid 19th century the french admiral responsible for introducing vanilla to tahiti alphonse hamelin used vanilla cuttings from the philippines the historical record tells us that vanilla which isnt native to the philippines was previously introduced to the region via the manila galleon trade from the new world and specifically from guatemala
7821147 the pre columbian maya had been managing their forests for millennia to cultivate cacao and to make chocolate and we know they were also cultivating vanilla to use it as a chocolate spice the maya created these forest gardens by introducing different types of species of wild cacao and vanilla from the surrounding forests which meant that species that had previously been geographically separated were then able to hybridize because they were in the same place thats the scenario we present in our research paper for how tahitian vanilla got started it is an evolutionary product but also a maya artifact
7821148 pesach has demonstrated that vanilla species can exchange genes quite frequently across species barriers
7821149 this provides an opportunity to breed new commercial varieties of vanilla through hybridization in the future

7821155 i really need to survey everywhere i can this year
7821156 in calculating the counties with wheat acreage infected in the northern panhandle early diagnosis could save as much as 9 million for producers by eliminating wasted irrigations
7821157 we werent testing for triticum at that time so it is also a factor to be investigated
7821158 we have the potential to save producers billions of dollars in wasted irrigation and fertilizer costs
7821159 the main time people irrigate in this area is in the late spring and summer during grain fill and heading

7821209 even as overall sales volume drops relatively stronger demand for housing will limit price declines in neighborhoods with shorter work commutes better schools and easier access to parks recreation and retail centers prices for homes in outlying neighborhoods will continue their more rapid decline and will be slower to rebound when housing markets finally start to recover

7821234 that would be an investigation by the public health agency of canada and the local health units
7821235 they do the food history so they would make the linkages
7821236 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked

7821240 first the good news polls by the zogby organization show bob barr pulling as much as 5 of the popular vote nationwide and double that in some states if this materializes we should all be excited but early polls usually show third party candidates getting two to four times the vote they actually receive in november i still hope and expect barr to receive the highest vote total of any presidential candidate to date i e more than 921 000 and think he is likely to exceed our best percentage showing 1 06 in 1980 this will require about 1 3 million votes but i think it could happen unfortunately the good news pretty much ends there

7821255 well after sending the police on their way we explained to the staff that the spider was part of a zoological loan
7821256 the venom isnt fatal unless youre allergic to it she isnt but she is in one of our hospitals receiving anti venom treatments it
7821257 it will be awhile before she is released but she will go home and back to work once she is
7821258 ok lets see the freak show do i need to buy a ticket
7821259 this will be worth the price of admission i guaranty it
7821260 this one is refrigerated for the hunters to store their prizes so be ready for the cold itll come as a shock at first but with these things being cold blooded it was decided to keep them cold puts them in a state of quasi hibernation and slows them down quite a bit
7821261 here you go detective take a look at the quarry these are the two we captured at the mine
7821262 all this and theyve been clocked at better than thirty five miles an hour imagine that coming at you in the middle of the night and all you have is a service 38 or maybe a glock 9mm neither will pierce its hide
7821263 now let me fill in the gaps as i said earlier we found seventeen hatched casings two are under that lexan cage one is dead with a carving knife in its back that leaves fourteen loose
7821264 and i mentioned they give off a slight radioactive signature we have four choppers in the air with monitoring equipment keeping track of thirteen of them in the mountains the choppers also have heat sensing equipment to differentiate the spiders from the soldiers my mens electronic equipment gives off just enough radiation to give false positive readings when the time comes well close on the spiders and remove them
7821265 and that leaves one that one weve tracked into the city unfortunately with all the ground cover as well as background interference from cell phones ground transportation microwaves home electronics and such tracking it is difficult at best add in the things speed and you can see our problem we dont want to send troops swarming into the north end of the city looking for this thing
7821266 where you come in is we need a presence in the city that wont attract attention one that can move freely with our guidance to catch and or destroy the last spider quietly
7821267 quietly you already said they were damn near bullet proof that it would take an armor piercing round to take one out exactly
7821268 the techs from inventink should be ready for us now
7821269 so tell me how are you keeping people out of the area
7821270 my team relieved the park rangers and secured the area we have sentries on all points of access and more moving through the woods to create a herding presence keeping the spiders in our perimeter
7821271 most of what we needed was already here and assembled when i picked you up the remaining material will be finished shortly what we have for your team has just been finished
7821272 you dont suffer fools well and youve got a pair of jokers in this deck
7821273 albino snow pig and maybe a moon bat just got our licenses
7821274 i guess its too late to ask you to turn around now besides
7821275 yes they are general dont let the looks mislead you
7821276 worked the field and the streets detective ive looked worse myself if you back them thats good enough for me by the way ive done some checking
7821277 you dont exist officially anyway glad to have you on board now lets get the troops inside and get this going
7821278 ok folks lets follow the general inside and get this going
7821279 man that is almost as disgusting as the stuff kaiser eats
7821280 street savvy group confident relaxed cocky yet they have a quick eye and mind for detail all undercover i presume
7821281 wont be for long she has what it takes either work the streets or become a detective like yourself maybe higher up the chain if she desires
7821282 well five are married and three are single two of the married ones will sleep together during this situation
7821283 jimenez kicked the habit before joining the force that gives him the drive to run the street and whitedove she left the reservation to come here she is still debating going back feels like she ran out on the family
7821284 nope just read them like a book survival detective you learn that if you want to stay alive in my business dont cross a t dot an i or if you misread between the lines youre retired permanently
7821285 i cant figure you or switt out other than her drive to advance and her ability to be a great cop thats good enough though i dont think i want to know you any better it feels safer that way so dont look for me to ask about it we keep this in the present tense and well both be happier and maybe healthier
7821286 general id forgotten you would be here with company forgive me for not being more cordial
7821287 quite all right dr willems please meet detective frankin she is part of the operation here
7821288 ms frankin then my pleasure glad to have you on board now tell me how much do you know about lasers
7821289 ok lets start with the basics and well go from there
7821290 now for a laser that is little more than a novelty you need more power and a very bright light or a modified application to produce the same effect that is what we have here
7821291 with the research accomplished by dr baser and his assistant mr lassert we now have a high powered laser without all the cumbersome support equipment their predecessors required it is the bassert ag the combination of the two researchers bas er and las sert and what it is an a ggregation g un
7821292 what they did was combine a chemical reaction light source with the introduction of exotic gasses to produce a low power high output laser
7821293 the main or solid part of the rod is inside an elliptical reflector the chemical flash lamp is within the reflector area total coverage to the rod no hot or cool spot
7821294 now as the laser enters the hollow part of the assembly this band here
7821295 is where the mixture of exotics is injected the exotics are carried down the tube and excited as they go they are excited and accelerated toward the speed of the light exiting the tube is a concentrated beam of light wave and particle a plasma beam if you will
7821296 the down sides are the power level on this small a scale is not adjustable for safety reasons the other is that since particles greater than sub atomic are used they are influenced greatly by the laws of physics in short they slow down and lose their excited state quickly after approximately forty five meters you have a gun sight
7821297 use the scopes to look at the target when i am ready to fire ill tell you it will be a quick spot on the target so look sharply
7821298 the first shots were without the gases this one will be with the gases
7821299 that weapon has been tuned for the project this one
7821300 has a wider focal point it sends the pulse out more like a shotgun ear muffs please
7821301 the tuning of the guns is necessary to bring the beam into focus for the job the guns are like i said more like a shotgun they can be choked like a shotgun for maximum range and power the first one is tuned this one isnt yet
7821302 you also noticed that the farther away the target gets the less damage is done to it the beam losses power as it travels the more interference it encounters the faster it degrades when the gasses are introduced they interfere immediately therefore the range is limited by the amount of power available in the initial flash focusing the beam is necessary to achieve the maximum range and stopping potential
7821303 after all making this mobile puts weight constraints on the system if you are expected to wear and carry this something has to give
7821304 you and your crew will be using a smaller version
7821305 how does it feel not digging in anywhere is it
7821306 she said trying to evade any more handling then looked back at the general in time to see the last remnants of a smile slide from his face definitely my first target she thought with venom dripping off every word
7821307 first of all there is only a limited supply of materials available to you you have enough fuel for the flash lamp to be fired fifteen times thats all dont waste it
7821308 the gasses are good for ten rounds with luck youll need them at closer ranges the laser by itself should do the job but we are talking close here under 5 meters with as fast as they move thats too close in my opinion
7821309 last the exhaust gasses from the flash lamp go down and out the handle of the gun where you would normally load a new clip into thats where the exhaust comes out it will be very hot if you lean the butt of the gun against something when you fire be prepared for it to get burned so be careful
7821310 now let me fill you in on the basics of how to operate the gun
7821311 yeah she doesnt like it there the water is wet and cold and it bothers her
7821312 well now that could be an issue if you had to stay in the water all the time can you show me where in the water she is
7821313 will she talk to me like she does you now that i see her
7821314 no she doesnt trust anyone but me somebody must have hurt her badly at some point so she only trusts me
7821315 i see well next time you speak to her tell her i am a friend okay
7821316 gladys you remember i told you you cant bring food back here because it attracts bugs
7821317 yeah and i cant feed the lady if i dont
7821318 its all right here along with a case of gonorrhea youre going to need shots better call the doctor and youd better tell that girlfriend of yours to call hers as well
7821319 bad boo boo momma bad boo boo stick man momma stick man
7821320 dont want to ruin the ages of oil soaked into the bowls now do we mr stanopolis will say
7821321 that dinner tonight they want the big caesar bowls or the small
7821322 the ultimate party girl as long as the party includes squeaky toys you all should be ashamed trying to scare little ol me
7821323 before we go any further you have all been selected for a special assignment anything said inside this room or about the assignment must be kept to yourselves if you dont feel that you can keep this information a secret let detective frankin or myself know now so we can get a replacement in here
7821324 frankin will be in charge of this assignment you will report directly to her as the lead until this is completed you will be relieved of your regular duties to concentrate on the task at hand this comes down from the governors office with the mayor giving full cooperation take it seriously
7821325 to begin with to be comfortable we will be wearing street clothes
7821326 next each of you will carry a handheld radio you will not be using your regulation radios these have a closed frequency we can talk to each other in private
7821327 i selected you people because of your marksmanship deductive and athletic skills driving skills clean records and ability to keep a lid on your cases and the information you found
7821328 we will be set up in pairs with rough terrain vehicles for the rest of the briefing we need to go to another location the pairings with the vehicles are on the board
7821329 who came up with the pairings and the cars what if i dont like kaiser and his smelly lunches in that little jeep how about we get the cherokee
7821330 dont talk to him and lower the rag top to get plenty of fresh air
7821331 and i dont care if you like kaiser or not there are five women and three men you were paired up in couples to attract as little attention as possible switts with me because weve worked together before and she knows how not to piss me off
7821332 and you cant have the cherokee its bought and paid for by me the rest of the vehicles came from impound they have been fitted with antennae for these radios so dont forget to plug them in
7821333 so grab a radio get your car from out back and lets get on the road we have some driving to do
7821334 read this it will keep you occupied while we pick up some supplies
7821335 take off the helmet and follow me if she wanted to see something very interesting
7821336 hey general johnny is just finishing up polishing the last of your order itll only take a minute to finish and check the piece
7821337 whats right with this picture the damn polishing machine still goes berserk and doesnt shut down at the end of the cycle 90 days until the iso deadline and were still stopping machines by yanking their power supply
7821338 im telling you its that scrum type interface when the os crashes this polisher gets weird what it needs is a newer computer or an operating system that doesnt crash
7821339 well lets get the part checked the customer is here for pick up and we dont want to keep them waiting
7821340 sorry general it will only take a minute to check the part and get it crated then well load it up for you
7821341 johnny is checking the synthetic ruby actually chromium doped sapphire for imperfections that machine he is using to check the part is a comparator if there are no imperfections its ready to go
7821342 we melt the sapphire to make things like the rod johnny is checking on the end of the leaders going into those ovens is a little seed that the melted sapphire adheres to and takes the molecular structure of the seed with the engineered seed we can grow what we need from the sapphire
7821343 that particular piece was tricky it is a solid rod on one end and a hollow tube on the other we used the inventink division of symmetrically incorporated to engineer the process we grow the solid part first then stick the hollow tube seed to the base of the rod on the outside the seed distorts the original configuration and starts the second step of the process after that its a case of polishing off the distortions from the outside of the finished part and checking the inside for a smooth transition if all is done right the molecular grain is in line and fluid resulting in zero distortion to the transmitted spectrum
7821344 ok ok youre snake i was told youd prove it in an unorthodox manner but i had no idea how unorthodox
7821345 this mongoose says next time shoot straighter dont know what that means and probably dont want to
7821346 now let me fill you in you know the mine up in the mountains not far from here
7821347 well the family that owned the mine dug a hole over sixty yards wide and over a thousand yards deep in solid granite when they sold it back to the state the state gave it back to the federal government in exchange for funds to make this mountain range such that it is a federal reserve park hunting fishing and camping along with a wildlife preserve for the price of a worthless granite mine
7821348 to uncle sam that hole was a gold mine a totally enclosed storage facility for materials not wanted elsewhere in the 50s and 60s radioactive waste was put down there along with pesticides and other chemical components until a way to dispose of them was found no one noticed but we kept a presence around it for all these years without tipping our hands
7821349 so why the big show of force up here now
7821350 six months ago a crew checked on the mine for leakage they found none then it was discovered that some of the containers were starting to decay so we started working on clearing the stored material out for disposal once a plan was worked out so we could accomplish this without incident spillage or contact with the residents in the area we sent a crew out to get the prep work started that was about three weeks back
7821351 the officers said the staff they talked to claimed the call didnt come from there how was that
7821352 we beat the squad car there by ten minutes we got all the employees in the walk in and stood in for the staff it wasnt hard a kid manager called in but twelve adults talked to your officers convinced them it had to be a prank by some high school kids
7821353 you saw the pictures of the spider after it bit the prep setup lady one of the cooks knocked it to the floor and hit it with the carving knife in his hands 190 pound kid coming down full force with all his weight only drove the knife half way through the thing turns out that thing has an endoskeleton just under the skin that is almost bulletproof and it is a living tissue that grows to accommodate the size of the creature
7821354 think of the ramifications a living bulletproof shell thats flexible and lightweight the d o d is already salivating over the idea
7821355 we brought in an expert entomologist to check this spider out what we found was its a mutant when we rechecked the mine some of the containers had decayed enough to leak there is a mix of radioactive material and chemical wastes down there that triggered the mutation big surprise
7821356 we also found seventeen hatched egg casings and the two missing clean up crew members wrapped in silk stored for dinner
7821357 the entomologist told us the spiders were hunter predators and all male so there wouldnt be a problem with reproducing he also said that with them being cold blooded it would be hard to track them down
7821358 well with them being radioactive it wasnt to hard to track them we managed to capture two of them but it wasnt easy it takes a high powered ap round to pierce their hides and that attracts too much attention that is why we stopped off for those rods on the way up here we have something special in mind
7821359 first lets get some lunch then ill show you the prize catch after that youll see what the rods are for they should be ready by that time
7821360 so high and not able to enjoy their splendor ah well to work
7821361 you have to take pride in what you do always
7821362 just wonderful multiple targets close quarters in a busy club they only give the hardest to the best est
7821363 got to have that free stylin independent upwardly mobile trolling man killer look and this is it
7821364 yeah yeah and youre going to love our night court judge now lets move

7821394 so why now the big show of force up here
7821395 six months ago a crew checked on the mine for leakage they found none then it was discovered that some of the containers were starting to decay so we started working on clearing the stored material out for permanent disposal once a plan was worked out so we could accomplish this without incident spillage or contact with the residents in the area we sent a crew out to get the prep work started that was about three weeks back

7821399 think of the ramifications a living bulletproof shell thats flexible and lightweight the d o d is already salivating over the idea
7821400 we brought in an expert entomologist to check this spider out what we found was its a mutant imagine our shock when we rechecked the mine some of the containers had decayed enough to leak there is a mix of radioactive material and chemical wastes down there that triggered the mutation again big surprise
7821401 we also found seventeen hatched egg casings and the two clean up crew members wrapped in silk stored for dinner
7821402 the entomologist told us the spiders were hunter predators and all male so there wouldnt be a problem with reproducing then the bad news he said that with them being cold blooded it might be hard to track them down
7821403 well with them being radioactive it turned out it wasnt too hard to track them we managed to capture two of them but it wasnt easy it takes a high powered ap round to pierce their hides and that attracts too much attention that is why we stopped off for those rods on the way up here we have something special in mind
7821404 first lets get some lunch then ill show you the prize catch after that youll see what the rods are for they should be ready by that time

7821408 get the door yourself ive the worst month coming up at work being stuck on third shift and i dont need you nagging at me
7821409 damn the e mail isnt there im supposed to be getting a response to an interview i had for a new job
7821410 oh wow theres the docs office i was telling you about there was a fire in one of the apartments above it and that is what caused that big foot to fall
7821411 now let me see if i got this straight miss vivian doffer was doing her routine when a patron became enraged and attacked her with a cane where were your bouncers
7821412 as for our bouncers both were walking the room keeping an eye on people you would expect to cause trouble certainly not a little old man with a cane by the time any of us got there she was our main concern the old man was gone when we next looked up
7821413 mentioned the old guy had an accent british he said the old guy yelled something about how she should be dancing with him like she used to and not sullying her reputation like this
7821414 just the basic stuff youd expect tips billfold drivers license
7821415 drivers license says her name is delores caulfield age 29 i would have guessed maybe 19 by the looks of her guess vivian doffer is just a stage name
7821416 i checked the phone book while in the back and there are two vivian doffers in there
7821417 its a pretty upscale area she lives in perkins what do these girls bring in a night to live in such a nice place
7821418 vivian took in at least six hundred a night on slow nights ask the manager
7821419 i think she has inside knowledge outside our precinct or at least thats what the rumor mill says
7821420 oh so thats how she affords that car of hers and that nice apartment this ought to liven things up for i a if her name gets on their list
7821421 those i a jerks will chase anything that looks below board
7821422 this needs to go back to the precinct we need a good picture of this old guy the tape is set at the time and area he was sitting at the stage and once we get the picture i need someone from immigrations to see if they can match it up with any passport or visa records find out who this guy is
7821423 now get going on that tape and let me know when you have something
7821424 shes in the hospital at the moment an incident at work
7821425 im being a terrible host excuse me but do come in im sure you have either more questions or more information and standing on the stoop is not the place for either
7821426 at no stage does anyone ever mention what happened 3 years 2 months ago we all know what happened and we dont need to be reminded but it is the most important thing that keeps us tied together the reason we shall never drift apart
7821427 if you would like we can take you to all saints hospital where your granddaughter is
7821428 quite all right really ill get by in the morning im sure she isnt up to company tonight and the doctors are probably busy with her and dont need me underfoot
7821429 in case you hadnt noticed im quite able to make calls myself
7821430 besides there isnt anyone else to notify unless you count the aunts and uncles that would rather not be associated with her
7821431 you must get your hearing checked i already said there was no one else to notify delores had no siblings and her mother passed twenty years ago overdose a father was never mentioned or named ive been her whole family for twenty years
7821432 which one her dancing at night or her being an accountant during the day
7821433 didnt know about her being an accountant did you of course not wrong time of day for the wrong kind of work
7821434 as for it bothering me no it doesnt she loves dancing as do i and in a roundabout way i think i taught her most of the steps she knows i could dance from dusk to daylight and never feel tired dancing is how she put herself through college to become an accountant she isnt that established at her day job to make as much money as she does at night even then i doubt if she would give it up its in the blood as is her lack of inhibitions i was just as flamboyant at her age but maybe a bit more reserved when it came to showing skin
7821435 been widowed close to thirty years and thats not my granddaughter thats me the mans name is brice woodrow the picture was taken in the late fifties in england he was a nice gent he was in the r a f we both loved dancing and would go out every night if duties allowed big band and swing were our favorites though the roarin twenties were just as good thats when i wore that dress out at a local hall they had a great band and played only the old stuff
7821436 the outfit including the shawl are the same as she had on you could be twins
7821437 yes we could have been twins in every way i helped her modify that outfit after i gave it to her
7821438 you dont get out of that dress easily when youre an exotic dancer it needed work for quick removal
7821439 now the shawl was a gift it used to be the covering for the bands piano in that hall we danced at it was a plain black piano scarf made of silk but brice wanted something different for me he promised me that the gift would be special that it would be unique and come from the heart he added the finishing touches and prayed that it would fit the bill that night he presented it to me
7821440 i was floored he bought the cover from the piano player and had taken it home he did all the embroidery and fringe work himself men werent that concerned about their image back then none of this macho garbage going around
7821441 a pretty gift with the red roses and green leaves he said the roses were as red as my lips the greens were as bright as our lives and the black the black was for the nights it would be worn long and pleasant
7821442 oh no he shipped out for war about the same time the family was calling me home we lost track of each other i was home for a while when i discovered delores mother was on her way hell of a parting gift like i said my granddaughter and i could be twins leading the life of a gypsy
7821443 i do have a recent photo of him though some friends were in england recently and bumped into him at a school they were thinking of sending their grandchildren to they said they mentioned me and it took a moment for him to remember he let them take a picture of him to bring home to me
7821444 here he is as of last year the typical headmaster of the typical english boarding school
7821445 of course i have another picture of him if you need it it is from the school he runs
7821446 i think the photo will be enough thank you for your time ms doffer
7821447 doc said it was a concussion maybe a few stitches to the scalp youre sure you dont want us to drop you off
7821448 photo the old lady gave you and the tapes match even got a good shot of the cane and its identical also the british constabulary sent some other information to help you out
7821449 seems mr woodrow retired six months ago age and health related he has the beginnings of dementia and goes back in time every now and again seems the governing body of the school thought it best if he retired and didnt introduce the school to criticism
7821450 officials say he updated his passport and came to the states about six weeks ago here is the address its a walk up apartment downtown
7821451 oh dont worry detective ill collect now im off for home unless you need anything else
7821452 looks like we have one more stop before calling it a night
7821453 mr woodrow this is the police would you open the door please
7821454 hit the door bell the apartment curves around and if the window is open he might not hear you over the street noise the doorbell is in the kitchen though and hell
7821455 youre lucky we got here when we did another couple minutes and both of you would have been in bags gas line was pulled free by the blast and depleted all the air in the apartment our preliminary investigation shows the deceased did himself in the old fashion way he blew out all the pilots and stuck his head in the oven stinky but effective he also went to the trouble of making sure no one found him in time by sealing the doors and windows with towels no chance of the gas odor giving him away
7821456 the cause of the blast was the door bell the bell was an old one with the old style coil magnet in it when you hit the button at the door it caused a spark the rest is history they are getting ready to bring him down so if you want to see him detective you better get over there if youre feeling all right that is
7821457 yeah i feel a lot better now besides i can id the deceased if theres anything left of his head
7821458 when the blast happened it only touched off the pockets of gas in the room he happened to be one of those pockets but a lot lower his head and face are ok but the rest of him is a mess kind of ironic really the same kitchen appliance that he used to kill himself was what kept him intact enough for id the stove took most of the blast and protected him from the shoulders up
7821459 the rest of the area has been cleared so your people can get in and finish looking around
7821460 and there was a note confessing to his suicide that somehow survived the blast unlike him here read this
7821461 when i saw you display yourself in such a disgraceful way i knew we were through that wasnt the way we were supposed to dance dancing is like a dazzling pool of water and while a butterfly sips on crocodiles tears my cup has gone dry
7821462 well as he has no relatives i thought i would see if young miss doffer could use it in one of her routines thats provided she wants the cane that could have ended her career from her father the exploding english headmaster
7821463 youve had a hell of a day most of your reports are written you look like someone beat the stuffing out of you and im sure you could use some rest go home finish the reports in the morning then take a couple days off to clear your heads ok
7821464 youd better go now and quickly before anything else happens
7821465 wow so thats what happened at the docs office today
7821466 a big explosion and a fire and a guy died and the foot fell knocking out all the power wow
7821467 what i did what i had to she was driving me crazy all that non stop chatter
7821468 its not you its me she irritates me also but i always wait for you to throw her out
7821469 now now dont worry about it let me get some tea for us and ill refill the bong youll feel better and i dont mind throwing her out anyway
7821470 well if you ask me its a good act and you should be hired
7821471 well i didnt ask you and it is a good act and i have been hired
7821472 and he doesnt know i have the next couple days off so dont make plans for after dancing
7821473 he was making tea and crumpets when the doorbell rang
7821474 billy also mentioned being electrocuted by an alarm system and getting squashed by a big foot
7821475 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7821476 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7821477 as late as 1849 luther lee advised wesleyan methodists against appointing women class leaders except for classes made up solely of women
7821478 the wesleyan methodist general conference voted in 1879 to license women as preachers but not to ordain them subsequently in 1891 the law against their ordination was repealed
7821479 wesleyan methodists still thought of themselves as reformers and in the sense they were living but limited might be the best way to describe the shift of social conscience amusement dress divorce and the sabbath observance preoccupied the church when its attention was turned on society important as they were these issues were focused more on personal behavior than on the greater needs of society the balance was missed
7821480 cinta sejati itu hanya milik allah tak ada yang lain
7821481 but you had that before and the room was bigger
7821482 cause im not giving up my new room for anyone
7821483 not long after i joined the staff however i grew uncomfortable with what i saw and i developed a special animosity a hatred really toward one individual in particular
7821484 some friends and coworkers simply werent interested in meeting my needs and even my closest family member who has a heart of gold and wanted to help me couldnt supply my need
7821485 i believe the key to maintaining love and satisfaction in life is not expecting lasting satisfaction and love to come from gods creation keep those expectations for god alone
7821486 im a gmail user and i really like the functionality
7821487 do you understand this mockup do you want to try it out on our laptop and tell us whether it works for you
7821488 were going to pay for your latte if you have five minutes to look at some screen shots
7821489 were a company with 200 or a company with 5 000 people we want xobni on every single one of our desktops
7821490 give it away and figure out how to charge for something
7821491 how are you going to make money can you really charge for an add in
7821492 oh we have search lets find out how to monetize it
7821493 were going to add this feature to the product because one important customer wants it
7821494 wed buy it if only you would add this feature
7821495 we built this great thing and no one is using it why we should make it more prominent and maybe we should make the button blink or something
7821496 we can forget your credit card and you have to enter it every time
7821497 obviously this stuff works because its being applied to a real system like linux and getting some traction there so can we try it on our code bases
7821498 ok heres the deal heres this site that were about to launch im not letting anybody have access except for you this is for the developers of these projects this isnt for press people to log in and troll through the bugs or hackers to log in and look for vulnerabilities this really is for the developers of the open source package
7821499 oh memory leak i should put a free in there
7821500 oh i guess i should just check that pointer to see if its null or not
7821501 open source software and static source code analysis a perfect match
7821502 look you dont have to open source your component but i want to run some tools on your code base
7821503 this is a gate and we both can agree that when coverity says there are no defects in it we accept that development is complete
7821504 whats going in my code base how is it changing am i ready for release is this code in good shape
7821505 hey you know this pluggable structure that youve got for eclipse is good for building more than just ides you could also build rich client applications with this structure
7821506 why are we stuck with just client applications this stuff works great on a server too
7821507 well its easier for us to change our schedule than for you guys to change your schedule so well just move our releases to a place where you can adopt them
7821508 ok you need to pick the package that others wish and unpack it and see what is inside and then do the patch and apply for it
7821509 put your data in it trust it you can use it go for it and give us feedback
7821510 oh no i have to use some rigid gtd system i dont have time to learn and i dont want to do that
7821511 why would i use this this isnt interesting to me
7821512 hey buy our commercial proprietary application server written in some language youve probably never heard of go train your people in it oh yeah youre completely beholden to us
7821513 hey listen if you guys are willing to host this on our behalf then that would be great were having too many battles with it they dont understand your software they dont understand python they dont understand open source and they dont really want to maintain it every time theres a problem with the server they just point fingers and say theyre not going to fix it
7821514 you dont have to worry if i go out of business because you have my source code
7821515 well you can go out and buy sharepoint theres no reason to knock what sharepoint does out of the box but the day that you need just one more function to enhance the hundreds of things youve already done in that and you get stuck forget about it youd better resign yourself to live within whatever boundaries they set on you
7821516 oh sun owns it now im going to go run to enterprise db
7821517 well maybe kvm is more interesting because its really a community open source kind of thing i felt obligated to contribute to xen when it was more of a community effort but i dont really feel like being a programmer for citrix and just handing my stuff over to them
7821518 whats the pain point in moving away from that for all the people who have some stake in that community
7821519 listen our numbers havent dropped off the way youre seeing in fact were growing it just so happens that more people are accessing del icio us now through the firefox extension for del icio us instead of going to the del icio us website youre looking at comscore numbers you see the traffic dropping off but its actually going up its just coming through a different way
7821520 the same thing is true with twitter overwhelmingly the use of twitter is through the twitter api and not by going to twitter com and typing things in your browser
7821521 we want gtk we want our own toolkit and we want it to be free
7821522 im sorry i dont want you working on that anymore im assigning you to project 123
7821523 go back to working on bsd we need to fix that up
7821524 hey thats great im going to continue using windows with these free applications
7821525 what did we not ask about that you think is interesting
7821526 oh my god i made it across the finish line we got version 4 out
7821527 im going to use that framework and port my application over to the kde 4 code base im going to use these new libraries and toolkits and pillars of kde that youve given me
7821528 we just need our servers to work our databases to run for everybody to get email and for it to be easy to maintain so proprietary software makes sense for us
7821529 all authors like the act of having written the act of writing though they are not so sure about
7821530 well its this missing header thats really causing this strange behavior
7821531 hey the great thing about linux and apache and a lot of these kinds of things are that they are open source so if i really run into a problem i can get into the code and fix it
7821532 well i have no interest in doing that i dont want to run my own private fork of linux or apache i use those as a product there is value in the fact that they were built using an open source methodology but they are not something that i am going to really go in and muck with
7821533 the world would be a better place if everybody released their source code for everything
7821534 well here are all the algorithms we use just go deal with them
7821535 all right guys when are you going to fix the bug
7821536 you know guys we understand we cant release it sooner than that so here is the code
7821537 oh this thing can actually be repaired by a kid with a single screwdriver
7821538 its power consumption is a quarter or tenth of the alternative
7821539 my users are complaining about the way the web email looks
7821540 if it didnt happen in the mailing list it didnt happen
7821541 yeah that sounds cool when will the code be ready
7821542 i agree to assign the ownership of this stuff to microsoft
7821543 i dont think weve fully learned how to do this one particular thing but it would be to our benefit if we do
7821544 we listen to our customers very closely but we dont do everything they say
7821545 yes that direction would benefit us but it would cost us in other areas and those costs outweigh this one benefit
7821546 look we have an architecture that allows you to build any kind of crazy plug in you want but when something becomes really popular and a lot of people find it useful it becomes part of the code base
7821547 well support tagging if you want something fancier thats what the plug in community is for
7821548 does that mean the new york times has become a special interest that wordpress now has to cater to even if what the times wants isnt necessarily what the broader community wants
7821549 the next release of wordpress will be totally customized for partner x or partner y and we dont care about this community we built
7821550 this contributor isnt asking me to go in a different direction hes supporting me because he agrees with what i do
7821551 gee were just going to go in there and clean this place up and change their strategy and you know they should be focusing on a different market and building everything a different way
7821552 we love what you guys are doing and wed love to be a part of it since were already using your product wed like to be closer together both to have more input in what youre doing and to hear more about your ideas for our business
7821553 look guys focus on the news business there are all these open source beauty pageants going on dont get caught up in the hype show me how im going to see a return on my investment
7821554 look we just have to talk to the lawyers because this includes some open source software and we have to make sure that we have all the licenses right and can reuse it in a commercial product et cetera et cetera
7821555 weve got really smart people and theyre able to use the resources at hand and figure stuff out
7821556 this project looks stable it looks like its not going to disappear some day
7821557 if it goes away ill never get any support and ill never understand this
7821558 hey ive just spent x million dollars on this system
7821559 do you want to buy it do you want to license it
7821560 does this company have a history of treating its acquisitions well and giving them room to breathe
7821561 well you know what were going to do the next project in windows
7821562 were built on this rock solid distribution its a distro you can trust but we also have got our own ideas
7821563 will i be able to find a ruby developer in 10 years
7821564 i know this software can do something really useful for me and it can almost certainly do something useful for other people as well lets free it up and see where it goes
7821565 well how can they do that this is supposed to be an open project it should be the community who decide when it is necessary to change the project leadership sure sun have every right to decide where their employees spend their paid time but should they also have the right to dictate what they do in their own time on voluntary open source projects neil reports that he and the other developers continued to work on the project as volunteers furthermore the people being kicked off the team are the ones that have got the true knowledge about that software and more importantly the community around the software
7821566 look i put 15 million into it i dont know if it will ever turn a profit im just doing it because its the right thing
7821567 well do i want to bet a piece of my infrastructure on some guys philanthropy
7821568 how much am i going to invest in this how much is it worth to my organization
7821569 ok so how much am i going to invest in the ongoing development how much am i going to contribute to the ongoing sustainability of that project and am i willing to give that money to the project
7821570 is the balance sheet right at the end of the day or do i trust a closed source company more
7821571 this is something that i really have to participate in the care and feeding of
7821572 well we can sort of take what we want from open source but we dont really have an obligation to give back
7821573 i know its free but for this you really should go for the full on support package or you should partner with red hat is that a pretty big uphill climb
7821574 since you have expended resources on customizing software to your needs why dont you just spend a little bit extra effort and resources to improve the project so you are giving back within the confines of the budget that you have available and the payback for you is that your upgrade path is easier and therefore cheaper
7821575 im getting peer review im getting recognized for my contribution et cetera
7821576 well if i could boot the os i wouldnt have to run those diagnostics
7821577 well they didnt make it available according to our terms of open source
7821578 well i love firmware and i want to tackle this and i want to move the one laptop per child platform forward in a given direction
7821579 hey did we not cover something you wish we brought up is there something unique about the subject youd want to just get on the record or just kind of a closing thought or two from your end
7821580 were finding a new owner for this code because the stuff that came in really didnt go through the things it should have it wasnt treated with same breadth of analysis that we need in order for our code to be useful to a lot of people
7821581 this is how we do it in this tiny little agile web development shop here are some things we learned about how to test how to build tools how to instrument things
7821582 how do you ensure usability in an open source project
7821583 im not going to put any data in this i want to look to see how the phishing attack works
7821584 i know better i should be able to click through
7821585 if the sites in this small list no just dont let the user through
7821586 we are going to run you out of process were going to run you in this safer way were going to give you five things you can do to the browser
7821587 hey if we want to put this feature in firefox we can find out on a pretty broad scale how people are going to react to it by getting 100 000 people to install the extension
7821588 hey last time i was running this extension crashed me youre going to have to manually re enable it if you want it to load
7821589 you can try this session again but if it was something you were looking at that crashed you i can predict whats going to happen
7821590 ah well we dont normally take that path and this extension did so thats likely whats happening here
7821591 hey this thing youre doing is breaking stuff lets get it updated
7821592 hey here is the silver bullet coveritys product scanned the code and found all the defects you fix them and you have a secure product
7821593 this could be a problem though it may not actually be one
7821594 you know that there were false positives from mozilla so were not going to bother looking at it
7821595 we covered a lot of stuff that was interesting to us but whats maybe interesting to you that we didnt specifically ask about
7821596 man it must be really daunting to come on board and write your first line of code at microsoft
7821597 no actually i need to get the performance right i need to get the security right were going to have to cut features or were going to have to slip the release or whatever in order to be able to release with quality
7821598 ok youre going to notice a change with the 2008 product where the ctps are going to be a lot more stable but a feature that you maybe heard about or are interested in is just simply not in the ctp because it just hasnt gone through all those quality gates yet
7821599 heres what were trying to achieve what changes would we have to put in place in order to be able to achieve that
7821600 well our features done but weve got all this testing to do and all our unit tests are actually broken so we dont have the code coverage but we think were done
7821601 well we have rigorous processes for checking in code too
7821602 its the voice of our users on the mailing lists and the forums
7821603 i know id love to have this feature in but were going to have to put that off or were going to have to delay it to a later ctp because i just dont really feel were hitting the quality mark
7821604 how can we do better what can we do to really improve the game here
7821605 were going to take three months out and think about this problem were going to do an mq were going to invest in our engineering were going to try and do better next time
7821606 lets take three months out and work on improving our engineering processes
7821607 where do we really want to focus peoples attention what are the mandatory things that we need to be successful that are true for everyone in the division
7821608 theres zero risk on this this thing doesnt listen on the network it doesnt parse a file it doesnt take user input no threats
7821609 oh yeah yeah i guess there is an attack vector here that we maybe wouldnt have caught if we hadnt stopped to think about it
7821610 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7821611 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7821612 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7821613 the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex
7821614 i desire you would remember the ladies and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors if particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies we are determined to foment a rebellion and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation
7821615 as to your extraordinary code of laws i cannot but laugh depend upon it we know better than to repeal our masculine systems
7821616 use every instrumentality within our power to effect our object we shall employ agents circulate tracts petition the state and national legislatures and endeavor to enlist the pulpit and press in our behalf
7821617 we will remain out of the union a hundred years rather than come in without woman suffrage
7821618 480 efforts to get state legislatures to submit suffrage amendments 277 campaigns to get state party conventions to include woman suffrage planks 47 campaigns to get state constitutional conventions to write woman suffrage into state constitutions 30 campaigns to get presidential party conventions to adopt woman suffrage planks in party platforms and 19 successive campaigns with 19 successive congresses
7821619 young suffragists who helped forge the last links of that chain were not born when it began
7821620 old suffragists who helped forge the first links were dead when it ended
7821621 i think it would be great if they could increase funding for all the sports starting now not two years down the road when its very difficult to pull off good performances
7821622 its really great to represent canada and i hope i made everyone proud
7821623 all the hard work of the past four years is worth it
7821624 just a handful of events and announcements that have occurred within hours of the huge fireworks display at the closing ceremonies in beijing they have their hearts set on the u s presidential election
7821625 the total reach of magazine web sites increased from 40 5 of the u s internet population in the second quarter of 2007 to 42 2 this year
7821626 wanton disregard of the good name of their area never mind the safety of people passing
7821627 it is very disappointing that we had a number of young people gathered last night who started to thrown stones and other missiles at passing vehicles some of which contained families and young children

7821635 initial analysis of the engine fitted to kimi raikkonens car which arrived in maranello this morning confirmed the breakage of a conrod
7821636 currently underway are further checks to try and understand what provoked the failure even if it is easy to surmise that it could be a similar problem to the one that sidelined felipe three laps from the end of the hungarian grand prix
7821637 the engineers were aware of a potential risk in general terms with the 056 engine fitted to kimis car which was on its second race given that the conrods were part of the same batch used on felipes engine
7821638 changing the engine on kimis car would have seen the finn start from far down the grid at a track where it appeared that overtaking was impossible
7821639 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races

7821676 the malays through umno were generous enough to relax the citizenship laws of this country to such extent that within 12 months of independence 90 percent who were still non citizens after nearly 100 years of colonial rule in the malay states obtained their citizenship in return for this major concession the mca and the mic agreed to continue the policy of preserving the special position of the malays while at the same time upholding the legitimate interest of other communities
7821677 this proved a less intractable problem because the leaders of the alliance realised the practical necessity of giving the malays a handicap if they were to compete on equal terms with the other races the only point of controversy was the duration of the special position should there be a time limit or should it be permanent i made a suggestion which was accepted that the question be left to the malays themselves because i felt that as more and more malays became educated and gained self confidence they themselves would do away with this special position because in itself this special position is a slur on the ability of the malays and only to be tolerated because it is necessary as a temporary measure to ensure their survival in the modern competitive world a world to which only those in the urban areas had been exposed

7821697 it may not be well known but it is not defamatory for hansard to publish a defamatory statement made under parliamentary privilege but for any other person to publish what is recorded in hansard makes that person liable
7821698 dpfs re publication is protected from defamation proceedings by qualified privilege under the defamation act
7821699 qualified privilege only arises where the publisher has some sort of duty or is in a position of responsibility which requires him to publish the defamatory statements to the person who received them a specific duty must exist it cannot be for example the general public interest duty of a journalist or blogger

7821701 hon bill english there is a fairly important issue here the member is clearly trying to stop a question being asked and i have to say that the way in which he is doing it is one i have never quite seen before but certainly it would be difficult if the house had to accept on the word of mr peters that this matter was sub judice particularly when he is often involved in court cases more than other members it could end up with the ridiculous situation where no questions could be asked because a member has said that he or she was involved in a court case if we are to go just on the members say so and some members may well be in the position where they are always involved in some kind of legal matters related to their own activities so i think we need to be pretty careful in order to make sure that a member cannot be prevented from asking a question it is one of the basic freedoms of this house
7821702 after having read this entire post i want to know was john key in the house when all this was happening
7821703 dpf doesnt come within s 13 3 d because he is not publishing a correct copy of hansard he is publishing an extract from hansard so the defence hed rely on is s 16 1 the defence of statutory qualified privilege

7821739 well i thought maybe you would like to go to that seminar on how to sell your work on the web
7821740 uh well no not really i mean i guess i can learn about that by reading something about it on the web besides i dont want to be around a bunch of people who i really dont think i am going to relate to
7821741 ok well i thought you might get something out of it and i was trying to be supportive
7821742 so if you dont want to do that i guess we can go to aarons ice cream social

7821751 now you have to be punished because you excel at something
7821752 we didnt want an escalation of the kind of tumultuous behavior caused by the coaching staff
7821753 i told him things like this happen in life and the message is dont give up stay focused and be positive
7821754 i said this is not always going to happen in life youre not always going to be number one
7821755 if you keep these kids on the field you keep them off the streets
7821756 id rather have him jericho in the midst of this controversy on the field than dealing drugs on a street corner
7821757 its really sad because its the children who are going to suffer
7821758 theres no such thing as any kid pitching too hard let him play and your kid is going to get better
7821759 a lot of these kids dont have father figures and we dont want them to end up on the streets
7821760 we want to be a resource for the family and find a place where hell be challenged and his talent can develop
7821761 i worry that there is a segment of the population that might be harder to reach average citizens who will say come on we might have a black president so we must be over it that is the danger that we declare victory
7821762 historic as this moment is it does not signify a major victory in the ongoing daily battle

7821791 at the start of the festival many were worried about the loss of venues impact of the olympics and the economy
7821792 in a difficult year with record rainfall and problems with ticketing fringe goers have come out in force and enjoyed the festival
7821793 dang i am ready for this day to be over
7821794 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7821795 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7821796 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7821797 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7821798 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7821799 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7821800 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7821801 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7821802 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7821803 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7821804 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7821805 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7821806 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7821807 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7821808 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7821809 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7821836 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7821837 the german consumer is clearly no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy

7821964 i just want to go from strength to strength with manchester city i cant see myself playing anywhere else
7821965 i have to admit in the past i havent always liked playing on the right wing but i wasnt in the team last week and i was determined to make sure i took my chance when it came
7821966 i spent the whole summer working on my fitness my strength and my game and took that into pre season so i felt ready to play
7821967 it was up to me to make sure i took my chance now i hope to make that role my own with a few more performances like that
7821968 it is difficult because i am not a winger as such in the style of say martin petrov but i tried to vary my game against west ham coming inside drifting outside and spinning to make the space for charlie vedran corluka to play me in to create the goals for elano
7821969 there is no doubt that this is a big season for me because i feel i am over that promising level and now an established player even so i didnt feel as though i was at my total best against west ham i know i can improve and do more and that i will improve with games under my belt the more i play the more relaxed i am
7821970 the result was disappointing the first week at aston villa and it was important for us to pick ourselves up and we did that

7821972 vincent kompany was brilliant on his debut he is strong good in the air and has a great range of passing he is a very good signing for us and his presence allows me to gamble a little bit and get in behind the opposition
7821973 stephen has been a bit unlucky so far to be fair i have been trying different things and i am still learning what the group can offer in various roles
7821974 he could have started last week but came in on sunday and made an impact that is what players have to do if the shirt is there to be won
7821975 players should not think that they are going to be comfortable in one role for the season they have to work hard to keep their place and stevie did his prospects no harm whatsoever
7821976 he like everyone else is working hard in training he is stronger and will get even more so we will reap the benefits of what we are doing later in the season

7821996 i keep saying over and over that the social platform race is a race to my contact list but there still isnt an effective solution i currently subscribe to salesforce com but paying 55 a month seems like a lot of money to spend on something that isnt extremely easy to use and offers 10 000 more features than ill ever use
7821997 its a deal where for a flat fee can use as much of salesforce as it cares to through 2011 unlimited users unlimited objects unlimited storage etc im guessing this is the first deal of its kind in the world imagine what you could do without limits im kind of drooling right now
7821998 ive had a couple of customers that implemented the salesforce com customer service amp support application but couldnt be convinced to decommission their old support system because they wanted to keep using their existing knowledge base salesforce coms acquisition of instranet is great news and should resolve this objection

7822014 we didnt like that idea wed been to the us and seen companies like ritual gearbox and id and to us it seemed like the game development industry was seen as better in the us people sat in cool chairs in cool offices surrounded by action figures it was nothing like the uks approach which was more like a workhouse

7822016 ja pravzaprav varno seksam samo z mojim stalnim pa ne pa saj ima ele 19 let je zdrav kot riba
7822017 sem se pred tirimi mogo e petimi leti njega pa res nisem vpra al pa saj je pred menoj imel le nekaj tipov
7822018 nikogar ne silim ampak bilo bi pametno da se testirata oba e eli lahko pride va partner z vami
7822019 hartstikke zonde wij vriesdrogen dat zulk poeder zit namelijk vol vitamine c en die eierschillen
7822020 zonde man in de usa capsuleren we dat voor anti reuma kalkpillen
7822021 wij verwerken centraal al onze gebruikte condooms tot kauwgom voor de export naar de verenigde staten sir
7822022 mijn secretaresse wil me s morgens en tijdens de lunch afzuigen maar mijn vrouw wil s avonds voor het diner en s nachts ook seks en soms voordat ik naar kantoor ga
7822023 ik word extreem duizelig de laatste weken als ik masturbeer in de auto
7822024 hoe dat nou bij die hira ratan manek kan werken
7822025 we still dont have any idea how many homes john mccain owns
7822026 and i dont begrudge him seven 10 whatever the number is but i think its an indication that he has no idea john mccain has lived the american dream but he somehow doesnt feel that that should be opened up to all americans
7822027 if you operate efficiently you both reduce waste and save money theres really no reason not to do it
7822028 batteries contain dangerous metals that arent combustible and shouldnt go in a landfill
7822029 you can buy them for 1 at bargain stores instead of using disposable juice boxes
7822030 theres a documented increase in child leukemia in homes that use pesticides on their lawn and there is an even greater incidence in homes that use them indoors
7822031 were a wasteful society and its good to make use of that waste
7822032 it will perform as well as a standard showerhead but uses less water
7822033 it will keep your home cooler and you wont need to use the air conditioning as much
7822034 dont buy kleenex thats made from 100 percent virgin trees
7822035 the only question is whether we take a page from the lord of the rings guys and try to shoot the two chapters at the same time there are two more in mind
7822036 sooner or later we all end up in the underverse
7822037 you dont want to take anyone for granted you want to let everyone know that their vote counts that you care about their issues and that youre listening
7822038 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes the military will not allow them to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7822039 if we fail this time well quit and surrender the country to them
7822040 when people dont care about us we wont have to care about them let others take over the country
7822041 i was very excited to hear that the number of international students at duke will continue to grow
7822042 it means that the campus environment will continue being enriched by the presence of people from around the world
7822043 one of her first acts in the job had been to look into reviving the series
7822044 hoped to slightly lower the average age of bbc1 viewers
7822045 plans to introduce shows aimed at younger viewers that will run in a slot after the evening news
7822046 a popular science show back to prime time for the first time since the axing of
7822047 licence payers can only hope this will actually contain some science an element sadly lacking from the moribund
7822048 hoped to slightly lower the average iq of bbc1 viewers
7822049 if mobile operators dont know what their customers are doing how on earth do they know what to charge for the broadband
7822050 their pricing plans make no sense to me i think the carriers have little or no idea of what people do with mobile broadband
7822051 the rapid growth in mobile broadband and 3g data service adoption has far reaching implications for mnos business models operators have tended to focus almost solely on providing narrowband voice and sms but the composition of their network traffic is changing
7822052 t mobile reported in april 2008 that the volume of data traffic on its network in the uk had exceeded that of voice traffic for the first time in the first quarter of 2008
7822053 mobile broadband pioneers 3 uk and vodafone are likely to announce a similar trend this year 3 uk reported a seven fold increase in the volume of data traffic on its network in the six months to march 2008
7822054 already phone users will be familiar with the network busy sign when they try to place a call at rush hour what we need to know is whether it really is better for the mnos to keep one bbc iplayer viewer going and to prevent 40 phone calls going through
7822055 how long can you survive in this market competing with the wired suppliers if your users really grow at current rates
7822056 they have just done a deal with bt on the 21cn rollout whereby they sign up early and get a good deal for at least three years and will be able to keep up with whatever users do
7822057 the new aces and storm are part of an upgrade of the student information system and retrofitting the old aces and storm into this new system would not be easy or advisable
7822058 ive always been extraordinarily proud of the old aces and my friends from home have seen me registering for classes and have been awed by it now i feel like were behind some community colleges
7822059 it really is just a matter of learning the software and then using it
7822060 we had talked to the students about a compensation for not having as simple a calendar you would be able to upload the calendar to the calendar software of your choice
7822061 that proved not to be the case for the majority of students
7822062 for a lot of students this has been a difficult transition and were trying to be responsive to that
7822063 this is the same team of people that brought them aces in the first place
7822064 we have the whole weight of a big company behind us instead of a very small team working to edit aces
7822065 theres no reason they cant make multiple interfaces of the same data instead of restricting it to one way of doing it
7822066 roberts passion for duke is totally motivating to all of us here
7822067 having the opportunity for him to work with our student athletes and allow them to glean from his experiences at duke as a student athlete and somebody who has pursued the highest level will be excellent for our program
7822068 at the time i was sitting with jordan he looked at me in great surprise and the policy was much to my astonishment as well
7822069 it truly disappoints me because as a member of campus council for three years i hold these issues very near and dear to my heart
7822070 duke has noticed a correlation between a lack of sleep and numerous health issues among students
7822071 jeffrey glass has distinguished himself as a teacher and as a scholar
7822072 his research makes him one of the most highly cited scholars of the school of engineering for his work on nanofabrication and in the institute for scientific information index for that work he has built up the master of engineering management program so hes got the experience to really help our masters programs in the other departments to grow and flourish as well
7822073 in order to implement engineering solutions engineers have to understand a basic aspect of all levels of business how to work on teams and customer needs
7822074 whereas 20 years ago they would just need to know engineering issues they now have to provide a complete solution
7822075 its so good to be on american soil and its so good to just be the duke coach
7822076 its really good being the duke coach having won the olympics
7822077 you are representing your country and trying to show respect for the world to be a part of that and win the gold medal i dont think you can get any better
7822078 there was a big duke influence in helping that culture come around
7822079 these guys behind me associate head coaches chris collins and steve wojciechowski and basketball operations director chris spatola are behind the scenes including the guy we lost to stanford johnny dawkins they work tirelessly with our team with no recognition
7822080 it was 36 years later and it was kind of a fulfillment
7822081 they were goofing around saying im going to mess up your hair
7822082 and usually you try to stay real clean and youre hugging all of those guys and by the time you went to the press conference i said i stink and i said you guys really worked hard today there were a lot of good memories
7822083 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines has been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7822084 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications of some of our customers and data from other banks were removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss of graphic data as a matter of urgency
7822085 this is the only staff ive been on where you have nine guys that can go all day and all night and recruit against anyone anywhere
7822086 kids see a lot of the players hes more or less developed they want to be a part of something special in a rebuilding process like duke
7822087 quick feet good vision and the speed to be a home run threat
7822088 hes a big bodied big framed kid with all the tangibles and intangibles
7822089 if he stays for four years hell be a four year guy duke will get at least three really good years out of him
7822090 man muss die zielgruppe kennen um die richtigen produkte aus
7822091 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
7822092 the public for the most part while they know and recognize maher arars name they dont know that there was something far more systematic going on
7822093 i believe that you cant really understand what happened to maher arar without understanding what happened to the other men
7822094 you cant argue this was a series of coincidences or mistakes when you look at all of them together
7822095 when you look at all of them together it demands accountability it demands a review of who knew what when it cant be explained away as just the americans as just coincidence as just the syrians as just mistakes it must be systematic
7822096 this resulted in the focus of the investigation moving from prosecution to more of a disruption exercise whereby the police would assist csis in dismantling a group of alleged terrorists
7822097 particularly since 9 11 we have had to accept going to a disruptive mode because prevention is the most important thing
7822098 everything we know points to these cases being an example of circumventing the normal legal processes the rule of law
7822099 the fact that theyre held in the same detention centre as so many other war on terror suspects from other countries seems to me to point to canadas role in a global diffuse and disrupt strategy we now know the extent to which the u s and cia were doing this does this point to the same strategy happening in canada yes these cases certainly do
7822100 the poster boy for csis incompetence and lax passport controls
7822101 the inquiry is about the action of canadian officials its not about how this unfolded for the men themselves and i think thats an important perspective for canadians to understand
7822102 unless the security council is restored to its preeminent position as the sole source of legitimacy on the use of force we are on a dangerous path to anarchy
7822103 nobody in the senate agrees with that there is nothing to debate he is dead flat unequivocally wrong
7822104 the work begins anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7822105 the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them
7822106 the military families who say grace each night with an empty place at the table
7822107 this time we listened to our hopes instead of our fears
7822108 we committed ourselves to building the world as it should be
7822109 please tune to sky news for an important announcement from buckingham palace
7822110 the brains of homosexual men respond more like those of women when reacting to a chemical derived from the male sex hormone
7822111 that omission sends a message that verges on the sinister not that ministers have abandoned their commitment to decency and fairness but that when it comes to devising strategies for dealing with the numbers crisis and the other challenges facing the prison estate the monitoring task has simply disappeared off the agenda
7822112 we are concerned that the government seems to be going back on jack straws own statement that we cannot build ourselves out of the prison numbers crisis
7822113 the proposal to add 7 500 in these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who at the moment we expect to keep separate from one another
7822114 for over a decade this government has failed to provide adequate jail places but huge prisoner warehouses the largest in europe are not the right answer whats needed is a network of smaller local prisons with better integration with local communities and a new focus on reducing re offending so that we can arrest the growth in the prison population in the right way
7822115 these new titan prison complexes will not be warehouses prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour
7822116 they will represent value for money for the taxpayer and best support the chances of cutting re offending by building in facilities aimed at rehabilitation
7822117 incense is sold without a warning label and given the high prevalence of use and the often involuntary nature of the exposure clarifying the role of incense smoke as a carcinogen is important from a public health perspective
7822118 it could be relevant for priests and others who are regularly exposed to incense
7822119 but im not sure if a short term effect would be measurable
7822120 if this study is confirmed i think regulation could be relevant
7822121 fight and try to bring him back at any time that the transfer window is open
7822122 cologne have never made any moves and it is particularly amusing when i keep hearing that it is fc bayern who have to make the first move
7822123 we will not say dear cologne you can have lukas podolski from us and that is 100 certain
7822124 all the signatures are on the contract there is no problem
7822125 robinhos cycle in spain has come to an end and he is looking forward to a new project
7822126 now i have returned home we will not look back anymore but forwards
7822127 i want to start again i hope that the injuries i had in recent seasons wont be repeated but here i have everything i need to do well and it depends only on me
7822128 in these two years i felt that here they loved me and they were waiting for me
7822129 i will have time to make amends and to score more goals
7822130 attempts to create ethnic conflicts instigate national secession and threaten national security
7822131 what more do they tibetans and uyghurs want the central government treats them better than us they can give birth to more than one child and their children could be admitted into universities with lower scores in the entrance exam they enjoy tax incentives and even receive subsidies from the central government what more do they want independence ask all the chinese people first
7822132 can only be an obstacle to any government effort to stabilize the situation in tibet or xinjiang
7822133 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country and not just because barack has done well but because i think people are hungry for change and i have been desperate to see our country moving in that direction and just not feeling so alone in my frustration and disappointment
7822134 were able to go on to college so i know firsthand from their lives and mine that the american dream endures
7822135 knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me that is why i love this country and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
7822136 we left corporate america which is a lot of what were asking young people to do dont go into corporate america you know become teachers work for the community be social workers be a nurse those are the careers that we need and were encouraging our young people to do that
7822137 if this is true this could represent a case of treason
7822138 the bonds are a small proportion of our assets we have always been cautious in overseas investment
7822139 if the market remains gloomy there will be more capital inflow to fixed deposits and the issuance of a 3 billion yuan bond will lift capital costs
7822140 we believe the upside potential for the loan yield is limited but think the funding cost pressure will increase in the second half of the year due to time deposit migration we remain cautious about the asset quality of loans to small enterprises credit card loans and mortgages
7822141 in the first half we closely monitored the macroeconomic situation changes streamlined our business structure and achieved good results
7822142 for the second half we will continue expanding services to small enterprises ensure the healthy development of fee and commission business and control credit risks
7822143 we do not expect the deposit growth to remain at the same level as the first six months
7822144 the increasing volatility in the financial market competition and uncertainties in the countrys monetary tightening policies will bring more challenges
7822145 russia needs to respect the territorial independence and sovereignty of georgia
7822146 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have every right to gain independence
7822147 and one of the main legal principles for recognizing independence is the fundamental principle of international law the right of people to self determination
7822148 we have more political legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia
7822149 the precedent they most like to cite is kosovo although international law is not based on precedents
7822150 there are many examples in history of both successful resolutions of secession crisis when an internal solution was found within the state and situations when this didnt work out there exists no strict regulation in international law
7822151 political factors recognition and the reaction of countries that dont accept this recognition play a determining role
7822152 neither abkhazia and i will allow myself to speak for south ossetia too nor south ossetia will ever agree to live in one state with georgia and we ask you to cross this barrier which has been so hard to cross for many years and to recognize our republics as independent states
7822153 its clearly the end of the road for gambari his role as an interlocutor is finished if he is unable to talk directly to either aung san suu kyi or junta leader than shwe
7822154 it is our job and a continuing challenge at the un to make the impossible possible and will continue my efforts at mediation regardless
7822155 nonetheless i sometimes wonder whether it is realized that if i fail and the un fails this would have negative consequences for the role of the organization in terms of mediation conflict prevention and peaceful resolution of conflicts not only in myanmar but throughout the world
7822156 asean and china have been happy to hide behind the un now they will have to take the lead to try to convince the junta to make their roadmap credible and acceptable to the region and the international community
7822157 the sg has also indicated his intention to return to myanmar when conditions are right to continue his dialogue with the myanmar leadership
7822158 shes making a point that she is no longer willing to be wheeled out like a circus act just so the regime can convey a bogus impression of dialogue
7822159 aung san suu kyi is refusing to see the un envoy before he sees a senior representative of the spdc
7822160 she feels there is no point in meeting gambari at the moment as he has nothing from the generals to report or offer
7822161 its un asian to let the envoy wait in vain for her to show up
7822162 it seems unusually rude to the extent that it gives the impression of being insensitive
7822163 myanmar claims to have a new constitution and these elections planned for 2010 will be multi party elections but what is important for us at asean is to ensure that a more credible process is taking place
7822164 why not oh wonderful mogambo master wmm when it is you who counsels that with a fiat currency it will always be possible to finance infinite amounts of spending
7822165 wall streets mortgage losses have grown so large that some firms may pay little or no taxes for years widening new york city and state deficits and challenging their ability to provide services mayor michael bloomberg said
7822166 some companies are seeking refunds from the city on taxes they prepaid saying losses have cut their tax liability to zero
7822167 the banks pay tax on 110 of earnings in advance as a safe harbor protecting against penalties for underpayment
7822168 i think it will be a number of years before wall street starts paying taxes again
7822169 defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars of existing loans underwritten by lenders around the world
7822170 the return for all institutional investment portfolios turned negative for the 12 months ended june 30
7822171 the median contraction for master trusts which includes pension plans foundations and endowments was 4 49 during the year
7822172 feds tafs and tslfs lending facilities have now dedicated over 1 6 trillion to quelling the credit crunch
7822173 honest government honest money dishonest government dishonest money worthless government worthless money
7822174 i refuse to sit back like we did in 2000 and 2004
7822175 this administration is the worst administration in american foreign policy in modern history maybe ever
7822176 rather than whine about how mean republicans are when they hit democrats on national security as so many democrats do biden has a real talent for responding with an appropriate mixture of mockery and contempt
7822177 bidens charisma and authority on the subject add a ton of firepower to obamas arsenal in this regard allowing biden to act as an extremely credible voice to deliver the message that the republican approach to foreign policy in the 21st century has been a sad sick joke
7822178 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters especially catholic ones
7822179 when i was 14 my dad beat me so i stole a hundred lira from my mothers purse and left
7822180 i hitched a lift with a lorry driver who took me to erzurum where i meant to stay but was swindled out of my money i walked for three days to artvin where i stayed for three months before paying my way to bursa after three or four years here as a washer i had enough money to move to istanbul
7822181 they came swarming over the sides of the boat like pirates
7822182 we rowed but they were angry about my littering and i was defiant about what id done so they beat me up of course they were right but i was too ignorant at the time to think about my actions or their consequences
7822183 i had bought some chain and was getting ready to chain myself to the railing when some russians ran up and tried to beat me i left but knew something had to be done the animals were sick with fungus and stressed by the unfamiliar sea water and marina noise
7822184 by the third or fourth day i was weak and becoming delirious i was only drinking water or tea and smoking cigarettes
7822185 the police came to try and take me away but tourists stopped them they even had candle lit vigils to support me
7822186 it was the little finger of my right hand which as you can see is a little crippled anyway
7822187 they were using the environment to garner popularity and kudos for themselves not because they actually cared
7822188 i dont believe in technology it will bring the destruction of the world look at marmaris nature was in balance here for hundreds of years but in the last 25 its grown out of all recognition there are too many buildings too much destruction of the natural world
7822189 my actions may seem over the top but if i dont commit myself body and soul no one takes any notice
7822190 im not tired of what i do though i live for it and get pleasure from it
7822191 its a little discouraging but i suppose its something we have to expect in a way because we will be constantly shocked with credit worries
7822192 the banks have pretty well lost so much capacity to finance economic growth the whole question about progressing is a little up in the air at the same time the central banks cant do much about it because inflation has accelerated from targets the market is caught in a trap
7822193 against this kind of background its going to be difficult for the equity market to make any progress
7822194 met de lancering van de werd in juli van dit jaar ook de rabo sport gadget ge ntroduceerd in drie verschillende uitvoeringen voor elke sport n in de eerste release was het mogelijk om je de videos van rabo sport op je eigen hyvesprofiel te krijgen deze week introduceert rabobank de uitbreiding ten opzichte van release 1 vanaf nu is het voor iedere sportfan mogelijk om een eigen sportkanaal aan te maken binnen de gadget je kunt nu uitzendingen maken die bestaan uit een of meerdere filmpjes via de gadget kun je heel eenvoudig switchen tussen de twee kanalen rabo sport en het eigen gebruikerskanaal zo kunnen je vrienden op je hyvesprofiel genieten van jouw meest recente sportvideos
7822195 rabobank is de grootste sportsponsor van nederland zij sponsort de sporten hockey paardensport en wielrennen behalve het eigen sportplatform www rabosport nl heeft rabobank ook gekozen voor een strategie om relevant aanwezig te zijn op populaire nieuwssites en sociale netwerken zo heeft rabobank als eerste adverteerder van nederland ge nvesteerd in een branded channel op youtube en lopen er momenteel pilots met brabants dagblad en ilse media nu video sinds deze zomer is er ook een door de gadget open te stellen voor de eigen filmpjes van gebruikers wordt de gadget persoonlijk gemaakt het is voor het eerst in nederland dat gebruikers binnen hyves een eigen sportkanaal kunnen maken

7822198 de is ontwikkeld in opdracht van het rabo tv programma van rabobank nederland door creatie productie techniek amp project management brevidius techniek amp hosting en qnh interactive ontwikkeling begeleiding en testen
7822199 opening an office in poland is a strategic decision for ubisoft
7822200 our vision is to ensure our presence in the most important markets and that we remain close to our consumers the eastern europe market has the potential to become a key market for video games and poland represents a major part of this potential with a rapidly growing console install base
7822201 product development is where we have the greatest impact on the environment growing demand for our products across the world which increasingly include more advanced and power hungry applications means this is at the heart of our strategy
7822202 pace has always supported the energy efficiency criteria it argued often as a lone voice as being technically and commercially practicable by annually delivering product meeting and surpassing the european commission code of conduct stb criteria and other international energy efficiency endorsement standards
7822203 i always thought that brain drill was one of the most brutal bands in the death metal scene and now i am extremely excited to be part of that band and i am even more amped to be able to start playing shows and work on our new material
7822204 it has become clear in the last few weeks that a significant number of national associations have decided to move the closure of their window to midnight monday september 1 in order to avoid any possible problems that may arise through the deadline falling upon a weekend
7822205 among those who have changed to september 1 are england germany italy and the netherlands
7822206 this being the case it would seem in this instance to make sense to bring the closure of our transfer window into line with these national associations in order to assist our clubs and ensure that they are not disadvantaged in any way when trying to sign players prior to the deadline
7822207 there are however still some associations who are closing their window at midnight on sunday august 31 and accordingly the association will make arrangements to have registrations department cover on august 31 as well as september 1 to deal with all enquiries

7822215 hey i fight against israel they will give you a hug and a kiss
7822216 hes the same man who drove me and our new baby daughter home from the hospital 10 years ago this summer
7822217 inching along at a snails pace peering anxiously at us in the rearview mirror feeling the whole weight of her future in his hands he was determined to give her what he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7822218 after all thats happened these past 19 months see the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7822219 to commit to memory every single episode of the brady bunch
7822220 im really excited about all of us emulating her not only in her style but in her grace

7822223 the mother was egging it on telling her child to hit the other child
7822224 i tried to explain to the kids thats not how you settle disputes
7822225 all i thought was self defense i would never let my kids be bullies thats not acceptable in my home
7822226 its not only against the law its a bad message to send to children to encourage them to fight
7822227 the police didnt bother to talk to none of the neighbors on this side of the street or nobody else
7822228 i would die for my children i would stand at the gates of hell for my children
7822229 i even went to jail for my child but im not going to let the neighborhood kids hurt him
7822230 apparently an individual was on the outside of the vehicle and fell off the vehicle at some point in time
7822231 shortly after the individual fell off the car he was transported to the hospital and was pronounced dead

7822234 hey singing with a husky cold induced voice might actually be
7822235 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7822236 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7822237 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7822238 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7822239 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7822240 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7822241 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7822242 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said

7822244 if a new president and congress consider changes to the drug benefit it will be important to keep in mind that the coverage gap has consequences for some patients with serious health conditions
7822245 we urge beneficiaries to choose wisely when selecting their drug coverage
7822246 again we emphasize that any changes to the coverage gap would need to come from congress

7822253 on every metric this campaign has operated on a scale that has exceeded what was done before
7822254 you could go online and download the names addresses and phone numbers of 100 people in your neighborhood to get out and vote or the 40 people on your block who were undecided
7822255 here is the leaflet print it out and get it to them it was you at your computer in your house printing and downloading they did it all very well
7822256 the key networking advance in the obama field operation was really deploying community building tools in a smart way from the very beginning
7822257 when the campaign ended we thought howard dean was not destined to be president but what we are doing online this is too big to let go away
7822258 we developed all the tools the obama campaign is using sms text messaging phone tools web capacity
7822259 they blue state digital did a lot of nice work in taking this crude set of unrelated applications and making a complete suite
7822260 we made some projections of traffic levels contribution amounts and e mail levels based on estimates from folks who worked with john kerry and dean in 2004
7822261 we were watching the traffic go up and up surpassing all our previous records
7822262 so we had to do a lot of work to make sure we kept up with the demand his online success had placed on the system
7822263 the campaign consciously or unconsciously became much more of a media operation than simply a presidential campaign because they recognized that by putting their message out onto these various platforms their supporters would spread it for them
7822264 we are going from the era of the sound bite to the sound blast
7822265 they have done a great job in being precise in the use of the tools
7822266 in iowa it was house parties looking for a highly committed local network in south carolina it was a massive get out the vote effort
7822267 we provided the tools remote training and opportunity for supporters to build the campaign on their own
7822268 when the campaign eventually did deploy staff to these states they supplemented an already built infrastructure and volunteer network
7822269 millions of phone calls were made to early primary states by people who used the website to reach out and connect with them
7822270 on every metric this campaign has operated on a scale that has exceeded what has been done before we facilitate actions of every sort sending e mails out to millions and millions of people organizing tens of thousands of events
7822271 but the point of the campaign is to get someone to donate money make calls write letters organize a house party the core of the software is having those links to taking action to doing something
7822272 they the obama supporters are chanting yes we can and shes saying i dont need you
7822273 that is what the top of that campaign said by celebrating terry mcauliffe the veteran political operative and former democratic national committee chairman and how many millions he could put together with big big checks she doesnt need my 25
7822274 if there is a difference in how the two campaigns approached a web strategy a lot of those differences were based on our constituencies
7822275 we were reaching a different demographic of supporters and used our tools accordingly
7822276 have all the smartest bottom up tech savvy people working for you
7822277 if the candidate and the top of the campaign want to run a top down campaign there is nothing you can do it will sit there and nothing will happen thats kind of what happened with the clinton campaign
7822278 we saw all this money funding a blimp and thought we really need this money for commercials
7822279 his social networking site was poorly done and people found there was nothing to do on it
7822280 it was very insular a walled garden you dont want to keep people inside your walled garden you want them to spread the message to new people
7822281 you have an entire generation of folks under age 25 no longer using e mails not even using facebook a majority are using text messaging
7822282 i get obamas text messages and every one is exactly what it should be it is never pointless it is always worth reading and it has an action for you to take you can have hundreds of recipients on a text message you have hundreds of people trying to change the world in 160 characters or less whats the sms strategy for john mccain none
7822283 it gives a hipper younger perspective on the campaign and makes both of her parents seem hipper and younger
7822284 what we will see is that the mccain online campaign is using the internet just as effectively to meet its goals as the obama campaign
7822285 the more contextual information they can provide the field operation the better turnout they will have
7822286 its certain that the relationships that have been built between barack obama and his supporters and between supporters themselves will not end on election day
7822287 were all excited because hes got one million people signed up but we are 300 million people in this country we are still at the infancy stages of what social networking technologies are going to do not just in our politics but in everything there wont be any campaign in 2012 that doesnt try to build a social network around it
7822288 the thing they the obama camp dont quite recognize is how much of their enormous support comes from the perception that this is someone different
7822289 if they behave like everyone else how much will that stanch the passion of his support
7822290 open my house to strangers and really get something going
7822291 im e mailing people i havent seen in 20 years we have this tremendous ability to use this technology to network with people why dont we use it
7822292 it will be interesting to see what develops after this party because now im connected to all these people

7822298 it will be the inauguration of the new opera house and i hope to go down to see it before i actually arrive to do the show
7822299 the dynamic will be different than last year i would like to think that i have good experience as a presenter so i am bringing that to the table
7822300 we are going to be keeping a lot of what was good about the show last year i think people will get a really good insight into what we are like together
7822301 i think the casting of s le and gr inne is a stroke of genius
7822302 i think theres a real sexual frisson there for men thats very clever and im looking forward to seeing how that works out
7822303 smiles are always free and be grateful to ur life
7822304 hes my life if you damage him you damage me the whole street loves him hes really active and a healthy boy
7822305 its a big shock to the family it has hit the mother especially hard she was in shock and hasnt eaten since it happened and the father was all over the place
7822306 he didnt know the kids were going to be there at the time
7822307 i dont like the guns but they have gone now if they havent gone i will make sure
7822308 she knows where are all the bodies have been buried in the past 30 or so years of chicago politics and she knows all the tricks
7822309 if obama had a political and financial godmother it would be valerie
7822310 jarrett has done that for barack and michelle three or four times over
7822311 i ask all the protesters who have been blockading or occupying government offices that you still have a chance to withdraw and go back to your homes the military will not allow them to take control of the country however it is not the time yet for military force
7822312 if we fail this time well quit and surrender the country to them
7822313 when people dont care about us we wont have to care about them let others take over the country
7822314 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7822315 he has still got to get to the meat and potato blue collar workers
7822316 some kind of roll call but not all the states
7822317 then in november i expect to vote for the democratic party nominee because i am a good democrat
7822318 i really only know one person in new mexico who has said he will not vote for obama
7822319 disappointed that obama didnt pick hillary as his running mate
7822320 i have been a friend of hillarys for a very long time i joined her fan club four years ago i will vote for hillary here this week and then i will support obama i dont want to but i will i dont think he has been very respectful to hillary
7822321 if you dont need that check send it to somebody who does
7822322 smiles are always free and be grateful to ur life
7822323 the main driver of demand for our products is urbanization and industrialization in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7822324 instead they are an obvious attempt to smear the senators character
7822325 the utter illogic of the governments position reveals what is really going on
7822326 the government wishes to smuggle in suggestions of bribery and corruption that it has not charged and cannot prove the indictment alleges no quid pro quo for any gifts sen stevens allegedly received but the government now asks permission to introduce evidence of official actions in order to invite the jury baselessly to infer just such a quid pro quo
7822327 the negative consequences flowing from such disclosure particularly during a time frame when the defendant had been engaged in performing official acts for veco and bill allen
7822328 would have subjected himself to public scrutiny and criticism regarding his ongoing relationship with veco and bill allen and the fact that he was laboring under a conflict of interest
7822329 most importantly disclosure of the things of value and the negative repercussions flowing from that disclosure would have threatened the defendants future stream of things of value from veco bill allen and others
7822330 cannot credibly claim that he cannot understand the charges or prepare his defense
7822331 where the indictment charges that stevens received things of value at the girdwood residence the indictment specifically notes that the renovation work included jacking up and resting the house on stilts building a new first floor with two bedrooms and a bathroom renovating the existing residence and adding a garage with workshop and a second story wraparound deck
7822332 each and every detail of how the case will be proved
7822333 the prosecutors who were involved in the grand jury proceedings are not aware of any evidence introduced to the grand jury that reflects an act taken by stevens such as bills or statements on the floor of the senate that would be considered protected legislative activity
7822334 it involves enforcement of an unambiguous rule contained in the criminal law do not lie when required by law to provide honest disclosure of assets
7822335 is a misguided attempt to impugn sen stevens and his family before the jury
7822336 if they know you have legal advice they will be more careful
7822337 all i want is you all i crave is you
7822338 i bet a lot of people wonder why the house of prayer movement does what it does
7822339 players can now find a facility and get a really good idea of what its like before they ever go there we think users are going to love it because it removes a lot of the worry about what youll find when you arrive at the facility were also giving facility owners the ability to go in and edit their facility profile so they can be sure that the information online is always accurate its a true win win
7822340 ive taken a lot of c p over this photo i really dont need this s t
7822341 evidence we have to date indicates that the photograph was taken over a year ago in the prison kitchen where the prisoner worked and the knife itself was a kitchen knife
7822342 we already have a rolling programme of security reviews within the prison system and in this context we will shortly be conducting a full security audit of the dochas centre
7822343 we have made our appeal to fifa it is in their hands now and we await their response but if they decide that we must play ireland outside of georgia we would look to play the game in karlsruhe

7822350 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7822351 they were all picking up bottles throwing bottles throwing bits of stones throwing anything at the police they possibly could
7822352 i saw police with blood on their faces i saw police getting carried away i saw people who were throwing missiles getting carried away because they were getting batoned as well
7822353 its ironic that just as regulators are breaking up one monopoly baa british airways and american airlines are trying to create another our results prove that consumers want choice on transatlantic routes
7822354 it would be crass stupidity to claim that what is likely to be proposed in this deal would not have some possible detrimental affect on virgin

7822369 this song is great fun and good for western swing dancing
7822370 but it also contains a bit of a message for folks who may often burn the candle at both ends
7822371 receiving this regulatory certification is a major accomplishment in diagnocures growth strategy which will strengthen our leadership position in high value molecular cancer diagnostics we can now provide clinicians and patients with a test using a technology that is 100 000 fold more sensitive than the current method of staging we can help answer the fundamental question that every colorectal cancer patient asks after their surgery am i cured or has my cancer spread
7822372 it seems clear to me that the mpla will retain or increase its majority in parliament
7822373 10 reasons why people should vote for the ruling mpla party
7822374 there is a clear violation of angolan law that prohibits the government from promoting itself through the state owned media
7822375 in the end the mpla will have a lot more air time than all the other parties as a whole and this will obviously influence the final result of the election
7822376 but the angolan people are smart enough to read between the lines they know that life isnt as pink as what the government portrays on television
7822377 the mpla is using all the government means available including military airplanes helicopters boats and trucks to carry out its propaganda
7822378 on top of that it also uses up most of our time during television and radio newscasts
7822379 die gro e vielfalt der eingereichten internationalen und origin ren virals zeigt uns die weltweite bedeutung dieser besonderen art von kurzfilm

7822466 we know it wont always be smooth sailing the more difficult the circumstances the more we must remember the important commitments made by each party and abide by a spirit of mutual respect in encouraging mutual confidence

7822599 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics
7822600 we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7822601 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7822602 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery
7822603 because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7822604 kalau tentang kpk kami tidak mau komentar saya tahu memang masih banyak yang harus diperbaiki tapi kalau dipersoalkan masih ada atau tidak mungkin ada mungkin juga tidak disini perlunya temuannya apa

7822611 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7822612 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
7822613 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
7822614 it should hasten its efforts to join but that is obviously an issue for russia there are a number of stumbling blocks but these can be overcome with the right political will

7822625 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7822626 these are things that we can do right now for the customer
7822627 they may have been changes that we would have made but not necessarily as quickly as we are doing now
7822628 hondas been a fuel economy leader for an entire generation because we bake in good fuel economy at the design stage
7822629 we just really paid attention to detail in fuel economy
7822630 all these little things you start to get a half percent here a percent here you add these up its that attention to detail thats whats given some of our competitors in the past the japanese an advantage
7822631 weve combined all that were going to overtake them or equal them
7822632 the deal is about to be reached robinhos cycle in spain has come to an end and he is looking forward to a new project
7822633 der bildungsmonitor ist f r mich ein ansporn unsere schulen weiter zu verbessern

7822637 wenn man die zw lf positiven tests von sydney und die 26 von athen heranzieht h tte es mathematisch gesehen in peking 30 bis 40 f lle geben m ssen es sind aber nur sechs
7822638 wir haben weniger f lle weil der abschreckungseffekt gr er und es schwieriger geworden ist zu dopen es freut mich dass die mehrheit der athleten sauber gek mpft hat
7822639 wir haben die internationalen verb nde angehalten vor den spielen verst rkt zu kontrollieren
7822640 in sydney war der abstand zwischen doping betr gern und anti doping k mpfern wahrscheinlich so gro wie nie
7822641 mir wurde von den experten gesagt dass es im moment nichts gibt das genutzt wird und uns nicht bekannt ist
7822642 in den vergangenen vier jahren haben wir einen signifikanten sprung nach vorn gemacht
7822643 ich denke wir k nnen den betrug niemals stoppen aber ich denke 99 9 prozent der sportler sind sauber
7822644 ich bin berzeugt dass eine neue generation von sportlern heranw chst und dass die generation die systematisch gedopt hat ausstirbt
7822645 die russin kommt aus einer trainingsgruppe wo die h lfte gedopt ist
7822646 man darf nicht vergessen dass phelps und bolt ausnahmeathleten sind skepsis ja verdacht nein

7822656 the roster service is able to operate without legal interference because we do not associate our file with any logos or other type of insignia
7822657 what we do is similar to somebody doing the legwork on a very detailed depth chart for all the fbs teams and then selling this data file to a college football preseason magazine we only sell a data file which is why it works
7822658 ea put this feature into the game knowing this was going to happen
7822659 and even though they say they do not condone making accurate rosters this is why many people purchase this game as they can become familiar with the big stars in college football this year

7822696 theres a real genuine feel of disappointment by our athletes
7822697 hopefully that will fuel them for the future to great success
7822698 because these guys wanted medals they didnt come here to play
7822699 but obviously we have to go back and figure that out
7822700 since were that close its going to give us hope for the future 2012 should be exciting
7822701 i had a loving husband i had a loving son and they loved each other they were friends they were buddies its just this horrible illness i dont know what goes through peoples heads
7822702 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
7822703 we need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins when those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position
7822704 the consumer climate was depressed further by the very subdued economic outlook even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7822705 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7822706 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7822707 the german consumer is clearly no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7822708 high energy prices are reducing the purchasing power of consumers with manufacturing and wholesale prices rocketing most recently there is little hope of an easing in the price trend of other fast moving consumer goods
7822709 real disposable income for consumption will therefore hardly see an increase this year

7822716 so then you and all of our group is part of the problem of judaism
7822717 wanting to do it right so a man does kiddush and a woman will light candles
7822718 do you want to do a halachic kabbalat shabbat with all of the zmirot and prayers and choreography
7822719 no no no david its too much for this group but we should at least teach them that men make kiddush and bless the challah women light candles
7822720 i will truly miss the girls but this has been a vision of mine for the last seven years and its finally going to the big screen

7822723 the old synagogue was here then the christians tore it down and put up holy cross church and so the square is called holy cross church lets move on
7822724 for me the renaming of the site of the old synagogue as holy cross square is christianitys ultimate act of violent domination
7822725 david you know that square back there where the synagogue used to be well we were just thinking that maybe as a davai group we could work with the city of seville to put up some kind of memorial in the square to the medieval jewish community of seville
7822726 the way that he gets here to the democratic nomination change is not how he gets there to the white house

7822738 apart from taurine efsa will also be evaluating glucuronolactone as constituents of possibly by the end of 2008
7822739 its the video very hot haan my god i dont even know why shes sherlyns linking me with a hot hot thing shes trying to change her image maybe with my name if shes doing this poor thing i wish her success for all those who see nudity will be happy but my name is hema malini and that wont change for anything
7822740 ive known hemaji as a wonderful person and if she says sherlyn is promoting nudity in her name i dare not contest her opinion after all the video did receive 19 cuts from the censor board if sherlyn has a diva like image she cant help it you cant ask a madonna to be like an alka yagnik can you
7822741 see sherlyn made this video as a tribute to hemajis dard hemajis dus numbri released in1976 so her dard is of that era sherlyns dard is of todays times which is felt by everyone whos young we all know that this dard is a bit emotional and a bit sexual too

7822743 kartu kuning pertama bisa diterima tapi anda seharusnya tak mendapat kartu kuning kedua seperti itu dan mark harus bisa bisa belajar mengerti hal tersebut itu akan bisa berdampak baik untuk dirinya dan juga tim
7822744 yang penting adalah dia sadar kalau sudah bikin kesalahan tapi saya pikir dia tahu kalau dia sudah bikin anggota tim lainnya jadi kerepotan
7822745 van bommel adalah karakter yang cepat naik darah dan tak bisa mengontrol dirinya sendiri sehingga dia sama sekali tak membantu dirinya sendiri atau tim dia harus belajar mengontrol dirinya sendiri

7822748 the idea to make a film on black magic came from india tv the channel keeps on showing various programmes on black magic i watched various programmes on black magic and super natural powers on the channel and approached azam khan with the concept he liked it and the whole script was written
7822749 i dont know what makes a film hit otherwise i wouldnt have made flops
7822750 phoonk doesnt have any big stars still it is a hit this shows that concept film is now being accepted in india
7822751 people in india identify a film by the presence of stars
7822752 we are planning a sequel to the film which will have a link from the point where it ended varma will be directing it and almost the entire cast will be repeated in the sequel titled phoonk 2
7822753 i am generally pleased that the media in sabah has done a very good job bringing significant and important news to society especially in areas that matters such as profiling the state governments development agenda namely the halatuju and sabah development corridor as well as plans and programmes for the state under the ninth malaysian plan
7822754 you have an important role to play in terms of informing the people of the governments objectives and measures taken to achieve them
7822755 this is especially relevant now in this information age where access to information has never been so easy a discerning society will no longer just accept what is being brought to them but they look for intelligent reports that go beyond mere reporting
7822756 in short readers are increasingly looking for substance in news
7822757 you must strive to make the significant interesting and relevant journalists must continually ask what information has value to citizens and in what form
7822758 i know there is the general perception that bad news or sensationalism sells like hot cakes it is rather unfortunate that some revel in the misfortunes that have befallen others
7822759 nonetheless i trust the media in sabah will continue to uphold the strong fundamentals of journalism which is accurate and fair reporting
7822760 china believes all countries while adhering to their international obligations of nuclear non proliferation have the right of peaceful use of nuclear energy and to carry out international cooperation in this regard
7822761 meanwhile relevant cooperation should be conducive to the integrity and effectiveness of maintaining the international non proliferation regime
7822762 will consider soon a step to restore the nuclear facilities in yongbyon to their original state
7822763 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7822764 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7822765 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7822766 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7822767 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
7822768 will work closely with relevant countries to have north korea resume the disablement work as early as possible
7822769 he had a library of cloud formations but thats where the artistic side of it comes in he created these beautiful images he was definitely very dedicated even after he was injured and he shouldnt have been flying at all
7822770 this photograph is particularly rare because its signed at the bottom there are other versions around but not many have the photographers signature i think it will appeal to all sorts of people its such a collectable image of edinburgh
7822771 one cannot get successful photographs whilst sitting in the cockpit for ones arms would almost certainly come into contact with the vibrating side of the aeroplane
7822772 its not a complete set but they are autographed and in good condition in the slip case
7822773 he used to do this kind of work before he became a famous stand up its a great poem its really funny its come directly from the family that held it and the provenance is definitely going to help it in the sale
7822774 i hope the money will be used to stop abuse towards the street children
7822775 i really wanted to see russia because i went to a russian school
7822776 i think it was difficult for isla to see the street children in ethiopia
7822777 we used to see them hanging around at street junctions selling paper tissues and we talked to one girl in particular about herself and her family
7822778 it made us realise that we all live in the same world but really were living on different planets
7822779 i think isla is mature for her age but perhaps a lot of that is to do with living in a foreign country and going to a foreign school and being exposed to things that most children wouldnt be exposed to
7822780 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7822781 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7822782 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 23 30 local french time
7822783 all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of ear ache
7822784 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7822785 i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7822786 it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7822787 its basically inevitable that the school will close given that the school roll is 32
7822788 this is what they have been trying to get all along
7822789 practically all the p7s turned out for their final year but most of the pupils in the other classes have found somewhere else its a real shame not just for bonnington but for all the schools that are up for closure
7822790 this is the education departments fault edinburgh city council has made a conscious decision to scaremonger so that this would happen
7822791 parents have been frightened off by all the rumours and they will see the school roll has dramatically fallen and use it against us
7822792 the parents all said that they didnt want to take the children out the school and would come back if they were given something concrete
7822793 the parents are quite strong and want to stand up against these plans
7822794 im quite pleased to say that parents are sticking by the school
7822795 where there are places available parents are free to choose where they send their children to school
7822796 we appreciate that this is a difficult time but no decisions have been taken regarding these proposals the situation regarding the pupil numbers is currently being assessed at the schools
7822797 my mind was filled with thoughts of thirst and to avoid thinking about it i counted from one to 12 i did it thousands of times
7822798 i thought a lot about roger and my family my life i looked at my watch all the time and thought ive lived another hour
7822799 neighbours came to bring me food and to sit with me the third day i lost hope but they told me not to
7822800 i was in such a state i thought it was a joke when they called to say they found her
7822801 in between bills theres no contact at all from the factors so they dont tell you that theyre going to be doing work or ask if we want anything done
7822802 on this bill up pops 907 32 for clearing the gutters but you dont know that the gutters have been cleaned so you dont know to budget for it the gutters are well above any tree line and its not a leafy area anyway
7822803 the stairs are always the same and sometimes they take 220 for stair cleaning and sometimes its 280 it makes me angry because its not them thats footing the bill
7822804 our research has shown that communications between property managers and the people they serve are often poor
7822805 too many people are going through unnecessary stress because theyre either in dispute with their property managers or arent being told whats going on
7822806 this is not an isolated case the number of householders unhappy with so many different property management firms led us to take our concerns to the office of fair trading in the meantime the scottish government is developing an accreditation scheme to raise industry standards
7822807 the clients should know that theres gutter clearing carried out annually at the property which is all part of good maintenance an annual inspection of the roof anchor is also part of health and safety guidance
7822808 other smaller repairs would be things that the residents themselves will have asked for our factoring fee actually only increased by 1 50 a quarter in february
7822809 we have to act on behalf of what we see to be in their best interests in the absence of specific instructions
7822810 by all means we would love to get together with the owners and find out what were not doing for them which we could be
7822811 we had asked for planning permission for this more than a year ago and when we later contacted the planning department to see what was happening we were told to go ahead with the work and to keep the original fittings
7822812 that is what we have done but i am stunned that they want us to reinstate this stair it is literally a stairway to nothing and in reality it is just a tripping hazard for staff which is why we wanted to do something about it
7822813 we will need to wait for a decision but we may appeal
7822814 the removal of a section of original railings and banister has compromised the appearance and the architectural integrity of the historic staircase
7822815 the unsympathetic removal of original and historically significant architectural features is contrary to policies on listed buildings and has a detrimental effect on the buildings internal character and appearance
7822816 i saw it as a chance to get involved in the sport again and raise money for a really great cause and edinburgh seemed like a natural base for it
7822817 when debbie died from cancer my friends and my rugby team were a tremendous support its amazing what the rugby community is like at times like those i was getting messages of support from around the world
7822818 i thought about it and in april this year began sending a few e mails out and it grew from there
7822819 now we have a pool of around 50 players from all over the nature of going on tour means everyone has to fund it from their own pocket and because of work commitments not everyone can make it all the time
7822820 but it ensures we can always call on 15 to 20 guys to join up with us weve already had e mails from teams in the czech republic who want to hear from us and even in japan as well
7822821 i chose cancer research uk because they put the money you raise to really good use
7822822 it is a great opportunity for them to realise that through sport they can raise significant funds it is a marvellous initiative
7822823 generous sponsors have provided johns team with rugby kit and prizes for the draw they have even had their own kilts designed and a unique tartan registered to them
7822824 their efforts will help us raise more funds and awareness to help us beat cancer in scotland

7822855 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7822856 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7822857 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7822858 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration

7822862 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7822863 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7822864 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7822865 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7822866 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7822867 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7822868 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7822869 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7822870 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7822871 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7822872 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not

7822880 we built our homes out of palm leaves i saw animals id never seen before he taught me the medicinal properties of all the plants we picked fruit off the trees we swam with and ate piranhas and of course we had sex for almost two weeks
7822881 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7822882 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7822883 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7822884 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7822885 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request

7822892 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7822893 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7822894 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7822895 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7822896 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7822897 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7822898 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7822899 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7822900 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7822901 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7822902 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7822903 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7822904 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7822905 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7822906 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7822907 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7822908 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7822909 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7822910 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7822911 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7822912 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7822913 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7822914 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7823004 certain writers have a style that can be best likened to body odor irresistible to some obnoxious to many and apparently imperceptible to the writer himself therouxs lack of self awareness his failure to observe the basic hygiene of modesty is compelling in its way after reading the auto hagiography of the turkmen leader niyazov theroux summarizes it as pages and pages most of it self reverential he could be writing a press release for his own book

7823007 all fears to the contrary however american wife is no hatchet job no gossipy kitty kelley bio in disguise nor is it hagiography or the sort of seamy political pulp fiction in which denizens of the capitol have been known to dabble rather it is an intelligent well crafted psychologically astute novel that granted will anger the overly literal and the easily outraged but such people are unlikely to be eager readers of contemporary fiction this book is for those of us who are
7823008 murray bail plays a laconic self concealing game cunningly luring the reader in to his interlinked stories the pages is not an easy or open book but it is an oddly compelling one the spell is most powerfully cast in which can make the world come alive on the page after all perhaps it is fiction that does best what this philosopher is trying for to grasp what he saw before him ordinary objects to fit words only to what can be seen

7823017 your training sessions seem to be paying off mr delmar
7823018 now aries i will have to ask you to go outside for now while i talk to your father about some important business can you do that
7823019 now i think it is about time we talked about aries
7823020 i know you have taken an interest in him spencer what do you want with him
7823021 now what was it that you wanted to ask me
7823022 as you can imagine my company has been on the rise ever since its establishment six years ago well i could use as any intelligent and physically able man to come work for me yours youve been working on for a while and i know youve been trying to impress me with how well hes grown
7823023 i was merely doing what a father should do it was too much of a risk to enroll him in public school theres no telling who could find out that i was a former nazi it hasnt been that long ago
7823024 either way i think it is about high time that you hand him over hes old enough that he does not require a parenting figure anymore especially one of your caliber
7823025 you will not judge me on how i raise my child ozwell i raise him how i wish and there is nothing you can say or do about that
7823026 do you really think he wants to stay here emm do you really think he loves you and respects you no he doesnt and sooner or later he will be old enough to take his revenge on you for killing his mother
7823027 yes he has told me all about it how you murdered her and what happened on this very day six years ago how you forced him onto his dead mother wiping his face in her own blood oh yes i know and i also know that he still remembers very clearly i can hear the hate in his voice when he speaks of you sooner or later he will kill you
7823028 of course he would tell you such things its his imagination my wife left me she did not die
7823029 i think i would rather believe a boy who seems to have more logic then an insane fool who is too paranoid to do anything right
7823030 fine but not yet you will not have him until he is ready
7823031 i will have him i will make sure of that
7823032 i know how hard it must be to lose such a loved one such as her your father should have never done such a thing he was stupid to have done so it is too bad someone can not put him in his place he is after all very week now im sure even a young boy could put him down and teach him a lesson
7823033 i would like you to come live with me if your father will allow it im sure you would like it there
7823034 youll have to somehow convince him to let you though it is not within my power to take you directly from him well not by any means legal can i take you
7823035 i shall see you on my next visit aries and if you ever need help dont be afraid to call me

7823051 besides china brazil is the beautiful lady in the party when we talk about emerging markets
7823052 there was a retailer in one of the countries that sold their systems with linux
7823053 they made a survey of clients within the first 30 days 95 percent were already on windows
7823054 it was very difficult to find venture capital to use it to develop new companies this has been changing
7823055 venture capitalists are starting to come not only from outside brazil to brazil but even inside brazil there have been groups forming
7823056 they are new for brazil and they are designed in brazil
7823057 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7823058 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7823059 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7823060 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7823061 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7823062 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7823063 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7823064 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7823065 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7823066 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7823067 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7823068 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7823069 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later
7823070 one of the things i know i want to do is write a theme that will permeate throughout the entire work that will somehow be a universal theme how im going to depict that musically im not sure yet
7823071 when we started the glast project we wanted to find ways to communicate not only the science results to a broad audience but also tell the story of how the observatory was built by an extraordinary international team of scientists and engineers
7823072 the prelude effectively communicates the excitement of building and launching the observatory and provides a glimpse of what glast may see in the high energy universe
7823073 the idea is to get people excited about science at a time when there are lots and lots of budget cuts for science and research at a lot of institutions including stanford
7823074 the more the public is interested in science the better it is going to be so much of what we can be grateful for comes out of cutting edge science research
7823075 i found myself really falling in love with science and with the science behind glast in terms of particle physics cosmology and astronomy
7823076 so its been an eye opener for me as well that these two paradigms are so compatible
7823077 the beauty of this satellite in orbit i really wanted to capture that
7823078 the idea is that it will be a little bit of peter and the wolf meets gustav holsts the planets prokofievs peter and the wolf is a story with the depiction of the story in music with the orchestra theres a section of text which is read and music follows that and sonically depicts what is spoken occasionally there is text under the music

7823102 airports and associated activities consume large amounts of energy the energy used to heat cool and light airports makes a huge carbon footprint
7823103 reducing airport carbon emissions means minimising energy from renewable sources and if necessary using carbon offsetting schemes that compensate for emissions by investing in projects that create carbon savings elsewhere such as wind farms

7823172 vandaag de dag is de zon nog even inactief als twee jaar geleden en niemand heeft een verklaring
7823173 niemand weet de oorzaak van het langdurige activiteitsminimum in de zeventiende eeuw een herhaling is zeker niet uitgesloten daarvoor kennen we de zon nog niet goed genoeg pas als deze situatie nog zes maanden aanhoudt ga ik in die richting denken
7823174 de lengte van het huidige zonneminimum valt binnen de historische normen de tweede helft van de twintigste eeuw was de zon zeer actief maar aan het begin van de twintigste eeuw zijn er minima geweest die langer hebben geduurd soms bijna twee keer zo lang het is goed mogelijk dat er nog veel dagen zonder zonnevlekken zullen komen misschien wel honderden maar dat er opnieuw een maximum aan zit te komen staat voor mij vast

7823216 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7823217 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7823218 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7823219 at the moment it is probably likely that he will start off chasing but not definite
7823220 this was inappropriate and foolhardy behaviour at the end of a long campaign
7823221 all three swimmers are very remorseful and have apologised to team management for what was poor judgement on their part and accept the punishment handed down
7823222 last year i showed i was not half a second slower than fernando as some people said i would be they could have put me next to michael schumacher and id have showed i am not a no 2 driver even to him
7823223 this year my only focus is winning the world championship
7823224 its like when he says he is not going to do more movies and then always ends up doing them i think i am kind of in a similar situation
7823225 i would like to pass on the metal gear series to younger staff members and then go on to produce the title and not be so attached to it
7823226 from the guy who made the metal gear solid games
7823227 gaz is back now he is the captain of our team
7823228 when he is fit it will be a good battle i played all last season but it is up to the gaffer
7823229 i know gary is the captain and when he plays i have just got to try and play harder
7823230 im sure it will continue that way for the next week or so
7823231 its a very busy time and as i said were looking to bring another two maybe three players
7823232 when youre in the premier league you do get linked with so many players some of its true some of its not
7823233 there are so many players at your disposal that its hard to get the right one and we dont want to just throw money away but at the moment weve started off well so were in no rush
7823234 the hardest thing for us at blackburn is that because weve come into the job late were kind of playing catch up as far as targets are concerned ones which other clubs have had for 12 months or two years
7823235 i just feel sorry for her having to appear here in this role
7823236 its extremely hard to deal with both for her and for me
7823237 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7823238 i ask every single one of you to work as hard for barack obama and joe biden as you did for me
7823239 shell have to if shes thinking about what her future is going to be in american politics
7823240 there are people who dont blame al gore or george bush for what happened in 2000 they blame ralph nader
7823241 the same criticisms that are being levelled at michelle obama that shes too harsh too opinionated thats the same thing that hillary clinton endured
7823242 when bill clinton was running they tried to hide her away too
7823243 shes got to sell herself as well as her husband and i suspect she can do it
7823244 she is a dynamic personality and she should showcase that

7823256 augusts fall in the german ifo business confidence index clearly adds to the recent run of bad news on the eurozones largest economy
7823257 this is the most sickening election they attack me saying i am pro jewish which is an act of desperation
7823258 we fear fraud we are not happy with the ballot list
7823259 its not anwar versus the other candidate its anwar versus the entire government machinery
7823260 most of the core supporters of keadilan are factory workers my concern is the turnout and its too low for comfort
7823261 from our exit poll figures and what we are tracking anwar is safely leading in the polls and i think that it is right to say about 61 percent
7823262 we are still not declaring victory as we will wait for the official election results from the election commission
7823263 we are expecting anwars win to be as big as when wan azizah contested but we think that it will be less in terms of absolute numbers due to it being a working day for many
7823264 i will vote for anwar he represents the voice of the people god willing he will win
7823265 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong stand alone value proposition for shareholders
7823266 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7823267 the only black spot was that copper earnings were down slightly after they had some mining issues during the year
7823268 we will not attend the clear message is that the dialogue is still under way and we dont expect any member of the executive to address us until that dialogue has been concluded
7823269 subdued economic prospects and the expectation of additional price hikes continued to depress consumer sentiment
7823270 the german economy is encountering an increasingly more difficult situation
7823271 are markedly more sceptical with regard to the six month outlook
7823272 as slightly positive and the outlook is assessed less critically
7823273 one thing has become crystal clear the german consumer is no match for the rapid slowdown of the global economy
7823274 consumers are not interpreting the marked decrease in crude oil prices as an all clear signal when it comes to purchasing power
7823275 the turnaround in the index lately is a worrying sign that the economy is slowing fast

7823311 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
7823312 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
7823313 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
7823314 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
7823315 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
7823316 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7823317 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
7823318 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
7823319 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7823320 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7823321 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7823322 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7823323 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7823324 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7823325 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7823326 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7823327 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7823328 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7823329 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7823330 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7823331 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7823332 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
7823333 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
7823334 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
7823335 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
7823336 reinforcing what everyone thinks they know about the place this was brand marketing at its most effective
7823337 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
7823338 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7823339 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7823340 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7823341 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7823342 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7823343 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7823344 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7823345 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7823346 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7823347 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7823348 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7823349 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7823350 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7823351 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7823352 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want

7823354 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7823355 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7823356 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7823357 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7823358 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7823359 you might think if you were attempting to define public service broadcasting for this modern competitive age that your very starting point would be what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of tvs appeal
7823360 with no money to spend they see tv as the primary form of entertainment

7823462 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7823463 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7823464 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7823465 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7823466 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt

7823476 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7823477 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7823478 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7823479 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7823480 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup

7823485 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time

7823487 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7823488 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too

7823578 in this case the use of an esb significantly complicated something that really shouldnt have been all that complicated
7823579 in the soa world theres transaction oriented people the old eai people and now theyre the esb people theyre transaction oriented business process oriented when it comes to data theyre single row reads single row writes the paradigm that those developers use is very much one of process logic
7823580 data folks are used to thinking in terms of data sets they dont write code they draw lines between tables to create joins thats how they think theyre 98 percent read people
7823581 what i think happens in the soa world is that its really dominated initially by those trying to composite together applications these are the eai people whats starting to happen now is that those who are data oriented are having their voices heard thats going to shake things up
7823582 web 2 0 guys view it the problem as just these big sets of data they want to join
7823583 they approach it the issue with a fresh perspective they really arent bogged down by thinking solely in terms of transactions or data sets they arent committed to this idea that they must have an esb theyre just looking for the neatest most efficient way to do it integrate these resources

7823593 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7823594 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7823595 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7823596 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7823597 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7823598 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7823599 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7823600 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7823601 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7823602 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7823603 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7823604 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7823605 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7823606 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7823607 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7823608 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7823609 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7823610 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7823611 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7823612 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7823613 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7823614 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7823615 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7823616 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7823617 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7823618 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7823619 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7823620 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7823621 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7823622 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7823623 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7823624 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7823625 who are open to doing something on the production side
7823626 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7823627 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7823628 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7823629 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7823630 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7823631 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7823632 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7823633 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7823634 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7823635 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7823636 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7823637 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7823638 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7823639 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7823642 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7823643 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7823644 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7823645 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7823646 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7823647 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7823648 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7823649 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7823650 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7823651 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7823652 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

7823656 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7823657 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7823658 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

7823706 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7823707 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

7823710 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7823711 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7823712 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7823713 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7823717 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7823718 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7823722 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7823723 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7823724 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7823725 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

7823729 the way that vertica was designed was to operate natively on this grid kind of computing architecture for us our customers were looking at various deployment options one of the things that was really incredible to us was how seamless it was to operate on the commercial offerings that have become available weve been working on amazon for quite a while and what we found was that the way vertica was fundamentally designed was to run on a cloud so we see very little difference in running on the cloud versus running on premises in an enterprise data center
7823730 although offshoring an it helpdesk may produce significant cost savings it management needs to determine whether that decision is right for the enterprise
7823731 for most it organizations the helpdesk is the primary end user facing organization so if end users are not satisfied with it then it will have a negative effect on the it organization
7823732 when the help desk is outsourced the service provider tries to capture the information into a knowledge database but the information is not always kept up to date or easily understood
7823733 a client employee may have a problem on a pc and want to know how to fix it instead of explaining how to fix the problem the offshore agent may take control of the employees pc and change the image without explaining how this was accomplished because the agent doesnt want to insult the client
7823734 t he client employee may be dissatisfied because he or she doesnt learn what was wrong or how to fix the problem resulting in a need to call the help desk again in the future
7823735 w hen a help desk problem is sent via e mail or on a web chat site this language problem is not a factor and customer satisfaction is positive
7823736 although quality in the first year of offshoring is likely to be poorer than domestic help desk solutions if an enterprise can be patient quality and customer satisfaction can reach acceptable levels that are on par with domestic service
7823737 this occurs more rapidly with global clients that have a multinational presence if a client has perseverance and end users are tolerant then an offshore help desk can be successful

7823739 they went apparently with the intent to conduct a cordon and search because of allegations there may have been weapons in the camp
7823740 the government has been waiting for an opportunity to close the camp down
7823741 if people start to have the feeling that the war has been taken to the camps then youre talking about a tinderbox
7823742 the government wants to evacuate the camp by any means peacefully or by force
7823743 kalma is seen as a stronghold and thats why the government targeted this camp
7823744 im very happy but at the same time sad because there are other mothers sisters and daughters who are still at home waiting for their sons to be released

7823746 there will be no peace without the release of all prisoners
7823747 its an indescribable feeling this happiness i hope that every palestinian prisoner will get to feel it
7823748 im very very happy today but this is just a little step for us palestinians
7823749 i dont think that what my son did was a mistake it was right because it is our right to defend ourselves from our enemy
7823750 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7823751 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7823752 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7823753 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7823784 for the oil year 2007 08 we have already lost one million tons of food demand and about 5 00 000 tons of bio diesel demand as a result of high prices
7823785 incremental supply exceeded incremental demand by almost 1 5 million tonnes and the bulk of this excess has come in the second half of the year
7823786 i believe the strong price rises of the first quarter of 2008 finally began to meet resistance in the second quarter and got reflected in the volume of business transaction during june
7823787 we saw strong evidence of this in the case of sunflower oil and soya oil

7823801 we need to be winning these type of games and we spoke about that beforehand to be fair our attitude was great
7823802 any player would want to play for arsenal of course but for inler this may be perhaps a little early maybe a season too early
7823803 its a game we want to win but its also a way to give some members of the squad time on the pitch
7823804 its too early to be deliberately resting people but i want to keep as many members of the squad as involved as possible
7823805 i have to make sure that everybody retains a high level of match fitness
7823806 we know that yeovil will come here to enjoy the occasion and they will work very hard
7823807 so its not so much about the team we play the key to the game will be attitude and we have to approach the game in the same way we did the games against spurs and liverpool

7823813 the u s is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in north korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7823814 visits to facilities review of documents interviews with technical personnel and other measures unanimously agreed upon among the six parties
7823815 the u s however raised all of a sudden an issue of applying an international standard to the verification of the nuclear declaration abusing this agreed point
7823816 it pressured north korea to accept such inspection as scouring any place as it pleases to collect samples and measure them
7823817 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete phase two of the denuclearization process
7823818 will work closely with relevant countries to have north korea resume the disablement work as early as possible

7823914 they were like lets ground the show a little more it cant be a cartoon we cant have the show be weird and not get an audience
7823915 and we were like we cant have the show be boring and not get the people back we had last year the challenge to me was to make sure the fundamental dna of the show didnt change

7823922 at 1 40am a fire broke out in several tents there were a number of appliances in attendance for safety
7823923 police were called at around 2am yesterday after some toilet blocks were set alight at the festival
7823924 security staff were called and police officers attended where a large number of people had gathered when officers arrived people were dispersed from the area no arrests were made
7823925 im back having come off five internationals so i have some confidence
7823926 we australia didnt do too well and were played off the park some times but we played some great opposition like argentina ivory coast and serbia japan and korea i was very busy
7823927 because its an under 23 competition and we didnt have that many experienced players it was always going to be difficult with the group we had it was always going to be a lot more challenging
7823928 every team we played had great players but it was a great experience playing in front of big crowds
7823929 i had to work hard and was really busy they were the hardest games i have ever played in as i had up to 14 shots on target to deal with
7823930 its great to be back here with the boys and away from the humidity
7823931 experience wise i made the right choice going to beijing i would have liked to have challenged marcus harder from the start but if you look at the games i played in it was worthwhile going
7823932 i am bubbling with confidence and cant wait for tonight any competition that has a road to wembley is a good competition
7823933 it is terrible to hear festival goers were ripped off by touts
7823934 the atmosphere was so cool i only managed to see three bands
7823935 rage against the machine were amazing this was my fourth reading festival and it was brilliant even though the toilets were on fire
7823936 ive been coming to reading for three years in a row now
7823937 i did not see any trouble this year there was a really nice atmosphere at the festival
7823938 but there were some idiots throwing stuff at our tent and yelling stuff at us in the campsite
7823939 it is amazing reading is legendary and for us to be here again is an honour and a privilege
7823940 anybody eating that sausage would be very likely to be ill
7823941 flies could be landing one minute on some dog poo and next minute on the food transferring bacteria
7823942 it was very bland but you expect that for the price you pay it didnt seem particularly bad just ordinary
7823943 we went in for a meal in the afternoon and that night i was sick it continued right through the next day and more the day after until there was nothing left to be sick the sweat was absolutely pouring off me
7823944 everybodys entitled to safe food and the law says that the food should be safe when sold and clearly this isnt safe
7823945 this is a fairly straightforward operation theyre not cooking from scratch they are just virtually reheating food thats already been cooked and so they shouldnt have got it wrong
7823946 we have seen a slight reduction in crime at this years festival which is very pleasing
7823947 obviously people may still report offences to us that have happened at the festival but at this stage we are happy with the reduction the figures show
7823948 the policing operation has gone very well and i have to say that there was a fantastic atmosphere at the festival
7823949 it is a mixture of everything drugs offensive weapons and ticket touting
7823950 over two days we arrested well over 100 people but the weapons we found were minor and we appreciate some people had camping equipment
7823951 this is clearly something people want and would be great exercise and good for them
7823952 we were not great to be honest in the first half hour we did pretty well
7823953 our attacking and defensive organisation looked good but then we started making mistakes
7823954 i think it had a lot to do with changing players all the time as we had rolling replacements but it was certainly an incredibly fast game we didnt play that fast at all last season so there was a lot to learn and a lot to take from it
7823955 i was very pleased we nullified them at the break down and defensively we were very very strong

7823990 by tearing up his check for obama he basically wrote one to mccain
7823991 i openly no flamingly endorse obama whether he says hes for gay marriage or not i know under obama it will only be a matter of time until the country sees the legalization of gay marriage
7823992 for our gay lesbian bisxexual transgender rights to continue to grow and not further diminish then we need to stand behind obama good luck with your life mr colichman

7824005 i dont suppose it may have occurred to you that the cecal valve feature may have been already encoded in the genetic information of the lizard and was selected due to a changed diet or manifested through interbreeding with the indigenous population or maybe nobody ever noticed it before like the aforementioned rat
7824006 changes in appearance dont prove the generation of new genetic information you can change the diet of birds to tougher seeds and the shape of their bills will change you can drink a lot of beer and the shape of your gut will change these lizards changed their diet
7824007 their gut got bigger due to a changed diet and thus we are told that

7824019 i dont suppose it may have occurred to you that the cecal valve feature may have been already encoded in the genetic information of the lizard and was selected due to a changed diet or manifested through interbreeding with the indigenous population or maybe nobody ever noticed it before like the aforementioned rat

7824038 we call on the government to guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7824039 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels
7824040 we have had 30 years of sex education in secondary schools and it has never been more easy for teenagers to get hold of contraception without their parents knowing yet both abortion rates and sexually transmitted infection rates have continued to rise

7824092 die frage ist nicht wer man meisten von einer ma nahme profitiert sondern wem sie am meisten hilft
7824093 die steuersenkung hilft eindeutig den menschen am meisten die schon jetzt ein f nftel ihres einkommens f r das essen ausgeben m ssen das sind die menschen die am wenigsten verdienen sie brauchen diese entlastung am dringendsten
7824094 das ist eine sp rbare entlastung das kann man nicht vom tisch wischen indem polemisiert wird dass jemand der sich teurere lebensmittel leisten kann vielleicht um 30 euro mehr spart es sind die menschen mit niedrigen einkommen die ma nahmen gegen die inflation am st rksten sp ren die denen die inflation am st rksten zugesetzt hat
7824095 wenn sogar ein bernhard felderer eine ak forderung unterst tzt muss was dran sein ihm kann man ja wirklich keine n he zur interessensvertretung der arbeitnehmerinnen nachsagen
7824096 es muss um die menschen gehen und nicht darum wer eine solche ma nahme letztendlich umsetzt oder damit politisch punktet polemiken gegen diese entlastung schaden der sache und verunsichern die menschen die in den vergangenen monaten am st rksten unter der inflation gelitten haben
7824097 weil eine steuerliche entlastung durch eine steuerreform aktuell nicht absehbar ist
7824098 wer sie umsetzt ist uns egal hauptsache es geschieht schnell

7824103 die unter ministerin bures endlich umgesetzte dienstrechtliche gleichstellung die regelung f r nebenberuflich lehrende oder die einf hrung der studentischen mitbestimmung waren deutliche zeichen daf r dass die fhs der sp ein sehr gro es anliegen sind

7824107 zweitmeinung zu finanzgesch ften ja aber bitte nicht von sobotka
7824108 eine zweitmeinung zum thema finanzen kann nie schaden wenn sie von einem experten kommt wenn sich lr sobotka zu diesem thema u ert ist vorsicht geboten
7824109 wie wunderbar das funktioniert wenn man gr ere summen einsetzt das sieht man ja an der veranlagung der n wohnbaugelder sobotka ist es auf diese weise immerhin gelungen einen verlust von 160 millionen euro an steuergeldern zu erwirtschaften
7824110 gefragt sind nicht belehrungen wof r eine gemeinde finanzielle hilfe braucht sondern klare antworten wieso macht die unterst tzung f r sp gemeinden viel weniger aus als jene f r vp gemeinden wo bleibt die handschlagsqualit t der vpn wenn viele sp gemeinden vergeblich auf bereits versprochene bedarfszuweisungen warten

7824113 ein verteidigungsminister hat nicht auf sp wahlversprechen zu schielen sondern die erf llung seiner milit rischen aufgaben vor augen zu haben
7824114 man stelle sich vor darabos hat die reduktion auf 15 gro teils gebrauchte alte flieger im alleingang ausverhandelt ohne das finanzministerium oder die zust ndigen dienststellen im eigenen ministerium zu informieren oder einzubinden und f r diese neue st ckzahl ein taktisches einsatzkonzept vorbereitet zu haben damit hat der verteidigungsminister nicht nur die sicherheit sterreichs sondern auch jene der ihm anvertrauten piloten gef hrdet
7824115 sogar der chef des generalstabes weigerte sich daraufhin die erforderlichen ver nderungen einzuleiten
7824116 darabos soll dem bundesheer eine weitere amtszeit ersparen denn er hat f r die milit rische sicherheit eindeutig nichts ber

7824120 gemessen am fiktiven finanzierungsbeitrag sterreichs konnten 117 durch erfolgreiche projekte wie der helena studie die dazu einen internationalen vergleich beinhaltet und umfassende wissenschaftliche erkenntnisse liefert wieder zur ckgeholt werden die ersten ergebnisse dieser studie f hren dramatisch vor augen wie gro der handlungsbedarf im hinblick auf die vielen bergewichtigen kinder und jugendlichen ist
7824121 wir haben eine intensive kultur der evaluierung jetzt braucht es eine kultur der konsequenzen wir m ssen mit den ergebnissen aus studien konkret arbeiten und in umsetzung gehen
7824122 wir brauchen ein pr ventionsgesetz um dinge festlegen zu k nnen auch der schulbereich ist hier gefordert rahmenbedingungen zu schaffen
7824123 jedes vierte kind ist dick die helena studie liefert die wissenschaftlichen beweise daf r jeder wei das adipositas sch dlich ist alle reden davon doch kaum einer tut etwas dagegen auch wien schweigt die helena studie belegt deutlich wie negativ sich dieses passive freizeitverhalten bei kindern und jugendlichen auf die gesundheit und der folge auf das sp tere leben auswirkt

7824128 die zeit dr ngt die sorgen und n te der pensionisten d rfen nicht auf die lange bank geschoben werden
7824129 davon sind fast 100 000 neupensionisten betroffen es ist angesichts dieser teuerung nicht zumutbar dass jemand der heuer im februar in pension gegangen ist erst im j nner 2010 also 23 monate sp ter eine teuerungsabgeltung bekommt

7824133 there is a price illusion on the part of the board of directors looking to sell a bank and a risk aversion by the buyers
7824134 that seems to be a low cost low risk option

7824136 our terminal was built in the early 50s for a vessel that on its inaugural run in 1956 carried 32 vehicles and 122 passengers
7824137 at yarmouths peak period the cat and scotia prince had the capacity to move 700 vehicles and 2500 passengers through the yarmouth terminal the terminal as it is at present is not adequate to meet the heightened security requirements the needs of canada border services nor the desires of todays travelers
7824138 i think what might be intriguing to people is the approach we took

7824151 24 september noch vor der wahl ber die gesetzesinitiativen abgestimmt werden kann
7824152 f nf sachpunkte die den negativen auswirkungen der teuerung entgegenwirken
7824153 das ist ein ganz normaler demokratischer vorgang samt einbeziehung des parlaments und das ist ein positiver vorgang denn die politik hat gemeinsam mit einem parlament auf augenh he die aufgabe den negativen auswirkungen der teuerung entgegenzuwirken
7824154 dass es selbstverst ndlich einen ersatz f r den entfall der einnahmen aus den studiengeb hren geben soll das war von der sp immer vorgesehen

7824170 the board of directors of pininfarina embraces these values so that pininfarina may always follow your high example without reservations and to ensure that these values continue to be the principles guiding the company as it pursues growth and success along the path that your have so clearly defined
7824171 i would like to thank everyone employees customers partners public institutions and the public at large for their great expression of solidarity and mourning through which they demonstrated the widespread and deep respect that my brother andrea enjoyed both as a man and as an entrepreneur with a high sense of personal and institutional commitment to fostering the growth and development of the pininfarina group and italian industry in general
7824172 as a strong sign of a continuity that dates back 75 years our family has assumed full direct responsibility
7824173 together with the board we provided an immediate response to the tragic emergency of the passing of my brother andrea by placing our confidence in the people who worked with my brother in developing an industrial and financial plan that has received the support of qualified industrial partners and financial institutions
7824174 together with the board i am committed to ensuring that the development plan defined by my brother is implemented with the expected timing and modalities with the goal of strengthening every component of our company

7824182 listening to them was like undergoing a slow frontal lobotomy
7824183 the women who were hostile to me made me mad
7824184 and that made me want to be hostile to them i cant imagine men in the same position not reacting the same way
7824185 there was something so warm and bonded in this handshake it was more affectionate than any handshake id ever received from a strange woman to me woman to woman introductions often seem fake and cold full of limp gentility

7824236 i had asked for some clarifications from the indian premier league on the doping case of asif and would be travelling to india next week to attend a tribunal hearing
7824237 the difference in traces of banned substance found in asifs sample was not surprising and he would get a fair hearing from the tribunal

7824248 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

7824255 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7824256 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7824257 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7824258 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7824259 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical

7824289 i will not focus on the exact figures warships totaling a maximum of 45 000 tons can pass through and this is for non black sea littoral countries there is no such limitation for black sea littoral countries thats to say we have the right to have as many ships there as we want to so does russia but non littorals do not have such a right a country cannot send a ship sized more than 30 000 tons to the black sea but it can send ships of 45 000 tons in total
7824290 you know that they the us wanted to sail a 69 000 ton hospital ship and we gave the order to our foreign ministry saying its passage was possible by no means because the montreux convention doesnt allow this and they the us took this as reasonable and didnt insist we want everyone to be loyal to agreements whatever those agreements may be

7824335 when the user mouses over a book a contextual popup comes up containing information about the book and a set of associated actions part of the popup is a button menu sort of like a button and combo box widget that allows the user to provide information about what he or she did with the book the first thing to note is that combination of a button in a menu is not standard yet it makes sense because it saves a click for the most important action secondly the menu is effectively a popup within a popup which is a big no no in the classic world but works well in this context the elements of the menu are not buttons but check boxes which allow multiple selection another violation of classic user interface elements but which works very well in this context what is remarkable is how intuitive this gadget is you are interacting with it in the context of a book and each choice is simple and clear such clarity and simplicity was never present in the old interfaces clearly this new approach to uis is great and early adopters are loving it but will it cross over to the mainstream

7824343 of the moon on the moon and from the moon
7824344 i think the way to sell it is that were going to the moon as a step beyond
7824345 the other is that the moon is an interesting enough place to stay as well people talk about exit strategies on the moon to touch base leave and go to mars i think thats dumb
7824346 theres still a lot of science to be done on the moon its a natural world with natural complexity
7824347 were never going to have a long term 50 year plus research base on mars if we cant figure out how to do that on the moon so lets figure out how to do it on the moon

7824418 maybe we should have had a discussion before policy is sic put out there publicly mr adams said
7824419 a lot of points and concern about the policy during the meeting
7824420 the basis is right its how you get there and there are some people who have great difficultly in organising a 12 year old to get to school when they dont want to go to school he said
7824421 a lot of us are uncomfortable about this policy but it was a rudd labor commitment and kevin rudd confirmed that yesterday that its a promise he will be keeping she told abc radio today
7824422 i think its fair to say there is a great deal of concern within the caucus
7824423 its a pretty extreme organisation thats got extreme powers that doesnt confront anybody else in australian society he said
7824424 i dont think we need to keep this at the extreme end of where it is at the moment i think we should be able to wind that back somewhat before 2010
7824425 a federal government committed to workplace rights has no justification for keeping the abcc until 2010 greens senator rachel siewert said
7824426 the greens will not shrink from defending the basic human rights of workers including those in the building and construction industry
7824427 its a little discouraging but i suppose its something wehave to expect in a way because we will be constantly shockedwith credit worries
7824428 the banks have pretty well lost so much capacity to financeeconomic growth the whole question about progressing is alittle up in the air at the same time the central banks cantdo much about it because inflation has accelerated from targets the market is caught in a trap
7824429 catholic public leaders inconvenienced by the abortion debate tend to take a hard line in talking about the separation of church and state
7824430 speaker of the house nancy pelosi is a gifted public servant of strong convictions and many professional skills regrettably knowledge of catholic history and teaching does not seem to be one of them
7824431 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7824432 since speaker pelosi has in her words studied the issue for a long time she must know very well one of the premier works on the subject jesuit john connerys abortion the development of the roman catholic perspective
7824433 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude
7824434 or to put it in the blunter words of the great lutheran pastor dietrich bonhoeffer
7824435 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life
7824436 ardent practicing catholics will quickly learn from the historical record that from apostolic times the christian tradition overwhelmingly held that abortion was grievously evil
7824437 of course we now know with biological certainty exactly when human life begins thus todays religious alibis for abortion and a so called right to choose are nothing more than that alibis that break radically with historic christian and catholic belief
7824438 the duty of the church and other religious communities is moral witness the duty of the state and its officials is to serve the common good which is always rooted in moral truth a proper understanding of the separation of church and state does not imply a separation of faith from political life but of course its always important to know what our faith actually teaches

7824452 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

7824472 we cant allow this im going to veto that treaty lets blowem out of the sky
7824473 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7824474 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7824475 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7824476 as of right now it seems like everythings moving forward

7824478 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7824479 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7824480 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7824481 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7824482 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7824483 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7824484 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7824485 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7824486 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7824487 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7824488 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7824489 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7824490 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7824491 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7824492 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7824493 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7824494 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7824495 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7824496 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7824497 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7824498 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7824499 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7824500 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7824501 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7824502 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7824503 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7824504 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7824505 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7824506 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7824507 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

7824511 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7824512 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7824513 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7824514 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7824515 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7824516 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7824517 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7824518 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7824519 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7824520 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7824521 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7824522 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

7824560 a large proportion of the large vessel segment of the fleet is experiencing significant rust out
7824561 consequently vessels that deliver ccg core programs and provide support to other government departments are deteriorating at a rapid rate
7824562 as a result these vessels are increasingly less reliable experience frequent breakdowns resulting in los t program time and are more costly to operate and maintain which contributes to overall ccg funding pressures
7824563 the coast guard has an aging fleet that is costly to maintain and operate
7824564 progress in renewing the coast guards fleet has been slow the current replacement schedule is already becoming outdated and unrealistic it provides for replacing many vessels long after they have passed their estimated useful lives

7824646 i work for a publicly traded biotech company that happens to write software that is in fact kind of critical for the business without it no data would ever be read from our instruments and no analyses would be performed on that data the problem is that as a biotech company we are not taking software quality seriously we have no senior management with any history of commercial software development our c level has really no clue whatsoever what software really is much less what is going on in software development all of our quality processes are related to manufacturing our system not software so we are constantly forced into ad hoc development since there is no real process for our development repeated requests to hire someone with some real commercial software development experience have gone unanswered i have been to the ceo directly one on one and although he agreed this was an issue thanked me and said he would look into it that was the end of it he has bigger things to worry about so the question is this just a fact of life and i need to deal the best i can what else can i do to get some attention on software quality in the company

7824696 i have an idea for an article that id like to do but i need your input id like to do an article on aussie opinions about america i got the idea after reading your article about how good your commenters are and i agree the problem is i cant write the article without first having the opinions but if i could get a half dozen comments on the subject from your regular commenters i think it could make for a terrific article most americans i think have a high regard for aussies based on our mutual support of one another in our common wars these positive views were i believe re enforced with the rather sudden appearance of a whole bunch of first rate aussie movies in the 70s among some of my favorites would be gallipoli and breaker morant then of course everybody loved mel gibson and crocodile dundee but americans really dont know what aussies think about them and i think they might be surprised i for one was very much surprised by the amount of support for america coming from down under especially considering that our own leftist media has us all thinking that everyone in the world hates our guts

7824802 last year you had no idea what to expect it was new schemes for us the players we didnt know how they were going to react weve got some players that are back that we know pretty much how theyre going to prepare how theyre going to handle a packed house crowd
7824803 so i think that there is a little less from that standpoint but there are also higher expectations we expect these players to play at a higher level and to perform and to execute at a better level
7824804 we talked to our football team about that how well you play to a high percentage is more about you its how you prepare its how you play on saturday you dont have any control over the opponent i cant tell you whether theyve had good practices or good practices i cant tell you whether theyre prepared to play all we can do is control our own fate
7824805 if well show up and play and we talk all the time with our football players is that when the game is over regardless of the outcome if theres no regrets then we will have played as well as we possibly can we want to play leave everything on the field and whatever happens the next week well pick up the pieces and well go on and move to the next game its kind of 12 one game seasons

7824840 unfortunately once again we have suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7824841 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7824842 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7824843 now we must continue to push to the maximum to develop the car and improve reliability in order to be as well prepared as possible for the forthcoming races
7824844 we still have two test sessions at monza and then jerez and a lot of hard days work in the factory
7824845 unfortunately yet again we were not reliable both from a technical point of view and in how we operated on the track given what happened during raikkonens pit stop and then the failure of his engine
7824846 we have a great potential from both the team and the car capable of putting us in front of everyone else but if not all elements are operating at their optimum then we are throwing away precious points that could cost us dear
7824847 we must work to remedy these problems and thats what we will do starting in the days that follow
7824848 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everybody will sign up
7824849 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july
7824850 it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
7824851 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
7824852 the driver of house prices in the near term will be the resilience of the economy and the outlook for the labour market both of which appear to be showing cracks

7824866 all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of ear ache

7824886 because of a renewed interest in nuclear power in this country and the world this grant will be used for funding graduate students who will become the next generation nuclear workforce specifically in radioactive waste disposal radiochemistry and the environmental aspects of nuclear power generation

7824888 the nuclear education and curriculum development grant that we received last year was used to update much needed radiation detection and measurement equipment for the teaching laboratories
7824889 this year well be developing a new course as well as expanding another course with advanced portable radiation spectroscopy systems that will be purchased with the grant grants like these keep our students at the cutting edge of technology but with a fundamental understanding of the underlying principles

7824911 ive known hemaji as a wonderful person and if she says sherlyn is promoting nudity in her name i dare not contest her opinion after all the video did receive 19 cuts from the censor board if sherlyn has a diva like image she cant help it you cant ask a madonna to be like an alka yagnik can you
7824912 see sherlyn made this video as a tribute to hemajis dard hemajis dus numbri released in1976 so her dard is of that era sherlyns dard is of todays times which is felt by everyone whos young we all know that this dard is a bit emotional and a bit sexual too

7825047 even of what religion or creed they are as we firmly stand to defend the rights of individuals it is against our islamic faith and we condemn the attack of this milf group against the innocent civilian people
7825048 what has been claimed by the milf is already embodied in the september 2 1996 peace agreeement in which all the provisions which was finally signed by the former president fidel v ramos has finally been signed in accordance with meticulous process
7825049 it is noted also that the bje will be among the issues discussed by the joint working group which had commenced their scheduled exploratory talks last august 20 in manila and among the vital concern is the reviewing of the signed final 1996 peace agreement which as claimed by the mnlf was left by the government unattended in which some the phase 1 provisions of the accord were left unimplemented and the second phase of the agreement have not been given serious time by president arroyo to settle with the mnlf for its implementation so the problem is that president arroyo has jumped into another agreement which is uncertain and unclear which created more serious problem in mindanao
7825050 the joint working group would have to discuss and settle first the problem of the bje on the ancestral domain claim of the milf which is an absolute duplication of the finally signed peace agreement and the peace negotiators involved in the bje should have first consulted the mnlf leadership if the moa signing would not affect the grp mnlf agreement should the government finally sign the moa with the milf

7825176 what happened to angel lafita was unfortunate but it has opened an opportunity for me
7825177 im now excited about the prospect of working towards winning a starting berth
7825178 were all aware that the competition is stronger this year and nobody wants to be left in the cold
7825179 we all have quality its a very strong squad so we cant speak of just eleven
7825180 the stakes are so high in these two games not as much for the liga because its just starting and a lot more work remains but because of the opponent
7825181 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7825182 i know that i have the quality to play there and i just need time in the team to prove that
7825183 i have already told him that there is a lot of competition for places and that he needs to be at his best
7825184 this is the philosophy i want my players to understand im not more important than chelsea chelsea is more important than any of us
7825185 im sure frank lampard will score a minimum of 15 goals this season because he tries all the time
7825186 he trains every day to do this deco can also score 15 goals or maybe 20
7825187 if lampard or deco score the goals for us thats good but its not important whats important is chelsea win
7825188 we made some errors and didnt play very well because essien had not trained for 15 days
7825189 ballack had an injury but played lampard also had an injury but played its fantastic for chelsea and the fans that we were still able to win
7825190 i know we didnt play well at wigan but at this moment its the best of what i have
7825191 im just happy to have finished that game and now i have another week to work with the players hopefully the doctor will put more players in my hands and against
7825192 i hope that well be the winter champions that remains out goal
7825193 we have absolute patience we are convinced that we have the right man in j rgen and that we are on the right road
7825194 i dont know any team that could replace players of their quality we cannot do it either
7825195 i am optimistic that we will now start to get our stability back with the return of demichelis and toni
7825196 i n the civil suit filed friday blitzer accuses ross of stealing 195 000 from him the suit reportedly details rosss estranged relationship with his daughter allison blitzer
7825197 i think weve seen in the last few seasons we can beat anybody you have to be positive you have to believe that you can do it again make it to the final
7825198 ive played a few finals now and you can see that anything can happen you can play well you can play not well you can win and lose you have to make it there i think we have the quality and experience to do it and we are looking forward to it
7825199 its the final that i think about less i dont know why because it was the one that we played better and the one we showed more desire we were devastated after that final but after that game we realised arsenal was a big club and we could compete

7825265 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7825266 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7825267 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7825268 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7825269 a fast time intelligence led operation in oval managed to stop a large group we believed were headed for the carnival to commit such scenes of disorder
7825270 no one wants to see this unique event being overshadowed by such unacceptable behaviour
7825271 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7825272 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7825273 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7825274 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets
7825275 ive been very impressed its been lively and colourful and people are really enjoying themselves
7825276 the number of arrests is up on last year but that is predominantly because of proactive policing
7825277 the message is that there is no place for knives at the carnival
7825278 we share the concern of londoners over the recent spate of knife crime and we are doing all we can to combat that
7825279 online journals promise to serve more information to more dispersed audiences and are more efficiently searched and recalled but because they are used differently than print scientists and scholars tend to search electronically and follow hyperlinks rather than browse or peruse electronically available journals may portend an ironic change for science using a database of 34 million articles their citations 1945 to 2005 and online availability 1998 to 2005 i show that as more journal issues came online the articles referenced tended to be more recent fewer journals and articles were cited and more of those citations were to fewer journals and articles the forced browsing of print archives may have stretched scientists and scholars to anchor findings deeply into past and present scholarship searching online is more efficient and following hyperlinks quickly puts researchers in touch with prevailing opinion but this may accelerate consensus and narrow the range of findings and ideas built upon

7825312 northern ireland has been home to minority ethnic communities for centuries irish travellers are an indigenous minority ethnic group there has been a jewish community here for well over a century the first members of the indian community arrived here in the 1920s and 1930s there have been significant numbers of chinese people here since the 1960s
7825313 the northern ireland census of 2001 estimates that a total of 26 659 people living in northern ireland were born outside the united kingdom while the minority ethnic population of northern ireland is estimated at 14 279 out of a total population of 1 68 million some key ngos believe that these figures are significant under estimation of the ethic diversity in northern ireland and the non indigenous population is closer to 45 000 people based on the lowest estimate ethnic diversity accounts for about 1 of the northern ireland population based on higher estimates this figure could as high as 2 5 of the population recent trends would indicate that ethnic diversity will continue to gradually increase in northern ireland more recently increasing numbers of people from the eu accession states have moved to britain and northern ireland to take up employment 80 there are also a small number of refugees and asylum seekers in northern ireland it is estimated in june 2005 there were 141 asylum seekers in northern ireland although one ngo has estimated that there may be as many as 2000 refugees in northern ireland
7825314 the speed and extent of the increase in the numbers of migrant workers in northern ireland and the sheer diversity of people involved pose complex challenges for government and society alike
7825315 the recent trends in inward migration to northern ireland appear to be driven by a number of factors including the lack of skilled labour in certain key areas of the public and private sectors companies in northern ireland are increasingly active in seeking to source labour from outside northern ireland the pull factor from existing migrants in ireland who are encouraging and assisting friends and relations to access employment in northern ireland the push factors from sending countries where migrant labour is sourced including the new eu member states
7825316 an asylum seeker is a person from overseas who has come to the united kingdom and claims asylum from persecution in their home country while the claim is being assessed the person is considered as an asylum seeker once the home office has made a decision on the claim the person is either granted permission to stay becoming known as a refugee or is refused permission to remain in the united kingdom

7825344 i look for what they like to do on first second and third down ill just put the tape in and look at all first down passes first and second down runs third down nickel stuff
7825345 everything has to be done for the players by tuesday night
7825346 they all get a book of the game plan it shows the opponents pass plays and runs its a pretty good sized book and it takes a little time to put that together meantime the offensive coaches are off doing their own thing
7825347 we could go until about 11 oclock its like getting ready for a final exam every week you want to have as much knowledge as you can so we try to get everything fed to the players on wednesday
7825348 it all depends what works for you like just talking on the phone with your loved ones or like just paying bills thatll get your mind off it
7825349 i dont have a lot of physical demands in this game but the mental part wears on you

7825353 i think its easier said than done especially if youve had a bad game or you lost
7825354 when that happens you find yourself sitting around thinking about the plays you could have made thats why its important that by this point youve learned to have a short memory
7825355 its a chance to get your heart and your head at 100 percent

7825359 i go from the small to the large the part to the whole
7825360 the individual meeting with the coordinators maybe two or three guys then to the whole group the offense defense special teams then everybody together you feel like youre going from one meeting to another at times but thats good it keeps people organized and on the same page

7825373 theres something very wrong with the culture in our state hospitals
7825374 i think we have to beef up our hospital administration at the state or the institutional level or maybe both
7825375 maybe bring professional hospital administrators in we tend to promote from within the system
7825376 what that did was it removed that urgency that we felt that we absolutely felt we had to get this hearing done if he was going to get moved
7825377 if he got moved he was going to lose his treatment opportunities

7825381 we played very well on saturday but in the end the same thing happened and we lost again
7825382 we showed that we can cope with this level but we are really disappointed that we didnt get points we need to be more focused and concentrated on the next game and try to get points
7825383 we can see now that we have quality in our team but the main thing is to concentrate for 90 minutes because the premier league is a different level and the opposition team will punish you if you make mistakes
7825384 we made two mistakes and they scored two goals against us so we need to be more concentrated in defence we need to threaten the opposition goal a little bit more
7825385 hopefully in the future we will create more chances and score more goals
7825386 we have shown we can compete at this level and we have some quality but we need to be more concentrated because the opposition will punish you for any mistake you make
7825387 we have faced two good teams in the first two weeks but bolton are a good team too and we need to be focused on every game
7825388 you ask anyone here and they will tell you im quite stubborn
7825389 i want to do well and i want to do it here and when im passionate about something i try to see it out
7825390 there are one or two things i didnt work on in my own regime last season which i should have done which i have put right this season and i think theres been a massive difference
7825391 it would have been easy to get my name out there and perhaps feel i was going to move but to be honest i hardly even spoke to my agent if you do well at a club like this it can only be good wherever i have been i just love playing football
7825392 hes such a nice bloke and we all wish him well in his recovery but this is a big game because it would be nice to have a run in the cup
7825393 the church is not a theological classroom it is a conversion confession repentance reconciliation forgiveness and sanctification center where flawed people place their trust in christ gather to know and love him better and learn to love others as he has designed the church is messy and inefficient but it is gods wonderful mess the place where he radically transforms hearts and lives

7825403 the club is being run on sound football and business principles in order to develop a squad which can deliver success this season no player would be bought or sold unless that helped to achieve that aim
7825404 we are not interested in selling players who are committed to the club and essential to our first team squad
7825405 if a player refuses to sign a new contract or is not crucial to the managers plans then we will look at offers on a case by case basis it is the only sensible way to build for the future
7825406 we have invested in players this summer identified by the manager who add to the quality of the squad and we will continue to do so as and when appropriate

7825411 i am delighted that older people in the area around banff have been chosen to benefit from this new scheme i know that many older people feel there is a stigma to claiming benefits or are unsure as to how to fill in the forms they need to but this new support will help to change that
7825412 given how much fuel food and other bills have risen recently it is vital that our most vulnerable citizens do not miss out on money to which they are entitled

7825424 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7825425 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7825426 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7825427 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7825428 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon

7825485 had been wise enough not to compromise the territorial integrity of the country
7825486 it is disheartening that in the pursuit of an inordinate ambition by a man who wanted to rewrite the constitution and redefine the geographical size of the country for the sake of currying cheap international support for tenure elongation a vital part of the country was traded away
7825487 most of us grew up to know bakassi as part of nigeria and even the people of the area have stressed this the people should be granted the right to self determination to choose where to belong instead of being forced out of their land just because they have refused to be traded away to cameroon

7825588 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was neither planned nor instructed by the company to be disposed

7825592 with wikitalk you can take talk radio and instantly push it online and create a great dynamic for listeners particularly when you get discussions fueled by hot topics and producers fanning the flames by simultaneously posting updated news videos and pictures we found that stories with multiple layers attracted the most posts
7825593 we would post topics prior to the game get feedback and questions from wikitalk users throughout the game and post the answers we got from the players and managers as well
7825594 the wikitalk split screen functionality is the perfect conduit for extending high energy discussions that start on the radio and spill onto the web not only does wikitalk engage listeners but it instantly marries a radio stations brand with its online assets
7825595 it is the future of talk radio all talk radio stations should incorporate a social site like wikitalk into their programming our listeners loved it

7825603 cases like victor stanley okeefe and equity analytics demonstrate that while keyword searches are useful for coping with the dramatic rise in the volume of esi there are limitations with todays keyword search technologies
7825604 these shortcomings are addressed by clearwells transparent search which provides attorneys and litigation support professionals with the ability to test the efficacy of their keyword lists and refine their word selection in preparation for 26 f conferences this added level of insight dramatically reduces processing and review cost while bolstering defensibility to the new levels now being mandated by current case law
7825605 recent case law is driving a sea change in e discovery search and forcing enterprises and law firms to show their work in the courtroom
7825606 transparent search is the first technology that caters to the unique requirements of lawyers and litigation support professionals by enabling testing sampling and iterative refinement of keyword searches as a result legal teams can now devise more defensible search strategies better collaborate on keyword search terms and dramatically reduce false positives and irrelevant documents prior to review

7825631 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7825632 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7825633 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7825634 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7825635 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7825636 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7825637 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7825638 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7825701 when youre dating a european woman the slovenly way of dressing will not do but the reality is ive also grown up a lot in the last five years and not getting dressed up is partly teenage rebellion i obviously held on to that for too long but i dont want to get into wearing the uniform of the thirty year old actor either the beanie guy the scarf guy it defeats the purpose of individual expression if i ever have a fashion relapse diane lets me know
7825702 my first cannes experience was my first true fashion moment the tradition is that the director escorts his leading lady up the stairs which left me dateless so my date for the evening became karl lagerfeld theres little canadian me sitting next to karl lagerfeld for four and a half hours it was pretty comical
7825703 my education in the world of high fashion started with diane its not something that particularly interested me before that said i dont think ill ever rabidly follow trends the big thing for me is finding clothes that i can wear rather than clothes that wear me
7825704 my mother raised two children entirely by herself which was spectacular of her i didnt grow up in a house that catered to fashion it was more about function
7825705 frankly fringe is more to my taste than something like dawsons creek i didnt grow up watching 90210 i grew up watching the x files
7825706 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7825707 what is the point the dishes will get dirty again
7825708 it can increase the sickness and morbidity of the patient
7825709 patients should insist that doctors and nurses in the hospitals who are attending to them wash their hands before they examine the patients

7825719 certainly we dont want any repeat of what happened last season but the bigger picture was that we went on to win the league so in terms of the season as a whole the defeat at dungannon didnt damage us
7825720 it is a game that is still fresh in my mind i still cant figure out what went wrong we just werent at it on the day and dungannon deserved their win
7825721 the town which was sluggish and uninteresting enough was something like the back of an english watering place out of season
7825722 when you first see it its almost like oz rising out of the lake
7825723 i have no business being that high up in the air going that fast
7825724 it doesnt go too fast and doesnt get off the ground
7825725 the paddle boats are pretty slow too i like them as well
7825726 they just want to be really thrilled so they want speed changes in direction and what we call air time which is that floating sensation that you get just a good out of control type of ride
7825727 whats high in the middle and round at both ends
7825728 its just a piece of americana and to give them credit they really try and keep on that that old time old fashioned sort of feeling
7825729 wooden rollercoasters are never going to go away because theyve got their own feel and their own cachet
7825730 people look at a wooden rollercoaster and just looking at them gives people that extra kind of edge because they go that rickety thing thats never gonna hold up though wooden rollercoasters are usually over built so that they do not fall down

7825741 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7825742 the forced production of cotton and rice originally not indigenous to hungary
7825743 i think native people have come to the realization that the political process is our only chance for trying to change things
7825744 this party has shortcomings but it can take us where we want to go
7825745 we are less than 1 of the countrys population and yet we can elect u s senators and congressmen
7825746 i know its not right for every circumstance for taser guns to be used but that night it happened and then those people are giving out in newspapers that it shouldnt have happened not one of them has a clue not one of them has come near the door to ask what happened what didnt happen

7825767 we got a little comfortable with running up big margins in the urban areas and competing in the suburbs and doing extremely well there and we forgot that about 40 percent of the state is considered rural missouri
7825768 what mccaskill learned from her gubernatorial race was that you have to be authentic and you have to be out there and that cant always be achieved by 30 second tv ads
7825769 the decision to emphasize rural missouri more was a decision that i made at the moment i decided to run
7825770 it would have been political malpractice not to notice that we needed to do better in rural missouri
7825771 if customers really were clamoring for conspicuous calorie counts restaurants would provide them voluntarily
7825772 reality based community know are actually responding to rent seekers or other factions or perhaps driven simply by their own hubris decide that the ski industry is not family friendly enough

7825784 we know that there is much to improve on and bigger challenges just around the corner but we can certainly take some confidence from this start and the speed at which this newly assembled squad have gelled together
7825785 the severity of the was a shock to everyone worldwide and both a1gp and a1 team china will take this opportunity to show support for the local people who have suffered so badly
7825786 im sure the fans in chengdu will be able to show they are getting on with their lives and will give a1gp a warm welcome
7825787 this break is absolutely essential for all the people who travel they dont get the right amount of time with their families and this gives them an opportunity to have at least one week where they are not at the office or workshop
7825788 its a key ingredient of keeping people motivated and happy when you are addressing the calendar which makes next years difficult for them we will have to accommodate that by rotating people they will not be expected to go right through the season

7825802 my life hasnt changed much i just live a very quiet normal life like i always have
7825803 really the only change in my life is whether im working or not and whether i can afford to eat or not and this is one of the good moments where i can afford to eat for the next few months
7825804 the biggest thing was shooting you shoot so quick in television and im really unaccustomed to shooting that quickly and hadnt done really a standard american accent in the way that im doing in this so there were a lot of challenges along the way but the motorcycle riding was the most pleasurable of them all

7825817 we have worked closely with the metropolitan police to ensure that today will be enjoyed safely and by everyone
7825818 lets hope that people leave their knives at home and enjoy the carnival
7825819 the celebrations taking place today are testament to londons welcoming spirit and suitability as the next olympic host
7825820 whilst thousands of people came to join in with the fun and spectacle of carnival once again the event ended with a small minority of people determined to fight and cause trouble
7825821 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7825822 officers had to work hard and deliver a strong interventionist style of policing late into the night to make sure that these criminals were not allowed to take over the streets of notting hill this is not the way anyone can want to see the carnival finish
7825823 through our stop and search use of screening wands and seizures of dangerous dogs we sent a clear message that carnival is no place for such behaviour as this
7825824 a fast time intelligence led operation in oval managed to stop a large group we believed were headed for the carnival to commit such scenes of disorder
7825825 no one wants to see this unique event being overshadowed by such unacceptable behaviour
7825826 as a former resident of ladbroke grove i have watched the notting hill carnival go from strength to strength each year to become an internationally acclaimed event
7825827 nothing beats the sounds of the steel pans the aroma of delicious caribbean food and the dazzling colours of the costume parade
7825828 the carnival is the perfect london spectacle to captivate the world with its dazzling array of costumes and music
7825829 this years event was enjoyed by more than a million people as the sights and sounds of the caribbean and other cultures came alive on the streets

7825839 regarding the issue raised in the report concerning guidance on discussing the availability of treatments with patients it isnt appropriate for us to comment on how clinicians should best communicate with their patients or on patient clinician interaction before final guidance has been published this is a matter for local pcts or professional bodies to advise on
7825840 the department of health has issued guidance to the nhs that makes it clear that funding for a treatment should not be withheld simply because nice guidance does not exist

7825971 increasingly we are seeing more of the dialogue focus on bringing these social networking capabilities onto one platform as opposed to questioning whether they should even be a corporate function
7825972 does the vendors strength play unevenly towards certain elements of social computing in other words did they start out as a blog provider and magically reinvent themselves as as a platform play
7825973 you can quantify this pretty easily do they blog are they good at involving customers in the conversation if they havent synchronized their own communications theres a good chance they cant do it for you
7825974 as a software developer i was seduced by the incredible ubiquity and accessibility that browser based apps provided now however im tending towards the view that if its personal private or sensitive it doesnt belong in an electronic medium that was geared from the start towards publishing and not protecting data

7825978 the companion source code for the book provides about a 20k library to access the crm service features from silverlight taking the hard work away from you and providing you with the already implemented work arounds to access the services
7825979 i keep saying over and over that the social platform race is a race to my contact list but there still isnt an effective solution i currently subscribe to salesforce com but paying 55 a month seems like a lot of money to spend on something that isnt extremely easy to use and offers 10 000 more features than ill ever use
7825980 its a deal where for a flat fee can use as much of salesforce as it cares to through 2011 unlimited users unlimited objects unlimited storage etc im guessing this is the first deal of its kind in the world imagine what you could do without limits im kind of drooling right now
7825981 ive had a couple of customers that implemented the salesforce com customer service amp support application but couldnt be convinced to decommission their old support system because they wanted to keep using their existing knowledge base salesforce coms acquisition of instranet is great news and should resolve this objection
7825982 what we usually see is that the customer call center and service departments have one set of data often using crm while sales and marketing

7826078 my director abhishek kapoor was very clear that whoever plays the lead singer of the band in the movie should sing the songs himself if the character is about a singer and the songs are being dubbed then it looks a bit fake
7826079 it is the authenticity factor that comes in between however my singing worked really well in context to the movie
7826080 we have tried to bring a slight respect to the sincerity in our work from the audiences point of view by my singing
7826081 i have been singing and playing the guitar for a while this is for the first time that i have sung professionally and i had a great guide in the form of shankar mahadevan

7826083 it should come as no surprise that a large majority of americans perceive senator obama as receiving more favorable media treatment compared to senator mccain obama is a fresh young and charismatic political figure any politician who is routinely compared to john f kennedy and bobby kennedy as obama has been will surely cultivate support among journalists this will change however once the nominating conventions are over and the general election campaign begins the euphoria will subside and we are likely to see more balanced coverage
7826084 when just 6 3 of those surveyed were unsure about the balance of media coverage for the candidates its a good indication it is obvious to americans but maybe not to the national media
7826085 more than two fifths 44 8 told our researchers that they would be very or somewhat likely to support a strong third party candidate if one emerged this has to be unsettling to both candidates
7826086 with respect to the poll concerning support for third parties it is not at all unusual to find a substantial portion of the electorate indicating displeasure with the nominees of the two major parties and a willingness to vote for a third party candidate this is a fairly typical finding
7826087 however when given the opportunity to actually vote for a third party candidate the vast majority of these disenchanted respondents will balk at the opportunity and cast their vote for either the democratic or republican candidate a good number of those persons polled who supported none of the above will also vote for one of the two major party candidates the united states has been a two party system since the beginning of the republic and this will not change any time soon

7826150 estem vivint un moment pol tic que qualificaria de teranyina perqu hi ha massa declaracions sembla un partit de tenis entre el psc i el psoe que es representa en declaracions duns i duns altres i sempre anem a parar al mateix lloc quin s el comprom s del psc en relaci a catalunya nosaltres voldr em saber si el psc vol mantenir aquest comprom s amb catalunya i si no hi ha acord amb el tema de finan ament o si el que hi ha no s prou bo si el psc est disposat a assumir aquest comprom s amb catalunya o votar els pressupostos de lestat tal com diu el psoe
7826151 les declaracions que diuen que el psc votar els pge les han fet persones que te ricament estan representant el psc tot i que sabem que el ministre corbacho representa el psoe per tamb les han fet persones amb responsabilitats destacades dins del psoe i per tant s el propi psoe qui diu que el psc votar els pressupostos de lestat i a m s a m s diu que el psc s psoe aquest s un dubte que el psc ha desvair i ha de dir si realment s n psoe i si votaran o no els pressupostos general de lestat
7826152 seguirem insistint hi fins l ltim minut perqu intentarem forjar un bon acord per tal que hi hagi un bon finan ament per al nostre pa s
7826153 claredat al psc que deixi de fer aquestes declaracions fr voles amb indefinici i ambig itat ara el que cal s n fets no paraules i cal que aquests fets vagin acompanyats de contund ncia i de fermesa nosaltres estarem amb el govern de la generalitat si aix s aix si hi ha una voluntat un voca i unidireccional danar tots a una per arribar a un bon acord pel finan ament del nostre pa s

7826156 el psc ha aprovat pressupostos que no han estat bons per a catalunya els pressupostos per a 2008 eren uns pressupostos que tenien una manca de recursos econ mics dacord amb el comprom s del govern i amb la disposici addicional tercera de lestatut una disposici amb la qual el govern de lestat no va complir el seu comprom s amb catalunya en relaci als diners destinats a la inversi
7826157 el psc no hauria de treure tant pit en relaci als pressupostos de lestat hauria de ser una mica m s humil i intentar treballar pel seu comprom s amb catalunya defensant un bon sistema de finan ament si no s aix no ho entendr em

7826317 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7826318 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano

7826790 if the objective is to eliminate prostitution and thats what they say it is this will fail

7826802 there may be those who dont like the idea of offenders receiving help
7826803 but these are not individuals who are going to be released because of this treatment they are offenders who have served their time

7826814 therefore we would encourage people to clear out their drawers attics and sheds and bring all old equipment including batteries to their local recycling centre overall ireland is performing well above eu targets and we are delighted with the results to date but recycling levels could be improved even further

7826823 cases like victor stanley okeefe and equity analytics demonstrate that while keyword searches are useful for coping with the dramatic rise in the volume of esi there are limitations with todays keyword search technologies
7826824 these shortcomings are addressed by clearwells transparent search which provides attorneys and litigation support professionals with the ability to test the efficacy of their keyword lists and refine their word selection in preparation for 26 f conferences this added level of insight dramatically reduces processing and review cost while bolstering defensibility to the new levels now being mandated by current case law
7826825 recent case law is driving a sea change in e discovery search and forcing enterprises and law firms to show their work in the courtroom
7826826 transparent search is the first technology that caters to the unique requirements of lawyers and litigation support professionals by enabling testing sampling and iterative refinement of keyword searches as a result legal teams can now devise more defensible search strategies better collaborate on keyword search terms and dramatically reduce false positives and irrelevant documents prior to review

7827036 certainly it is something that is on our radar however putting up one cell tower in open flat country costs us about half a million dollars putting up a cell tower in areas that have geographical challenges can cost more than a million and it is very difficult to recover those costs in a sparsely populated area
7827037 weve asked them in previous years a number of times to make cell service steady and solid from prince george to the alberta border and south on highway 5 at least to the borders of our regional district and they either havent done it wont do it cant do it too expensive something is wrong and what were finding now is analog service in the outlying areas is starting to drop off as of september 5 th and a lot of people dont have access to any telephone lines at all once that drops off they have nothing they have no way to communicate
7827038 the manufacturers are no longer making analog equipment so as equipment gets older and repairs are needed we just wont be able to find the parts
7827039 satellite phones are now much more affordable than they used to be and we are always willing to talk with residents about bringing in phone service on a cost sharing basis

7827091 ive been around long enough to know that you dont look at seven weeks and say its all over and things are back to normal
7827092 the numbers that are available to us see us as the biggest player actually growing ahead of the market place
7827093 the numbers ive been looking at show our competitor growing less than the market
7827094 the mathematics of that means that the gap must be opening
7827095 yes we are looking for acquisitions both domestically and internationally
7827096 rest assured we are going to be very prudent were going to make sure were buying businesses that are high volume low margin businesses

7827108 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
7827109 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
7827110 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
7827111 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
7827112 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
7827113 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas
7827114 the sheer amount of diversity the students discovered surprised everybody strobel said
7827115 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
7827116 clearly the inner tissues of plants are a biological niche for microbial life that warrants further exploration
7827117 it is a niche that can be readily explored by undergraduate students the potential to explore something so completely unknown gets the students very excited about science

7827145 when you consume ordinary noodles made from wheat or corn you may soon feel your stomach empty but this soybean noodle delays such a feeling of hunger
7827146 the operating environment for wine remains difficult supplies are increasing and their brands dont have strong momentum
7827147 but fosters also realized very strong pricing in beer the issue there is the sustainability of this kind of price growth
7827148 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
7827149 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
7827150 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
7827151 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
7827152 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
7827153 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
7827154 it could be like something out of a greek myth
7827155 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
7827156 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
7827157 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
7827158 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
7827159 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
7827160 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
7827161 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
7827162 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
7827163 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
7827164 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
7827165 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen

7827179 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention

7827181 by rule as a delegate i must support the nominee im going to follow the rule
7827182 i wont get to cast my vote my state wont reflect what the vote was that would be very unfortunate if you are going to disenfranchise half of the people at the convention its going to be very hard to find unity
7827183 the largest portion of it is media spin and groups that have no association with her campaign
7827184 theyre groups that are more into making a statement about themselves rather than about the democratic party or senator clinton
7827185 were going to see a rousing speech from her she can give such a great speech its going to bring the convention together and its going to be a united convention

7827248 i cant remember when somewhere around 70 miles per hour was the average speed of traffic on 95
7827249 there are certainly many drivers out there who have taken some steps to reduce the amount of gas they are burning that is one of the few good sides to very high gas prices that if people drive less were going to save lives
7827250 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7827251 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7827252 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7827253 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7827254 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7827255 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7827256 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7827257 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7827258 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7827259 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7827260 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7827261 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7827262 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7827263 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7827264 i think its the number one thing that brings frustration anxiety and knots in your stomach all the things that go along with the injury to the players which do not allow your team to function as it is presented on paper
7827265 those types of things are very difficult for coaches no matter what age you are
7827266 time that is wasted on gaming could be better spent making money so i developed this interesting little experiment to see if i could help these gamers monetize their time from playing and it worked
7827267 i only installed that light to piss off my neighbor
7827268 it was easier to hate the other instead of hating myself
7827269 they walk down the street and theyre like im holding the baby jesus
7827270 if i see one more brooklyn jerk in a brooklyn whatever
7827271 its like they ask themselves where can we go if we have no people skills
7827272 thanks for making this a betting matter rc it gives the question a higher profile
7827273 gives the lie to the notion that there is universal scientific consensus on agw
7827274 even today the fact that a few scientists predicted a global cooling in the 1970s is still used to undermine the credibility of climate science
7827275 long before we run out of oil we will run out of atmosphere
7827276 i see the media in comfortable lockstep with agw proponents
7827277 its a good point though since most top reporters come from ivy league schools where no such requirement exists
7827278 gavin you responded at 11 that emissions are rising at 3 per year while concentrations only rise at 0 5 per year that is somewhat logical because there was already some concentration before we started any emissions
7827279 as i explain the nature study is consistent with the following statements
7827280 everyone recognises that the earth undergoes a warming response to enhanced greenhouse forcing
7827281 actually the media lag far behind the scientists in terms of the level of consensus
7827282 why did gisstemp for march fall from 0 81 deg to 0 68 deg http data giss nasa gov gistemp tabledata glb ts txt this makes the first 4 months of 2008 the coolest since 2000
7827283 in general the object of prediction is to assist the layman and it is the opinion formed by him that decides whether they will suceed or fail
7827284 el nino unlocking the secrets of the master weather maker
7827285 how do we know that recent co2 increases are due to human activities
7827286 evidence shows that co2 is going up at over 3 per year
7827287 the testing took months but finally identified the problem the stresses caused by thousands of takeoffs and landings were causing the planes aluminum skin to crack eventually the metal would completely fail causing immediate depressurization of the cabin and catastrophic structure failure
7827288 as the airplane leveled at 24 000 feet both pilots heard a loud
7827289 the boeing 737 classic was designed with a fail safe structure
7827290 a failure of models to predict correctly does not necessarily mean the model is completely wrong
7827291 an overwhelming scientific consensus has determined humans are responsible for most of the global warming in the last xx years
7827292 i would also like a climate scientist to confirm that in and of itself co2 would block no more than 0 04 of out going infra red radiation a supplementary question would the absorbed energy raise the molecules temperature or increase its velocity or are these one and the same thing
7827293 we ought therefore to agree that pre human or more precisely pre industrial climate change was caused by changes in solar activity
7827294 we ought also to agree that fossil fuel burning industrialisation pumps increasing quantities of co2 plus water vapour and sensible heat i wonder whether the models include these directly into the atmosphere
7827295 the ipcc argues that these effects completely swamp solar ones on two main grounds first the rate of warming in the latter half of the 20th century exceeds all previous experience and second otherwise their models dont make sense well the latter sounds a bit chicken and egg ish to this layman
7827296 on the other side of the atlantic unpublicised revisions to the us temperature record reveal that six of the hottest ten years occurred in the first half of the 20th century
7827297 accordingly it is prudent not to expect continued year after year warming in the near future and in so doing diminish concern about global warming should global cooling instead manifest itself again
7827298 i would also like a climate scientist to confirm that in and of itself co2 would block no more than 0 04 of out going infra red radiation
7827299 a supplementary question would the absorbed energy raise the molecules temperature or increase its velocity or are these one and the same thing
7827300 there could be some cooling in europe and north america over the coming decade as the natural cooling offsets the warming from human activities
7827301 stable and reach the stratosphere unchanged over a five to seven year period following release into the atmosphere
7827302 2004 pointing to where it was at that time the last 200 years are in the tiny little bit of the chart right of the tickmark
7827303 i have difficulty with the notion that any matter making up a proportion
7827304 all waves would pass through an atmosphere comprising only n2 or o2 no waves would pass through an atmosphere comprising only co2 but you imply less than half the waves much less perhaps zero would pass through an atmosphere of half co2 and half n2 or o2 why is this so
7827305 on the other part of your answer to my query i take it that heat would be transferred from co2 molecules to n2 and o2 by conduction
7827306 i have difficulty with the notion that any matter making up a proportion x of a medium can intercept a proportion 250x of waves passing through
7827307 on the other part of your answer to my query i take it that heat would be transferred from co2 molecules to n2 and o2 by conduction and that this would raise the intensity of radiation from the atmosphere to the surface
7827308 downright embarrassing it still seems a little tough for the very heavy cfc molecules to get to the top of the troposphere and then through the narrow gate of the tropopause in a half dozen years but as you say its just a thought i have no studied reason to dispute it
7827309 as to radiation transfer within the atmosphere there are many ways energy can be transferred to the surface its not just radiation
7827310 i would also like a climate scientist to confirm that in and of itself co2 would block no more than 0 04 of out going infra red radiation
7827311 these measurements and arguments had fatal flaws herr koch had reported to ngstr m that the absorption had not been reduced by more than 0 4 when he lowered the pressure but a modern calculation shows that the absorption would have decreased about 1 like many a researcher the assistant was over confident about his degree of precision 8a but even if he had seen the1 shift ngstr m would have thought this an insignificant perturbation he failed to understand that the logic of the experiment was altogether false
7827312 the numerous oscillations between ice ages and inter glacial warming periods also express natural causes most likely related to solar impacts of one kind or another if not what else
7827313 making the case for agw dependant solely on the unprecedentd rate of current warming
7827314 trimmed of the three observation greater than an anomaly of 1 00 and the two less than 0 6 the remaining 20 span the 76 years from 1931 and show an even slighter warming trend
7827315 that there is a warming trend in an inter glacial period is unsurprising that it is so slight given the agw hypothesis and the rapid increase in co2 emissions over the period is surprising
7827316 whether a water reservoir was analagous to the atmoshere pumping water into a reservoir at a faster rate than it is draining out results in the reservoir overflowing
7827317 what happens to all those watts accumulating in the atmosphere as the surface pumps in energy at 1 6 times the rate at which it escapes to space
7827318 ray what you didnt tell me is that as well as the 59 trillion photon gobbling co2 molecules in the air column there are 98 quadrillion photon friendly molecules of n2 and o2
7827319 1 water vapor content of the atmosphere has not changed significantly co2 has increased by 38 and 2 water vapor peters out at the cloudtops while co2 is well mixed and continues to work as a ghg and absorb ir up into the stratosphere
7827320 a photon absorbed into vibration energy of co2 does not raise its temperature
7827321 what makes carbon dioxide so interesting is that the gas absorbs energy in some small segments of the thermal infrared spectrum that water vapor misses
7827322 there are lies and damned lies then there are statistics
7827323 yes jim thats me requesting more time for scientists to sort out their widening set of differences before economists are let loose on the project
7827324 can only be tested by the predictive reliability of computer models derived from the hypothesis
7827325 yes jim thats me requesting more time for scientists to sort out their widening set of differences before economists are let loose on the project
7827326 explanations exist they have existed for all times for there is always an easy solution to every problem neat plausible and wrong
7827327 the scientists found regions where the water was acidic enough to dissolve the shells and skeletons of clams
7827328 challenge to real climate on the ipcc global climate model predictions of global warming
7827329 each time starts again close to the observed climate because it is initialised with observed sea surface temperatures
7827330 since such radiation is the only way energy escapes the climate system that has to heat things up
7827331 i am a loner lacking competence to refute received wisdom as evidenced here over recent days but attracted to those who arent so constrained
7827332 117 ray what you didnt tell me is that as well as the 59 trillion photon gobbling co2 molecules in the air column there are 98 quadrillion photon friendly molecules of n2 and o2 the probability of the photon escaping to space is 0 9994 no

7827366 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7827367 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7827368 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7827371 i feel like its all my fault nobody could play
7827372 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7827373 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7827387 crankshaft connecting rods and pistons are not solid but have channels that allow oil to cool parts from the inside as well as provide a lubrication function
7827388 this was news to me so i dug around a little and found s a patent granted for this system or something very similar in any case in 2006 right around the time of the freezing of engine specs
7827389 initial analysis of the ferrari 056 power unit that blew up in valencia has confirmed that it was a con rod problem the exact same reason for massas exit at the hungaroring
7827390 these valencia changes take on more significance in light of raikkonens engine failure it should be noted that the chimney and winglet on the right of raikkonens car were damaged and torn from the bodywork during the accident with the fuel hose at his second stop
7827391 the bottom line is drivers have good and bad races and im sure he will forget this one but he is more than capable of winning
7827392 so i certainly wouldnt discount him at this stage with only six races to go i wouldnt want to make any predictions about him thats the worst thing we could do

7827409 de vrijwillige overeenkomst van de europese commissie met de autofabrikanten heeft haar doel gemist
7827410 reden genoeg om de vlaamse europarlementsleden op te roepen om hun verantwoordelijkheid te nemen tijdens cruciale stemmingen in september zij hebben de kans om de autoconstructeurs te verplichten cht zuinige wagens op de markt te brengen dat is niet alleen noodzakelijk om de co2 uitstoot van het wegverkeer in de toekomst te beperken door de hoge brandstofprijs is het ook een sociale en economische noodzaak
7827411 aan een tempo van n procentpunt per jaar duurt het nog een eeuwigheid vooraleer de in belgi verkochte wagens zuinig en milieuvriendelijk zijn
7827412 if theres no action before 2012 thats too late what we do in the next two to three years will determine our future this is the defining moment
7827413 a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still
7827414 a number of influential people in russia china india indonesia and vietnam say the planet is now entering a 30 year cooling period the second half of a normal cycle driven by cyclical changes in the suns output and currents in the pacific ocean their theory leaves true believers in carbon catastrophe livid to judge by actions not words the carbon warming view hasnt come close to persuading a political majority even in nations considered far more environmentally enlightened than china and india europes coal consumption is rising not falling and the continent wont come close to meeting the kyoto targets for carbon reduction australia is selling coal to all comers
7827415 youre darned right they are and with good reason but whoa this body of science started settling core questions back when fourier sp asked his founding question in the 1820s and arhennius sp put the founding question to the test climate science is only uncertain how much pepper is in the shaker because it knows very well that the pepper is there
7827416 divert the flow of the river headed toward the waterfall but only to throw sticks in the way to slow the doom
7827417 a number of influential people in russia china india indonesia and vietnam say the planet is now entering a 30 year cooling period the second half of a normal cycle driven by cyclical changes in the suns output and currents in the pacific ocean
7827418 while the basics of global warming are well established and our greenhouse gas emissions are causing the warming with many dire consequences there is still some scientific uncertainty about or debate on
7827419 while human caused global warming is well established there is uncertainty about or debate on
7827420 i simply hate when the line between the research and the politics becomes blurred
7827421 then it devolves into agw promoters and denialists debates people will look at the debate and decide nobody knows whats going on
7827422 i am a skeptic and do not have the knowledge to understand the papers even if i dug though thousands of them
7827423 in his deposition cronkite said that an ethical journalist should resist directives that would result in a false or slanted story being broadcast
7827424 he should not go a microinch towards that sort of thing that is a violation of every principle of good journalism
7827425 dont believe anything you see in a tv documentary made in the uk
7827426 the internet perceives censorship as failure and routes around it
7827427 500 scientists with documented doubts of man made global warming scares
7827428 i cant find what you claim pachauri said whered you find it mandatory doesnt always mean legally required
7827429 an a priori determination not to accept the reality of anthropogenic global warming and an eagerness to grasp at any straw no matter how flimsy to support that determination is not
7827430 why should i bother myself with talking to journalists who might distort what i say
7827431 basically the combination of the transient response and the equilibrium sensitivity tells you something about how fast the climate will change as infrared absorbing gases increase and how extensive those changes will be the transient climate response sets a lower limit on the equilibrium climate sensitivity with the difference between the two apparently due to oceanic heat uptake rates upper bounds are somewhat poorly defined due to the likelihood of positive emissive feedbacks on the carbon cycle as temperatures increase these estimates are global averages actual temperature and precipitation changes in the real world will vary widely with latitude and with region
7827432 so far without a pretty heavy amount of digging that reality is not presented in a clear cut way as you state
7827433 add in people pushing political agendas by getting behind one view or another
7827434 proposed law provides that neither the state dept of education nor any school official shall prohibit any teacher in a public school system from helping students understand analyze and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories pertinent to the course or courses being taught specifies that such topics may include biological evolution the chemical origins of life global warming and human cloning
7827435 they should get off the backs of india and china
7827436 they should say well assist you to move to a pattern of development which is sustainable low in terms of emissions intensity
7827437 remove the remotest chance that religion may be perceived as intruding into his research
7827438 if people were traveling 1 000 miles an hour 1 600 kph the speed at the equator due to rotation dont you think they would notice or fly off
7827439 1 agw is a certainty this is an absurd contention no responsible scientist would ever make my goodness i hope you are not a professor somewhere

7827443 words in italics represent calibrated expressions of uncertainty and confidence relevant terms are explained in the box treatment of uncertainty in the introduction of this synthesis report
7827444 because hes in it for the money if people didnt go to the doctor theyd be out of a job so theyre bound to lie
7827445 journalisms already a lost cause though it will always have some outstanding good practitioners because the journalists dont own the journals
7827446 and how do you intend to reject the null hypothesis
7827447 as a geologist i am somewhat bemused that you all seem to ignore billions of years of earth history
7827448 anthropogenic co2 is causing most of the heating of the planet in the last 100 years
7827449 hang on thats unfair because normal relaxed english is imprecise and you cant therefore use that imprecision as your basis of counterexample
7827450 yarmouth i wouldnt try that if i were you thats maybe 150 miles
7827451 even after i warned you about how far it is
7827452 if you want to convince or sell to someone dont start off by calling him her a dumb stupid neanderthal
7827453 getting their off topic licks in tobacco right wing talk show hosts bush ii corporations big oil etc
7827454 how many here are organic vegans walk or bicycle for all transportation homes are completely solar and wind powered or other renewables
7827455 this is why the leaders in renewable energy development are germany and japan
7827456 for almost a decade we have heard experts saying bangladesh will be under water but so far our data has shown nothing like this
7827457 the rate at which sediment is deposited and new land is created is much slower than the rate at which climate change and sea level rises are taking place
7827458 its not conducive to regrowing them its a one way process
7827459 have any purpose other than to suggest the existence of nonexistent doubt that the shockingly rapid and massive changes in arctic ice are driven by anthropogenic global warming 31 july 2008 at 1 42 pm
7827460 there are some here who are more satisfied spitting out venom and getting their off topic licks in tobacco right wing talk show hosts bush ii corporations big oil etc than converting a skeptic or two
7827461 i can not tell who is right and who is wrong and niether side has really convinced me
7827462 the take home message for me is that these ice shelves are not regenerating
7827463 if were looking at an indicator of whether climate is to blame its really the lack of regeneration that convinces me theyre breaking away so rapidly that theres no hope of regeneration
7827464 pretty strong evidence that suggests this is related to global warming
7827465 i will protect you from those that want to undermine our way of life
7827466 i want my cell phone ipod new car every 2 years and 2500 square foot home for me and my wife with cultivated lawn
7827467 no man ever made a greater mistake by doing nothing when he could not do anything
7827468 what are you personally doing in your life to solve the problem to clarify im not asking about your political actions or activism im talking about your personal choices
7827469 homes are completely solar and wind powered or other renewables
7827470 however everyone becoming vegan is not actually an effective nor practical solution though it would help somewhat
7827471 i cannot stand pv as its a messy toxic disaster i am very pro nuclear power
7827472 vulcan can be used to pinpoint co2 emissions down to the levels previously unseen gurney says the tool should not be used to affix blame
7827473 ten years ago there might have been resistance to the notion of examining who is responsible for the co2 emissions in such a visually detailed way
7827474 however what vulcan makes utterly clear is that co2 emissions cannot be exclusively affixed to suv drivers manufacturers or large power producers everybody is responsible we need to look for real solutions and have a deeper discussion about energy use its not about politics its about doing good science and solving the problem and we can all be a part of that
7827475 lets suppose that i comply if i announce that i live naked in a hole and susbsist on dirt and twigs would you be satisfied or would you simply move the goalposts and take issue with the fact that i exhale co2
7827476 the solar system is warming not just earth so it must be the sun at work not co2
7827477 the final issue i see is that most people dont realize how mind numbingly ignorant they are
7827478 there is a global resistance not to the facts but to environmentalists
7827479 this spectacle of duelling and apparently contradictory science fuels the notion that scientists cant agree on anything
7827480 is this inevitable or can scientists press officers and journal editors and journalists actually do anything about it
7827481 radical enviros scientists in the employ of government and fat politicians with big carbon footprints who want to take over the world
7827482 responsible defenders of capitalism who want to make sure that our economies are not gutted the poor are not trampled and science is not used to create bigger governments unless were really sure we need to act
7827483 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
7827484 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
7827485 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
7827486 the object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his
7827487 quite frankly climate change is very bad news and we need people and bodies in the know to step up to the plate and put their money where their mouth is
7827488 today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7827489 we are all in this together and we all need to tighten our belts and make sacrifices to save the planet
7827490 can anyone here make the case that in order to accomplish mr gores goal that it wont take a governmental and societal effort exceeding any in our countries history
7827491 that the real goal of the environmental movement is massive government intervention in the economy
7827492 i think it is a reasonable statement that meeting mr gores goal would be a more difficult challenge than overcoming the great depression and world war ii combined
7827493 i propose that before this year is out that we commit to mapping the denialist memome in the vein of human genome project all the memes that denialists trot out in place of actual thought
7827494 just because something is difficult does not mean it should be ignored
7827495 this paper examines the factors behind the rapid increase in internationally traded food prices since 2002 and estimates the contribution of various factors such as the increased production of biofuels from food grains and oilseeds the weak dollar and the increase in food production costs due to higher energy prices it concludes that the most important factor was the large increase in biofuels production in the u s and the eu without these increases global wheat and maize stocks would not have declined appreciably oilseed prices would not have tripled and price increases due to other factors such as droughts would have been more moderate
7827496 i do think it is reasonable to make the statement that he al gore does speak for the agw cause
7827497 because we will need solutions and so far only those who favor government intervention are proposing them
7827498 so i will ask you directly do you believe this global warming event is human caused
7827499 the continents will magically rise up and all will be well
7827500 the false positive on agw mitigating it when it is not happening would be a great economic and environmental bonanza
7827501 the resulting chaos could easily pose a far greater danger to the united states than we presently face from saddam
7827502 we have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals
7827503 public attitudes about climate change reveal a contradiction surveys show most americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas ghg emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations or net radiative forcing can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful us policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions such wait and see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident underestimating substantial delays in the climates response to anthropogenic forcing we report experiments with highly educated adults graduate students at mit showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships including mass balance principles that lead to long response delays ghg emissions are now about twice the rate of ghg removal from the atmosphere ghg concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall stabilizing only when emissions equal removal in contrast results show most subjects believe atmospheric ghg concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of ghgs from it these beliefs analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow support wait and see policies but violate conservation of matter low public support for mitigation policies may be based more on misconceptions of climate dynamics than high discount rates or uncertainty about the risks of harmful climate change
7827504 accumulation is a fundamental process in dynamic systems inventory accumulates production less shipments the national debt accumulates the federal deficit
7827505 here we demonstrate that poor understanding of accumulation termed stock flow failure is more fundamental in a series of experiments we find that persistent poor performance is not attributable to an inability to interpret graphs lack of contextual knowledge motivation or cognitive capacity rather stock flow failure is a robust phenomenon that appears to be a function of the mental models constructed and used when encountering a dynamic system we show that many including highly educated individuals with strong technical training use what we term the correlation heuristic erroneously assuming that the behavior of a stock matches the pattern of its flows we discuss the origins of stock flow failure and implications for management and education
7827506 every living dynamic system is tied in some way to all other systems what happens at the macro level effects the micro level and vice versa with resonances equivalent to the relevance of the individual event
7827507 heres the skinny on the revkin item as i read it in context with the what is reasonably understood in the science
7827508 if they scientists had wanted to be in pr or sales theyd be there
7827509 i suspect that projected rates of sea level rise are too great and the risk is that the natural processes can not keep up or even if they do they become episodically overwhelmed by a storm surge
7827510 ill be trying what seems to be an unusual approach in blogs writing to be inclusive of students in middle school and jr
7827511 no longer is climate change a distant drama of shrinking polar ice caps as year round ice fades from the saw toothed summits of the sierra nevada as klieforth and others watch a world change in their lifetimes its clear an unwelcome reality is at our doorstep global warming is local warming
7827512 just as rising worldwide temperatures are sowing problems in the far north and parts of antarctica so too are they bringing big changes to our own northern exposure in the sierra and other mountain regions
7827513 you can see it in the dead rust red pines west of yosemite national park the fading easel of wildflowers near carson pass south of lake tahoe and the parched bare banks of lakes and reservoirs
7827514 you can hear it in the quiet murmur of small streams that once rushed noisily downhill in july in the whoosh of cars over tioga pass after thanksgiving a time when the white knuckle road crossing the highest in california was always closed by snow prior to 1975 and in the voices and observations of scientists resource managers and mountain residents
7827515 the false positive on agw mitigating it when it is not happening would be a great economic and environmental bonanza
7827516 one aspect of sea level rise i have never seen any media coverage on is the impact on fisheries of the inundation of existing estuarine ecosystems will even a few feet of sea level rise terminate estuary productivity will that have a huge negative impact on fisheries and will the re establishment of these ecosystems be more a matter of centuries than decades i suspect the answer to all of those questions may be yes please ask your experts about it
7827517 these are little things in some respects theyre not global warming or genocide but they dont feel little
7827518 im no good at being noble but it doesnt take much to see that the problems of three little people dont amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world someday youll understand that now now heres looking at you kid
7827519 utility companies love evs since they mainly charge up at night during their low peak time the comed guy who came to our environmental group up north was especially happy with they idea of evs since they are 75 nuclear amp operations cannot be shut down at night which means they are not operating at full capacity and rely heavily on coal powered peaking plants
7827520 utility companies love evs as long as there are not too many of them the last figures i saw indicated that a fleet of about 10 evs would balance out the load if recharging at night more than that would require extra capacity at night
7827521 the vocal opposition is mainly from people outside the field who do not understand the science and oppose it because of the political implication they perceive it to have
7827522 this spectacle of duelling and apparently contradictory science fuels the notion that scientists cant agree on anything
7827523 scientists almost certainly would say yes that the earth will have another cold period
7827524 duelling and apparently contradictory science fuels the notion that scientists cant agree increased coverage may actually be leading people to think that scientists are more divided on the basic questions
7827525 is this inevitable or can scientists press officers and journal editors and journalists actually do anything about it
7827526 if you disagree with some point i make or have a point to add yourself then it is a good idea to include a link or full reference to a good source one of the things about doing science is that you dont take peoples reporting as gospel scientists are people and people make mistakes so its a good idea to make it easy for people to check out the full original source when youve described something well they can be thankful for your much better description or maybe they can learn more about the topic wins all around
7827527 mostly its about winners and losers at least in the early phases of climate change
7827528 if youre talking about 1 degree 2 degrees hotter not runaway stuff but what were almost certainly committed to over the next 30 or 40 years there will be countries that get away relatively cost free in that scenario particularly countries in the higher latitudes
7827529 there will be huge falls in the amount of crops that you can grow because there isnt the rain and its too hot
7827530 that will apply particularly to the mediterranean and so not just the north african countries but also the ones on the northern side of the mediterranean
7827531 the ones in the european union like spain and italy and greece and the balkans and turkey are going to be suffering huge losses in their ability to support their populations
7827532 it may mean the collapse in the global trade of food because while some countries still have enough there is still a global food shortage
7827533 if you cant buy food internationally and you cant raise enough at home what do you do you move so refugee pressures huge ones are one of the things that drives these security considerations
7827534 india and pakistan are both nuclear armed countries all of the agriculture in pakistan and all of the agriculture in northern india depend on glacier fed rivers that come off the himalayas from the tibetan plateau those glaciers are melting
7827535 theyre melting according to chinese scientists to 7 per cent a year which means theyre half gone in 10 years
7827536 india has a problem with this pakistan faces an absolutely lethal emergency because pakistan is basically a desert with a braid of rivers running through it
7827537 those rivers all start with one exception in indian controlled territory and theres a complex series of deals between the two countries about who gets to take so much water out of the river those deals break down when theres not that much water in the rivers
7827538 its unthinkable but yet its entirely possible so these are the prices you start to pay if you get this wrong
7827539 some of them actually im afraid weve already got them wrong in the sense that there is going to be some major climate change
7827540 that borders going to be militarised i think theres almost no question about it because the alternative is an inundation of the united states by what will be effectively climate refugees
7827541 they us are concerned actually about losing a lot of land and a lot of crop production within the united states itself
7827542 a lot of floridas basically about six inches above sea level and the mississippi river delta well weve already seen what one hurricane did there plus of course many interventions overseas by the american armed forces as much bigger emergencies occur in much bigger parts of the world
7827543 and its not just the analysts i spent the past year doing a very high speed self education job on climate change but i think i probably talked to most of the senior people in the field in a dozen countries
7827544 theyre scared theyre really frightened things are moving far faster than their models predicted
7827545 you may have the arctic ocean free of ice entirely in five years time in the late summer nobody thought that would happen until about the 2040s even a couple of years ago
7827546 the threshold you dont want to cross ever is 2 degrees celsius hotter than it was at the beginning of the 1990s
7827547 that is a margin we have effectively already used up more than half of it would require pretty miraculous cooperation globally and huge cuts in emissions
7827548 my kids will and i dont think that is going to be a pleasant prospect at all because once you go past 2 degrees and you could get past 2 degrees by the 2040s without too much effort things start getting out of control
7827549 the ocean starts giving back to the atmosphere the carbon dioxide it absorbed that world is a world where crop failures are normal
7827550 where for example australia does not export food any more it is hanging on to what it can still grow to feed its own people but that is about all that it is going to be able to do and many countries cant even do that
7827551 there is a study out from the chinese academy of scientists and then swiftly disappeared again but about two years ago we predicted the maximum damage that would be done to china under foreseeable climate change in the 21st century was 38 per cent cut in food production
7827552 that is only about three fifths of the food they now eat and there will be a lot more of them
7827553 i think we will end up having to do things that at the moment nobody would consider doing like geo engineering ways of keeping the temperature down while we get our emissions down
7827554 het is nog vroeg dus ik ben erg voorzichtig ik rust zo veel mogelijk ik ben zo gelukkig
7827555 ik denk dat ik ongetrouwd blijf en alleen maar kinderen krijg
7827556 ik zou graag een zeilstructuur op poten zetten voor de jonge belgen ik wil hen helpen een hoog niveau te halen ik zal dus niet meer deelnemen aan de olympische spelen tenzij een jong iemand een ervaren ploegmaat zoekt
7827557 als begeleider zie ik me wel nog naar de spelen trekken de sport professionaliseert zich snel en heeft nood aan een ervaren omkadering
7827558 een absoluut hoogtepunt samen met het feit dat ik vanop de eerste rij getuige mocht zijn van de medailles die het estafetteteam en tia hellebaut voor belgi veroverden op de laatste twee competitiedagen momenten om nooit meer te vergeten
7827559 de vrijwillige overeenkomst van de europese commissie met de autofabrikanten heeft haar doel gemist
7827560 reden genoeg om de vlaamse europarlementsleden op te roepen om hun verantwoordelijkheid te nemen tijdens cruciale stemmingen in september zij hebben de kans om de autoconstructeurs te verplichten cht zuinige wagens op de markt te brengen dat is niet alleen noodzakelijk om de co2 uitstoot van het wegverkeer in de toekomst te beperken door de hoge brandstofprijs is het ook een sociale en economische noodzaak
7827561 aan een tempo van n procentpunt per jaar duurt het nog een eeuwigheid vooraleer de in belgi verkochte wagens zuinig en milieuvriendelijk zijn
7827562 vi er enige med regeringen i at der er behov for en n sten neutral finanspolitik men tvungen pensionsopsparing er ikke det rette instrument pensionsopsparing er rettet mod det lange sigt regeringen b r derfor bruge andre instrumenter end sp ordningen

7827565 n r regeringen ikke l gger op til at d mpe det offentlige forbrug s m den ty til genindf relsen af den tvungne opsparing hermed kommer alle besk ftigede til at bidrage til den opstramning der ellers burde have fundet sted i den offentlige sektor
7827566 so hillary clinton gets about 18 million votes in 2008 and isnt even considered for she apparently isnt even given the courtesy of being consulted the vice presidential pick
7827567 will the democratic party which is committed to say the least to gender equity and which in fact has a 50 quota for female delegates accept obamas imposition of a glass ceiling at its convention
7827568 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket and why for speaking the truth
7827569 in a first for me im supporting a republican a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7827570 three weeks ago we made the case that the country deserved to be liberated from the clintons and their brand of politics
7827571 we promised to be the first to say something we are not accustomed to saying to the democratic party thank you so to the iowa democrats and independents who caucused in such numbers for obama and even this hurts for edwards we say thank you you have begun the job
7827572 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you cunt
7827573 the sex ed classes are liberal attempt by the left to indoctrinate children into accepting homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle and to accept abortion as ok and promiscuous lifestyle as the norm

7827613 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7827614 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues

7827654 i cant tell you why they chose not to invest
7827655 a great deal of money had been put into that clinical trial program over the years
7827656 i think that at some point if results arent forthcoming or fda approval isnt imminent obviously appetite for investment diminishes
7827657 basically the fda asked for more data to be acquired and that was in fact under way when the company lost investment

7827663 he was and continues to be my first and most important design influence and inspiration
7827664 there was no price relief in our key input costs in the fourth quarter
7827665 in fact just the opposite occurred with july corn futures reaching all time highs of over 7 50 per bushel in late june and may wheat futures reaching nearly 9 00 per bushel this directly impacted our reported results for the fourth quarter and even to a greater extent than we witnessed in the third quarter
7827666 fortunately natural gas prices have retreated to around 8 00 per million btus from a recent high of nearly 13 00 per million btus
7827667 while we expect to benefit from these lower energy costs in coming
7827668 the major impact on our results for all of fiscal 2008 was from commodity inflation namely the record high prices for corn and wheat combined with the hike in natural gas prices corn and wheat prices for the year averaged 37 6 percent and 63 3 percent higher respectively above our fiscal 2007 levels while the price of natural gas averaged 14 8 percent higher than the average price of natural gas during the prior year the substantial rise in natural gas prices occurred as oil prices exceeded over 140 per barrel for a time during the latter part of fiscal 2008 recently oil prices have declined to a range of approximately 115 to 120 per barrel and as a result natural gas prices have also trended down
7827669 as we previously stated we are transforming mgpi into a leading u s producer of specialty proteins and starches as well as high quality food grade alcohol this has been no small feat as we completely reconfigured our ingredient technology platforms around our customers we narrowed our product lines to drive to a higher value mix we also took the opportunity to rationalize our manufacturing footprint which as previously reported involved the write down of plant and equipment associated with the manufacturing of pet related products and certain of our wheatex r textured wheat proteins that in the future we plan to produce through third parties these actions in total are geared to improving our long term profits and cash flows at the same time the structural and business process changes have created a strong foundation for enabling new growth opportunities in our respective business segments
7827670 although they could have terminated our ability to borrow or accelerated our debt they have elected not to do so at this time and have continued to honor our draws under the credit facility they are working with us to develop our new credit terms
7827671 although they have proposed to eliminate our unused term facility and reduce the length of our revolving line of credit facility to a year at most and tighten other credit arrangements in certain respects they have told us that they will be increasing our revolving line of credit to 55 million we are discussing a definitive agreement with them and expect to enter one in the next few days under their latest proposal we would be restricted from paying dividends and there will be a 60 day standstill period during which time they could review our commodity positions and hedging strategy and measure our performance under new forbearance period financial covenants that would set minimum adjusted ebitda and tangible net worth requirements after the standstill period the banks can decide whether and how they want to proceed
7827672 starting with our gross margins we would anticipate improvements if market
7827673 if i had to pick one thing to point to this past year as tangible
7827674 although our customer list is relatively small in number each one is
7827675 in our distillery products segment pending acceptable fuel alcohol margins our manufacturing volumes should start to build after the current quarter following planned downtime for maintenance and process improvement efforts mgpi has an estimated annual capacity of approximately 130 million gallons of alcohol as we work our way back to full production rates we have the opportunity to better maximize our current capacity which would translate into volume increases approaching 16 percent over the fiscal 2008 level much of the volume will be focused on our food grade alcohol where we remain a key supplier of high quality products our industry reach is wide from vinegar to flavorings and extracts to cleaning solutions to pharmaceuticals to personal care products similar to our ingredients business our future potential lies in capturing a greater share from a relatively small number of multi billion dollar global corporations the fuel grade alcohol area represents only approximately 30 percent of our total company revenues we would expect this percentage to decrease over time as we grow our specialty ingredients and food grade alcohol revenues as with all of our distillery operations our goal in the fuel grade alcohol arena is to optimize the profit margin from corn
7827676 theres no getting around the fact that this was a difficult year for mgpi with a strengthened management team and a more efficient configuration of assets we expect to see measurable results on the bottom line as we execute our plans for growth

7827767 study after study from psychology shows that money doesnt equal happiness
7827768 people are wedded to the idea that more money will bring them more happiness
7827769 when they think of the effects of more money they are failing to factor in the fact that when they get more money they are going to want even more money when they get more money they are going to want a bigger house they never have enough money but what they do is sacrifice their family life and health to get more money

7828072 i found myself really falling in love with science and with the science behind glast in terms of particle physics cosmology and astronomy

7828084 its disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who dont come to the carnival until later
7828085 they dont come to enjoy the floats and the music they come to fight and commit acts of violence
7828086 for two hours our officers came under attack from bottles bricks and any debris that was on the ground
7828087 these people are intent on fighting but innocent members of the public get caught up in it and their carnival is spoiled
7828088 we had intelligence to suggest that people at the oval were from a variety of gangs and that they were on their way to the carnival to commit crime engage in disorder and potentially violence
7828089 some members were arrested for substantial offences such as possession of weapons others were detained to prevent a further breach of the peace

7828136 it is a very good proposal and i cannot turn it down i would like to ask for a million apologies because there is so little time in the transfer window for the club to replace me but it was an exceptional proposal
7828137 rivaldo wants to leave but in spite of what he says he remains under contract to aek until the end of this season and will only go if the club gets a replacement

7828140 a civilian commercial transport boat which plies the yenagoa fropa southern ijaw route of bayelsa state was attacked by men of the military joint task force jtf on sunday august 24 2008 by about 16 30 hrs
7828141 the jtfs explanation of the attack which led to the death of 12 passengers and one critically injured survivor made up of students women and children was that they heard the sound of gunfire minutes before the emergence of the passenger boat
7828142 this unfortunate killing of innocent civilians again calls for the replacement of the military task force with the police in civilian areas it is clear that the soldiers acted out of panic and indiscipline and may even have been drunk
7828143 mend will not issue any threat over this painful waste of lives but will retaliate at the appropriate time before notifying the public
7828144 we call on the bayelsa state government to investigate the incident and compensate the families of the victims as soon as possible
7828145 the house of repres entatives through a member proposed a bribe of 500 000 five hundred thousand usd to a top commander in the move ment for the emancipation of the niger delta mend on friday august 22 2008 desperately soliciting his help to implicate niger dock plc as the supplier of arms and navigational equipment used in the attack on the bonga off shore oil rig
7828146 we did not take this man and his offer seriously until an advance sum of 200 000 00 two hundred thousand usd in cash was delivered to mend camp late sunday night august 24 at 22 45 hrs
7828147 mend has no intention of returning the money which will be put to better use and will not connive with the nigerian government through its dishonourable lower house to perpetrate such a wicked and criminal conspiracy against an innocent company
7828148 this same government also fabricated trumped up charges of gun running against henry okah and edward atatah which led to their arrest in angola on september 3 2007

7828158 wallets and waists are getting thinner as consumers tighten their belts and prioritise what they spend their dwindling disposable income on footfall will drop for restaurants across the uk but spend per head should be less affected
7828159 lower socio demographic groups are more likely to stop eating out altogether 24 of c2ds compared with 17 of abcs and families with high mortgage repayments will also be reluctant to eat out
7828160 there is a wider range of restaurants this time around and much wider choice of casual dining options for consumers eating out used to be a more formal three course meal but is now a habit for many consumers enjoying affordable choice the credit crunch will not change the course of this cultural behaviour
7828161 the good news is that the under 25s who are not tied to a mortgage are still spending and enjoying the hospitality scene in addition the ab demographic will also keep the restaurant cash tills ringing as they downgrade and dip into the varied casual dining scene but continue to eat out

7828206 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7828207 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7828208 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them

7828221 the following athletes have been selected to represent wellington at the nz road champs in hamilton on saturday 6th september
7828222 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
7828223 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
7828224 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
7828225 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so lucky theyre fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
7828226 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
7828227 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
7828228 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers

7828232 in spite of the early termination of the study ati 7505 achieved statistical significance at the studys primary endpoint in the 80 mg twice daily dose in addition all doses tested demonstrated a clinically meaningful increase in spontaneous bowel movements over baseline compared to placebo after one week of treatment
7828233 from a tolerability perspective ati 7505 improved patients ability to experience spontaneous bowel movements with virtually no reports of diarrhea or nausea from the patients in this trial
7828234 as gratifying as these results are particularly when coupled to the recently announced results of the thorough qt study conducted on ati 7505 aryx remains committed to focusing our primary efforts on producing the clinical trial results necessary to partner our other two phase 2 clinical candidates our oral anticoagulant agent ati 5923 and our oral anti arrhythmic agent ati 2042
7828235 while we will seek a new development partner for ati 7505 our partnering efforts will remain focused on maximizing the value of ati 5923 and ati 2042 in the meantime we will continue to analyze the results of this chronic constipation study so they may be presented to potential partners along with the rest of the substantial data supporting ati 7505
7828236 the growing number of lupus clinical trials and the rising level of interest among people with lupus about clinical research led us to the decision to create this new center
7828237 we have already seen an increase in demand for people with lupus to serve as study volunteers at the same time people with lupus have voiced frustration in finding trusted information to make informed decisions about joining a trial the ccte will help meet those needs
7828238 whether to participate in a clinical trial at a given time is a very personal decision
7828239 sometimes it makes sense to participate if current treatments arent working if there are side effects of the treatments a person is taking or just because its clear that without clinical trials there wont be progress in treating lupus but not everyone is a candidate for a clinical trial people need to talk to their doctor but also do their homework to learn as much as they can about whats involved before they volunteer for a clinical trial the lupus foundation of americas ccte provides a way for them to get that information from a source they trust
7828240 level one trauma centers are set up for catastrophic events like car accidents with emergency medical personnel assessing the immediate need of a patient at the scene and then transporting that patient to the closest trauma center equipped to handle that patients needs not the closest hospital such patients are also often transported by helicopter to ensure quick immediate access to quality care
7828241 the longer the time to treatment the greater the amount of heart muscle affected by deprivation of oxygenated blood and the likelihood that the patient will die or be unable to fully recover
7828242 establishing a national protocol is vital and possible stemi treatment is not just the domain of the interventional cardiologist it is a matter of public health policy
7828243 this potent new immunomodulator which is in the same class as thalidomide and lenalidomide will hopefully be successful in treating patients who have relapsed or who dont respond to currently available treatment options we are excited to be testing pomalidomide in this context and are optimistic that it will meaningfully add to our therapeutic options for our patients
7828244 this new clinical trial brings the total number of studies that the mmrc has initiated to fourteen we are thrilled to advance this study in our mission to identify and prioritize the most promising treatments for patients with multiple myeloma
7828245 these results confirm that elesclomol powerfully and selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells by increasing the level of reactive oxygen species ros beyond sustainable levels
7828246 elevated ros levels and susceptibility to further increases in ros are fundamental characteristics of cancer cells that differentiate them from normal non cancerous cells exploiting this special vulnerability represents a novel approach to selectively targeting and killing cancer cells the findings also suggest that elesclomol can substantially enhance the efficacy of certain other anti cancer therapies when given in combination these results collectively indicate the potential of oxidative stress induction as a new therapeutic option for treating multiple types of cancers either as a single agent or in combination we are excited by the potential of this new mechanism category particularly for difficult to treat cancers such as melanoma that have not been responsive to chemotherapy or other prior approaches
7828247 these new findings highlight the potential of oxidative stress induction
7828248 cancer types that may be especially sensitive to this mechanism are those known to have particularly high levels of oxidative stress including melanoma prostate breast ovarian and hematologic cancers
7828249 until now patients suffering from chronic itp have had limited available treatment options many of which are often unsuitable for long term use due to side effects and tolerability issues
7828250 nplate represents the first long term treatment for adult chronic itp patients providing a new treatment approach for this chronic disease
7828251 for those suffering from itp the daily fear of experiencing a serious bleeding episode can be emotionally stressful and extremely difficult for both patients and their families we welcome the addition of new treatment options which offer new hope for the treatment of this serious disease
7828252 amgen is committed to advancing the discovery and development of new therapies for grievous illnesses where there is unmet medical need

7828284 i am pleased that the group found our input helpful and absolutely delighted that couples in the east of england will now be able to access the 3 full cycles of ivf or icsi on the nhs as recommended in the fertility guideline published by the national institute for health and clinical excellence in february 2004
7828285 given the move to single embryo transfer and therefore the importance of patients having access to 3 full cycles of treatment i would urge pcts across england to look carefully as quickly as possible at this new policy look at how it was achieved work with infertility network uk and ensure that all patients finally receive the treatment they are entitled to
7828286 breast cancer psychological distress and life events among young women
7828287 the results showed a clear link between outlook and risk of breast cancer with optimists 25 percent less likely to have developed the disease conversely women who suffered two or more traumatic events had a 62 percent greater risk
7828288 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7828289 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7828290 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7828291 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed

7828337 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
7828338 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
7828339 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
7828340 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
7828341 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
7828342 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
7828343 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
7828344 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
7828345 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
7828346 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
7828347 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
7828348 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
7828349 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
7828350 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it

7828732 we want to raise as much money as possible for the charity which supports firefighters who have been injured through their work
7828733 when we visited the reebok recently phil gartside very kindly offered us the opportunity to fundraise before one of the matches
7828734 we are very grateful to the club especially as steve is a big
7828735 we have the usual bumps and bruises but hopefully they will settle down and we will be ready for what is an important cup tie and a chance to progress in the competition
7828736 alan mahon took a knock last week in training that forced him to miss the reserve game and then he trained on friday
7828737 he was a little bit unlucky to miss out on the 16 on saturday because he came on against ipswich for the last 10 minutes and i thought he did well
7828738 hes an absolute credit to himself though hes on that training ground and he works his socks off
7828739 remcos coming on he played the 90 minutes in the reserves and has now got a fitness base
7828740 what we need to do now is sharpen his feet up for the quicker stuff when the ball breaks in the middle of the park
7828741 hes recognised that himself when i look back over pre season he missed the first 10 days with us and then played the second 45 minutes of our first game in america
7828742 he got a thigh strain and it was stop start from there but hes had a solid two weeks training under his belt now and hell be ready to go when he sharpens his feet up which will be a great boost
7828743 were at home and it may well be that we change the system again maybe one or two come into your thoughts with it being a home game
7828744 so well look at that accordingly see whos got a spring in their step in training and pick the team from there
7828745 ive always loved cup competitions they provide prestige the longer you stay in them and equally financial rewards
7828746 if we were to progress past oldham whos to say you wont pull a plum draw
7828747 we want to stay in the competition as long as we can
7828748 i went to the league cup final with bolton losing to liverpool when steve mcmanaman scored both goals and alan thompson scored for us and we had a fantastic run in the fa cup as well
7828749 people can feel the early rounds are quite tedious but nothing is further from the truth
7828750 its hard to take sometimes that we did do enough to get back into the game but that happens its one of those things
7828751 im pleased with my performance of course but disappointed not to get more out of the game
7828752 i think to get it back we needed to sit tight for the next five or ten minutes and play it safe but things happened
7828753 as a team we grafted so well to get back into the game i think everyone can see weve got a lot of determination about our squad it just shows you how hard we worked to get the game back and we are all frustrated we never got something out of the game and it shows you what were about now
7828754 hes one of these confident players who wants to just stroke the ball into the corner so i was disappointed not to save the first one
7828755 it sounds funny to say that about penalties but i think i should have saved it
7828756 before he joined rangers he obviously got a call from someone to say they were interested at that point he had to sit down and look at it for his family
7828757 its a tremendous club a great opportunity and he will already have worked out the hassles the problems the difficulties of going back to rangers
7828758 i dont think for one second hes come here naively not knowing that when you kiss the badge of celtic and join rangers its a no brainer certain sections will keep that in their mind but hes a strong character
7828759 hes a player who works hard hes a great guy in the dressing room and has a strong opinion im sure hell ignore all thats going on around him and just concentrate on trying to help rangers win the match
7828760 if theres any way of getting the fans onside you put the winning goal in against celtic
7828761 he might have started last week if he hadnt been suspended
7828762 and im excited by a number of the players that weve got
7828763 he swanson has had a really really good pre season for the first time in his life i think hes done all the running hes run himself over the summer maybe he doesnt look it but hes a bit stronger and i think hes a little bit quicker
7828764 so he is a huge part of my plans but hes player in certain games that he might not be of any use to us
7828765 i think he will play i would think a lot of home games this season and i dont know so much away from home
7828766 he might be used more as a sub but im giving you more of an insight as to what my thinking is a little bit
7828767 like today we were pretty solid in the midfield and the longer the game goes maybe people get tired and danny then becomes an influence

7828827 this ad is just factually wrong and red and blue needs to be held accountable for false and misleading advertisements
7828828 to the contrary the citizen initiated and citizen led amendment 2 has nothing at all to do with government action it has everything to do with citizen action stopping the government from redefining marriage against their will amendment 2 allows the people and not activist judges to decide how marriage will be defined in florida this is only the first of a series of ads in an avalanche of fraud and deception that is going to flood the airways in the october
7828829 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
7828830 this hardly seems like unity among democrats on the issue of the definition of marriage
7828831 telling senior citizens that they will lose social security and or domestic partner benefits by voting yes on 2 is outright fraud and preys upon floridas most vulnerable and precious citizens
7828832 democrats are united against amendment 2 in florida barack obama hillary clinton representatives debbie wasserman shultz and robert wexler are all saying vote no on 2 amendment 2 bans domestic partners hurting many seniors and letting government into our personal lives alex sink cathy caster and kendrick meek oppose amendment 2 because personal marriage issues should be decided by you your family and clergy not the government keep government out of our private lives vote no on 2

7828964 hillary often says that bill isnt a complicated person the obama people dont have to do much to make peace with him
7828965 this is hard hard in the most human kind of way theres no doubt about it
7828966 someday the clintons and obama may become good friends for now this is a hard human process making room on the stage for everyone
7828967 kennedys embrace of obama was in part about seeing personal qualities in obama that he saw in his brothers

7828978 i was marking stephen mcmanus on the free kick so it is more frustrating for me that he scored
7828979 it was a clear handball i even asked mcmanus after it and he admitted he handled the ball into the net
7828980 the referee didnt give us a foul but it was so obvious mcmanus just ran in front of a crowd of players and scooped it in with his hand
7828981 i couldnt believe it i could have knocked the referee out to be honest it was a double whammy for us as it was never a free kick that led to the goal
7828982 the ref gave the free kick then didnt disallow the goal i just cant believe it
7828983 there wasnt a lot in the game at that point and wed had chances but they seem to get luck like that all the time
7828984 i am surprised i didnt get booked as i kept having a go at him all the time after that
7828985 were an spl club and clyde will see us as a big scalp but well be up for the match and if we play the way we can we should win the game

7829016 so called pantheistic systems have often been characterized and challenged by the assertion that they abrogate the distinction between good and evil and destroy freedom perhaps one would express oneself quite as definitely if one said that every such system fantastically dissipates the concept existence but we ought to say this not merely of pantheistic systems it would be more to the point to show that every system must be pantheistic precisely on account of its finality

7829018 dr clemens in his first account of the opening of the mound makes no mention of this stone
7829019 if the grave creek find was free from suspicion as to its integrity
7829020 it has undergone so many mutations from transcribers and translators that its value to ethnologists is gone
7829021 did not hesitate to pronounce its authenticity as incontestable regardless of who found the stone or whether it was discovered inside or outside the mound all professed witnesses agreed it had come from the mound
7829022 the characters on the stone by whomsoever they were cut
7829023 are not alphabetical or phonetic if they have any meaning and are not a mere jumble of characters they must be symbolic or picture writing it is therefore of small consequence whether the stone is antique or modern whether it is genuine or a fraud

7829234 weve always had a yearning to do a record that was kind of a straightahead record or at least something closer to a straightahead record than what we normally do
7829235 but its always been very difficult to make that work in the context of what we do on most of our records but a christmas record was sort of an opportunity to really go someplace a little more subtle a little more acoustic and more traditional
7829236 christmas has always been a huge part of my life
7829237 theres so much about it thats universal separate and apart from the religious aspects its a celebration of all the things that are good and redeeming about humanity compassion hope generosity forgiveness renewal family all those things
7829238 it was set up as kind of a jam and it went to some nice places

7829303 the news corporation owned myspace continues to flounder on display advertising often forced to serve low cost flash banners with little brand value or purpose
7829304 facebook told adweek that it was now looking for audience interaction across advertising rather than display ads which take users away from the website
7829305 better insight about users means more effective ads which leads to more conversions and success for your business
7829306 over the last few years web advertising has been all about demand fulfillment
7829307 believes that facebook users arent necessarily seeking to execute tasks or fulfill specific demands and by their nature are less inclined to click on ads that take them away from the site
7829308 the industry has been overly fixated on direct response advertising and delivering impressions and high click through rates
7829309 have mostly run low performance banner and text ads which he said adds to the perception that the category is struggling
7829310 encourages users to interact with brands and share that interaction with their friends without requiring them to visit brands profile pages or exit the site
7829311 monetizing ads across social networks is considered difficult as the content is often considered low quality and users are less engaged and more focussed on internal content
7829312 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7829313 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7829314 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7829315 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7829316 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7829317 i can lead them from a fire tornado and toxic spill we have plans in place for that i cannot lead them from an active shooter
7829318 there are people who are going to think this is extreme but its easy to defend
7829319 look how long it takes the police or anybody else to get here
7829320 if someone wants to come here and harm someone at least we would have sort of defense
7829321 theres a lot of incidents where that would have saved a number of lives
7829322 its unfair of us to ask teachers to take on the additional job of being police officers
7829323 the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good

7829332 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy thepleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible
7829333 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would
7829334 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me

7829987 omvendt m man sige at investeringsafkastet ikke er nogen stor overraskelse det havde man godt vidst og det er ikke uventet at vi f r en opjustering af forsikringsdelen der ikke kan opveje nedjusteringen i investeringsdelen og at vi dermed f r en samlet nedjustering det har ogs ligget i markedets forventninger generelt
