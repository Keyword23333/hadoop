8740015 we are fortunate to have the reins of leadership pass from one outstanding officer to another
8740016 the soldiers of joint stars are the best in the intelligence world and col roberts is the best commander for you at this time
8740017 i was a high school english teacher and baseball coach in dillon s c
8740018 i tell people i got tired of being told what to do so i enlisted in the army when i was 27 i later went to officers candidate school and find myself here 25 years later
8740019 i learned a long time ago that you cant command anything from behind a desk
8740020 so i want to get in the airplane as soon as possible
8740021 joint stars not only provides moving target indicators but it can do forensic analysis in determining where vehicles have been traveling
8740022 it is also a great tipping tool telling a soldier on the ground that he has activity 1 000 meters in front of him it allows them to see over the hills
8740023 the remnants of the hurricane could bring a lot of rain into the midwest and that could be bearish for the grains
8740024 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8740025 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8740026 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8740027 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8740028 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8740029 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8740030 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8740031 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8740032 we cant continue to increase exports while their product is increasing at that level
8740033 something has got to give theyre our customers we want the market but things change over time
8740034 russian protein industries are not developed enough to support the countrys needs

8740037 requires a rethinking of what early urbanism may have been like in diverse and variant forms
8740038 this is an environment in which were likely to get a lot of head fakes both on the upside and the downside
8740039 this is just sort of data that trickles out that can be very positive one day and negative the next we dont yet think it signals a trend
8740040 for all the ones that think this show is bullshit i got chosen as a contestant this morning
8740041 i went to new orleans a few days ago just for the night
8740042 i have a brace that helps me with my posture and i was wearing it and he was looking at me like i was crazy
8740043 i was doing my full dance in front of him but its hard because i kind of have to teach him and im just learning myself so i couldnt confuse him he gets so excited
8740044 if you can see a hole fill it if theres anything that you can see the might not be a hole but might become one in a couple of years time fill it whatever you think might need doing do it
8740045 i hope you dont mind but ive brought my boyfriend because if im here alone i wont understand a word youre saying

8740049 it was brutal i would order my favorite things from restaurants and i would get it and say get that thing away from me grilled chicken or tomatoes would be the worst i would tell my husband to get it away from me
8740050 all i wanted was cheerios it was all i could eat for two months
8740051 shes on a high right now but her life goes in circles
8740052 its like a roller coaster ride shes highly sensitive and just one little thing could set her off
8740053 i want to know how hair grows and how food goes through my body and how my heart works
8740054 artists need to know how the body works and moves
8740055 there is an adage that the best sermons are not preached they are lived if you look at the life of senator mccain you see a life of courage of dedication of duty of honor of character of strength of patriotism in a measure that is epic
8740056 on the question of iraq john mccain has had the guts to stand out on his own arguing for what he thought was right and it turned out that he was right about the surge working to improve conditions in iraq
8740057 hey there thirsty humans our goal is to keep the water as pure as it comes
8740058 i didnt think of him as someone to send out on mechanical tasks of digging out all the cases

8740060 the diaper opened and the baby fell to the ground but at a much slower speed
8740061 the diaper obviously lessened the impact of the fall and saved the babys life
8740062 he could also have been killed by one of the spikes
8740063 rock concert staging podiums that rise from under the floor speaking from a greek temple karl rove could not have concocted worse symbolism for the common man message that obama is attempting to send to american voters
8740064 four score and 7 years ago i had a dream that we have nothing to fear but fear itself
8740065 my uncle was a hindu i dont know why they attacked him and his family possibly it was due to confusion over his religious identity
8740066 all the christians had left the village and moved into the jungle fearing violence the attackers perhaps mistook gayadhar to be a christian and vented their ire on him
8740067 he practiced christianity for sometime but was back to the hindu fold later maybe those in the mob who were from nearby areas didnt know about his reentering hinduism
8740068 the situation in kandhmal is such that christians have started claiming to be hindus to escape communalists rage as such its difficult to ascertain religious affiliation of people many people even after embracing christianity choose to remain hindus in official records for sc st benefits
8740069 he knows our system as a receiver and hes also an experienced returner in this league and did a nice job for us in training camp and a pre season game
8740070 ive just been trying to stay in shape back home
8740071 i mostly did a lot of running because the cardio work is hard to get back
8740072 whether its the first week the second week or mid season its an opportunity
8740073 it opens the road for all of latin america to start visualizing legal paths to abortion
8740074 this tragedy we are living in mexico city is going to spread to other states
8740075 this decision was in regard to mexico citys legislative assembly but in the end it establishes a precedent that can be applied to other local lawmaking bodies
8740076 its not up to the supreme court to legalize or criminalize abortion
8740077 just shows us where we need to direct our effort
8740078 the findings in this report will aid public health and natural disasters
8740079 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the u s specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8740080 they needed a short victorious war and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8740081 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8740082 they were acting in implementing orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8740083 i dont think anyone should be looking for a new cold war
8740084 what we would like to see is the return to the status quo before aug 7th and the hostilities began before russia invaded georgia before the disproportional response to the regular flare ups that happen in the summertime out in that area
8740085 i remember when i was a kid watching wrestling i think jake the snake and rick rude had an angle for a whole year it literally lasted a year nowadays if you can go two months with somebody its like oh my gosh we got a lot out of that one this one has been six months and going with no signs of slowing down its hotter now than it ever has been definitely its one of the best if not this best angle ive ever been involved with in my entire career
8740086 it takes a while for people to get used to a new look a new image and a new mindset when they were getting used to it i changed it up into something completely new and different and not playing the old y2j character that was very sarcastic and over the top i wanted to take it all the way down to where if i talk slow and whisper almost the fans are going to have to shut up and listen to what i have to say because im in control im in control every night i go into that ring every night i say something do something or wrestle im the one that calls the shots not the fans
8740087 its the first time ive ever worn short tights in 18 years its great i love it because everyone is like what are you doing why are you wearing short tights
8740088 i think it was bruce pritchard or it might have even been vince asked me why have you been covering those legs for so long its a very homoerotic sport two half naked guys greased up and touching each other
8740089 i studied acting while i was gone and its come in so handy and made me so much more relevant now as a performer because im playing a character more than i ever have im definitely an actor playing the part of chris jericho when im out there it adds so much to the layering and the depth of the mindsets that i have i honestly feel that this is the best ive ever been on the mic and in the ring as well

8740094 with fernando and the other spanish players there will be huge huge interest in that one
8740095 its great thats what makes the champions league so exciting its fantastic
8740096 the problem is due to interference from outside the region and it is also due to the actions of georgian leaders we believe that if other countries did not interfere then the peoples of this region would live peacefully
8740097 we think georgias leaders should be more in control of the situation and they should stop countries from outside the region from interfering
8740098 all countries from outside the region not to interfere and countries in the region to resolve these issues
8740099 some western powers by encouraging certain political forces and countries and calling on them to join military agreements are harming integration in the region and are creating tension in relations between neighboring countries
8740100 this is how they pave the way for political and military influence and unfortunately their unilateral actions are continuing

8740105 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8740106 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8740107 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8740108 we have to see how many patients are walking through the door to see if we can extend those hours

8740118 desde entonces mi vida ha asumido un significado diverso relat la onc loga desde que estoy enferma tengo ganas de vivir cada instante de mi vida justo porque me doy cuenta de que es nica
8740119 incluso haciendo el trasplante de coraz n a un enfermo se corre el riesgo de matarlo
8740120 muchos en italia est n a favor de la eutanasia para los otros y no piensan en el fin de la propia vida
8740121 yo os puedo decir a adi que cuando uno est sano no sabe c mo reaccionar en caso de enfermedad por esto el testamento biol gico escrito por una persona sana no tiene sentido
8740122 contraria a la eutanasia porque el derecho a la muerte en aquel caso corre el riesgo de convertirse en un deber
8740123 la vida es un misterio la sentimos la percibimos pero no la hemos creado porque es algo infinito y por tanto no medible
8740124 el padre de eluana no quiere la eutanasia de su hija por motivos econ micos sino porque la considera ya muerta
8740125 el verdadero riesgo a adi el profesor es que se corre el peligro de impedir la caridad lo que significar a el fin de la medicina
8740126 la medicina naci en la edad media para hacer lo que se daba en la poca cl sica curar en n poles exist a el hospital de los incurables porque la medicina naci para curar si se impide esto la medicina est acabada
8740127 la religi n es fuente de paz entendida como fuente de la armon a divina
8740128 dan miedo por las acciones de algunos creyentes que han traicionado a su propia fe
8740129 las injusticias las enfermedades las guerras de todo tipo no son una fatalidad sino la consecuencia de nuestros ego smos personales y colectivos de nuestra ignorancia de nuestros errores no reconocidos y de nuestra incapacidad de aprender de nuestras experiencias positivas y negativas del pasado
8740130 no hay paz sin justicia todas las religiones invitan a sus seguidores a la compasi n un creyente no puede ser indiferente frente al hombre que sufre o que es v ctima de los m s fuertes
8740131 los creyentes tenemos la misi n de ser protagonistas de una verdadera y concreta pedagog a de la paz o lo que es lo mismo el primado de la persona humana sobre el estado y sobre la organizaci n econ mica de la sociedad la especial atenci n a la justicia el rechazo de la guerra como medio para resolver las cuestiones entre los estados y el primado del derecho sobre la violencia

8740134 la educaci n para edith stein es el supremo arte cuyo maestro es el esp ritu santo y en el que el hombre es el humilde colaborador
8740135 el arte de la educaci n seg n edith stein
8740136 el inter s persiste en los a os posteriores durante sus estudios en la universidad de g ttigen despu s de su conversi n y antes de ingresar en el carmelo de colonia mantendr un doble compromiso como profesora y conferenciante
8740137 destaca la pedagog a de la santa reformadora teresa de vila sus propios textos espirituales dan testimonio de este inter s por la educaci n que profundiza la importancia de revelar la dimensi n m stica
8740138 la unidad del enfoque existencial filos fico y espiritual de esta autora demostrando que existe una relaci n vital entre la antropolog a la educaci n y la vida espiritual
8740139 el punto focal donde se unifican su antropolog a la tradici n m stica y espiritual de san agust n a teresa de vila y juan de la cruz y su experiencia personal de los caminos de dios
8740140 desde el momento en que ve la educaci n como la formaci n del ser humano en su totalidad en todas sus fortalezas y capacidades con el fin de que sea lo que debe ser entonces implica ya una cierta idea del hombre
8740141 como edith stein escribe toda la labor educativa que se centra en educar a los hombres viene acompa ada de una idea precisa de qu es el hombre su lugar en el mundo y su misi n en la vida as como de las oportunidades pr cticas ofrecidas para formarlo
8740142 considera al hombre como una unidad de cuerpo alma y esp ritu y demuestra que el hombre tiene un interior inviolable que es el fundamento de su dignidad el espacio sagrado de encuentro con dios y inseparablemente el lugar de la conciencia de que pueden elevarse decisiones libres y un verdadero di logo con el mundo
8740143 formar al hombre significa tener el coraje para servir a esta interioridad edith stein da una formulaci n muy luminosa de este v nculo entre el interior y la educaci n cuando escribe es la vida interior el fundamento ltimo la formaci n se lleva a cabo desde el interior hacia el exterior
8740144 educar en una escuela cat lica misi n compartida por las personas consagradas y los laicos
8740145 el desaf o hoy es realmente un desaf o antropol gico qui n es el hombre qu es vivir aut nticamente en el sentido de su ser pero esto nos pone precisamente al coraz n de la misi n educativa que sirve a lo mejor de la persona
8740146 educar es acompa ar el despliegue completo de una humanidad en el cumplimiento de su vocaci n natural y sobrenatural esta es la nica forma en que la sed de sentido que caracteriza a la persona humana puede satisfacerse
8740147 es el supremo arte en el cual el esp ritu santo es el maestro y en el cual el hombre es el humilde colaborador
8740148 la intenci n inicial era la de ofrecer informaci n de la iglesia universal traducir y ofrecer noticias procedentes del exterior
8740149 presentamos noticias sobre la vida de las iglesias de otros pa ses y de las iniciativas de la iglesia cat lica nuestros lectores est n informados sobre la iglesia ortodoxa rusa sobre el patriarcado de constantinopla sobre la comuni n anglicana y sobre el di logo teol gico a nivel oficial
8740150 toda minor a tiene el problema de hacer o r su voz por desgracia la voz de la iglesia grecocat lica ten a muchas dificultades para hacerse o r en la sociedad rumana la apertura de servicios de prensa en muchas eparqu as as como nuestro trabajo on line ha permitido descubrir que los grecocat licos no tienen s lo intereses patrimoniales sino tambi n bendiciones de templos ordenaciones sacerdotales encuentros de j venes peregrinaciones etc
8740151 para muchos es una sorpresa ver un sitio dedicado a la tecnolog a pero nosotros sabemos que ser cat lico no se limita al modo de comportarse dentro de los muros de la iglesia
8740152 los valores que ayudan a mantener los v nculos y los compromisos p blicos y serios que las personas hacen y que no deben ser deshechos por una situaci n inmediata sino teniendo en cuenta los efectos de esas decisiones para las personas y para la sociedad
8740153 muchas voces de las m s diversas orientaciones ideol gicas alertaron al parlamento sobre los errores de fondo de aqu l proyecto
8740154 en varios momentos la sociedad civil se sinti desconsiderada por el hecho de ignorar el poder legislativo los comentarios constructivos que recibi
8740155 en las justificaciones que aduce el presidente de la rep blica sintetiza muchas de las preocupaciones de justicia social que el nuevo r gimen suscita
8740156 esta decisi n es una se al de que es preciso invertir en el apoyo a las familias en la protecci n de los ni os de las parejas en especial de las madres a quienes debemos tanto
8740157 nadie puede autorizar que se de muerte a un ser humano inocente sea embri n feto o ni o sin o con malformaci n adulto viejo enfermo incurable o agonizante
8740158 eran amigos m os gente que yo quer a salvar me dejaron con vida a mi porque soy tutsi pero me golpearon violentamente por traidora

8740161 sabemos que l zaro resucit si no hab is visto un milagro aqu est soy yo todo comenz con un encuentro y este encuentro ha hecho resucitar mi vida rose me ha dado un hombre en el que apoyarme en cristo
8740162 siempre he estado pendiente del renacimiento de la iglesia en rusia

8740165 para resolver los problemas pol ticos econ micos y sociales que atenazan a frica es necesario plantar en el terreno de las culturas africanas un humanismo integral en el que la solidaridad est abierta a la trascendencia
8740166 el hombre no puede vivir en condiciones de vida social econ mica cultural y pol tica infrahumanas
8740167 por esto es necesario afirmar el principio personalista que debe encontrar su expresi n concreta en la promoci n de la dignidad humana en todos los niveles contro cualquier tpo de discriminaci n
8740168 contextualizar las ense anzas de la iglesia en tierra africana
8740169 en lo relativo a la actividad de las iglesias locales la familia y el papel de los laicos as como la pol tica y la econom a
8740170 perspectivas pastorales para la nueva evangelizaci n en el contexto de la globalizaci n y sus efectos en las culturas africanas

8740173 particularmente fundamentales fueron para nosotros las palabras del papa pronunciadas el 1 de enero de 2007 con ocasi n de la jornada mundial de la paz y en las que apelaba a una conciencia ecol gica que se tradujera en programas e iniciativas concretas
8740174 la producci n de estos paneles constituir an el 60 70 de la energ a necesaria en esos edificios disminuyendo as el gasto energ tico los trabajos comenzar n en octubre y la planta solar podr empezar a funcionar este mismo a o
8740175 el objetivo de todos nuestros proyectos es en s ntesis el de crear un proceso energ tico en el que desde una producci n de energ a limpia y una gesti n inteligente de la misma sea posible alimentar en primer lugar los inmuebles y en el futuro tambi n los medios de transporte haciendo sostenible la movilidad desde el punto de vista ambiental

8740185 im sure we all wished it started at 10 30 and they all laughed and she told me not to worry about it and that she would cover everything with me afterward
8740186 theres still a need for us to hear the words of martin luther king to make sure the hope of america extends its reach into every neighborhood across this land
8740187 is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool

8740208 ive heard nothing but good remarks from happy players and pleased coaches
8740209 the football players practiced first and coach said they had some sore legs because the field is new and a little bouncy they just have to get used to the turf

8740211 the anticipation is actually that the facility lifts pride in the programs and with our non athletes as well it shows them we care about meeting the needs of all our students not just the academics or just the athletics

8740254 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
8740255 this suggests that the brain is responsible for the improvement we saw in patients walking ability
8740256 it seems to be recruiting other regions to take on the job of areas damaged by stroke

8740279 if you rap on the west coast its only a matter of time before you grow tired of ice cubes acting skills
8740280 fat joe is the realest rapper ever ever ever seriously that guy eats rocks for breakfast so when complex heard there was a guy on the internet with a site whyigotit com where you could for 10 download a video him telling the story of how he stole fat joes ts chain unfortunately the dreads e commerce game was not on the same level as his robbery game cause when complex tried to fork over 10 bucks to him we couldnt get it to work consequently this so called robbery made as much noise as a tree falling in the forest with no one there to hear it
8740281 because were going to whip that a with warner at quarterback
8740282 thats right man you have nothing to say we have better players at every position then the lowly 49ers
8740283 ha ha are you being serious thats laughable man for starters name me one linebacker on the cards who is better then patrick willis
8740284 patrick willis hes alright man but dansby blows him away
8740285 dude are you kidding me we are talking about the same willis here right defensive rookie of the year last season led the league in tackles the league man not just rookies the entire league
8740286 yeah man we blow you away in the secondary and the line backing position quarterback and running back too
8740287 high msg consumption was associated with a 110 per cent increase in the risk
8740288 will be binding on all federal prosecutors within the department of justice effective immediately
8740289 as an important element of that commitment the revised principles will be set forth for the first time not as a memo but in the united states attorneys manual
8740290 our new policy now makes very clear that no corporation is obligated to cooperate or to seek cooperation credit by disclosing information to the government
8740291 refusal by a corporation to cooperate just like refusal by an individual to cooperate is not evidence of guilt
8740292 we have had discussions with the sec filip said in the press conference
8740293 can make up their own minds were hopeful and encouraged that theyll follow us in this direction
8740294 the new guidelines expressly encourage corporations to comply with the waiver and disclosure programs of other agencies including the sec and epa
8740295 legislation of course would bind all federal agencies and could not be changed except by an act of congress
8740296 the justice departments track record of five different policies in ten years cries out for a permanent legislative solution that cannot be revised at the whim of each new deputy attorney general
8740297 the new doj policy does not address similar offending policies on privilege at other federal ageincies including the securities and exchange commission
8740298 a culture that is seriously undermining both the confidential attorney client relationship and basic employee rights in the corporate community
8740299 my pulmonary doctor told me whatever you are doing keep doing it
8740300 one patient i had had a breast mass from breast cancer it was literally protruding out of her chest and after a few months of treatment the mass shrunk and went away and its been over five years now to where she doesnt have any sign of cancer whatsoever
8740301 how intravenous vitamin c works for cancer cells is it produces hydrogen peroxide just like chemotherapy does and that hydrogen peroxide will help and cause oxidative damage to the cancer cell thus destroying it
8740302 its not going to work on everybody just like chemo or radiation is not going to work on everybody but when you have cancer its certainly worth the effort to do this treatment
8740303 the best evidence of remorse is what you do going forward

8740311 a universal feeling whether well or ill founded cannot safely be disregarded
8740312 i heard about it on one of the local news stations on my commute in that they were offering the chance to drive these
8740313 youre not sacrificing anything and actually for me its an enhanced driving experience
8740314 i think thats a misconception people have that youre puttering around in an underpowered cramped little soapbox
8740315 its allowed people to live with these vehicles in a way that they dont have to feel restricted in the distances they can travel or where they can go
8740316 as i was putting him in the car i was wondering is it the engine noise that quiets the baby or the road noise we had no idea

8740321 if i tell someone it will just make it worse
8740322 bullying is a school problem the teachers should handle it
8740323 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong
8740324 very few companies have this kind of iconic status where anything they do even if it is mediocre will automatically have a halo around it
8740325 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8740326 theyre skimping on materials on testing things to gain market share but theyre kind of pushing away people who have been with the brand even when it was struggling
8740327 a lot better than the alternative in terms of stability viruses being able to do high end graphics work
8740328 i wouldnt tell people to stop getting apple products they make very good products
8740329 sometimes you feel like youre in line with the soup nazi
8740330 its a really good deal to be part of the apple thing and you dont want to say anything to rock the boat no soup for you your apps are gone
8740331 were willing to take less for shipping because we think youll buy five more items from us as opposed to if we got as much as we could from you shipping this product you may never buy again
8740332 i remember the future the award nominated stories of michael a burstein
8740333 starving the arts community has been a theme of mr harpers since taking office
8740334 the latest slashes to arts and culture programs are mean spirited and misguided instead of helping to encourage diversity enjoyment and expression it is apparent that the prime minister wants to continue to harm canadas cultural identity vibrant democracies celebrate free expression and support the arts and democracy is under attack
8740335 given the conference boards recent report showing that seven percent of canadas gdp is due to arts and culture a whopping 84
8740336 mr harpers cuts are not about good fiscal management but his selective slashing does have everything to do with controlling canadians and censoring those aspects of culture he deems to controversial we have seen this with funding cuts and we have seen this with bill c 10
8740337 vancouver centre is a culturally vibrant riding with nearly nine percent of citizens working in arts culture and recreation this is nearly triple the national average
8740338 certainly shifting money away from arts and culture while showering the 2010 olympics with 25 million for the torch relay shows contempt for british columbians in the arts community the olympic torch relay is not culture it is a spectacle
8740339 graphic treatments illustrations that will basically come to life in the film
8740340 weve got plenty of evidence against him king but any evidence will help
8740341 it was a fairly large scale response and so a lot of it had to do with coordinating schedules
8740342 pretty much its all based on if we have some type of specialty we can assist them with
8740343 its so big we just had to make sure we got all the resources together
8740344 im sure theres going to be more like i said weve still got a few ends to tie up
8740345 i dont think its particularly relevant who the running mate is if the running mate is willing to embrace in total the bush mccain economic doctrine
8740346 everyday americans understand that those policies arent working for them
8740347 and if you have one more person out there saying weve made great progress on our economy and that we ought to continue doing what were doing id be eager to have him travel far and wide i think its a losing message
8740348 whoever he picks it doesnt change the fact that its john mccains agenda on the ballot
8740349 he recently told abcs jan crawford greenburg that he owns a 335 000 suburban home outside minneapolis and was quick to note that he still pays the mortgage and cuts his own grass
8740350 a culture of corruption that mr ford wants nothing to do with
8740351 political contributions to the mayor seem to be rewarded in the awards of contracts
8740352 mr zober in a most despicable act virtually threatened to destroy people for sending letters to the mayor in support of pat ford
8740353 theyre saying lower it information technology spending is spreading that is evidence of a global slowdown in it spending this certainly isnt good news for tech overall
8740354 dells outlook is for slower spending especially in asia and western europe
8740355 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected
8740356 its a really tough tech market and dell is obviously cutting costs but it wasnt enough to offset the pressure on gross margin
8740357 what people on the street wanted to see was revenue growth and a solid because if you sell things for no profit to some extent whats the point this indicates that they might have to streamline even more now
8740358 is falsehood not a value that expresses the opposite of truth
8740359 is nullity not a lack of value and thus distinct from falsehood and truth
8740360 is zero not valueless value and thus distinct from falsehood and truth
8740361 if i assert a value where there is only nullity is that not falsehood
8740362 if i assert a value where there is only zero is that not falsehood
8740363 how can i reconcile all that you have told me in the last five days master if i assert value where there is nullity it must be false if i assert value where there is zero it must be false despite this falsehood is distinct from nullity and both are distinct from an object with zero value
8740364 do you ask for the truth or falsehood of truth of value or of an object of value
8740365 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8740366 i think men do a better job than women taking care of that man only bonding
8740367 we were all so different but we just laughed for six days
8740368 i was just incredibly proud to be around her because this was out of her box
8740369 as a single woman i didnt want to be around families and men or kids
8740370 i just wanted to do something that was entirely for me
8740371 it was probably one of the best experiences i have ever had in my life
8740372 my flash of recognition that women would respond more wholeheartedly to adventure trips in the absence of men came on a tour in patagonia
8740373 all of a sudden the women were listening to me ready to explore
8740374 then when we got up to where the men were i noticed they became reserved again so i decided right then and there all my groups would be women only now everyone is open and its the most amazing feeling on our trips
8740375 we take the ferry out starting at the east end of the island spend five days backpacking to the west end of the island and take the ferry back to minnesota
8740376 they do things that they would not do when men are around them
8740377 guys jump right in and do things like setting up camp carrying canoes and starting camp fires
8740378 women are more nurturing and more supportive and say yeah we can do it as a team where male egos get in the way and theres one upsmanship
8740379 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8740380 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day

8740384 ive heard rumors that thats happening but theres no confirmation of that at this point
8740385 i think mez is a potentially good young defenseman who had a bit of an off year this past year and weve asked their camp to entertain that in what were trying to do with him
8740386 i think weve made more than a fair offer and put ourselves in a position where he could come here and with some help we think he can be a top player
8740387 we need their camp to help us in that area as well ive tried to get that message across but to this point we havent gotten there

8740394 what the h are you talking about for a deal this size its completely normal
8740395 when trading you are committing your money to something that you have no control over so you have to do it in a way to keep yourself out of trouble you need a system to help you in volatile markets

8740426 by having a digital connection designers avoid the power and signal losses associated with transmitting analog signals in audio systems
8740427 also the system noise and other faults inherent to analog transmission are eliminated to greatly improve sound quality plus integrating codecs with audio processors on the same silicon simplifies design and cuts board space requirements
8740428 this integrated internet audio processor approach provides cost savings due to a lower bill of materials bom and substantially reduced power consumption
8740429 three things contribute to the overall reduction in system power consumption

8740522 the panoptic gaze is purely assessing purely judgmental there is no sense of glory in being the object of its focus no room for triumph or for the display of family lineage no assignment of exemplarity to be handed down for posterity at rome these were the rewards for subscribing to the shared values of the community and performing them in the flesh at least during the republican period one of the most salient aspects of the transition to empire was precisely the breakdown of these rewards and the breakdown too of the reciprocity f the gaze along with this went a breakdown in the distinction between safe and unsafe forms of visibility

8740526 it hit so fast and so furious and so cruel i mean one minute you have her and the next you dont
8740527 somewhere along the line something happened we cant even get to the grief stage yet because we dont even know what to think where to begin
8740528 we have an unwavering commitment to keep our food safe and we have excellent systems and processes in place but this week its our best efforts that failed not the regulators or the canadian food safety system
8740529 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world
8740530 this is a terrible tragedy and the system failed we will fix it
8740531 canada has one of the most stringent food safety systems in the world but it can always be better thats why we are investing 113 million in canadas food and consumer action plan and hiring 200 more inspectors
8740532 now if you replace world with country she seems to really be saying the same thing that got her so much trouble before
8740533 there are places around city where a sidewalk has to be closed due to safety considerations

8740549 surge la sospecha de que alguien en estados unidos ha provocado intencionadamente este conflicto para agravar la situaci n y dar preferencia en la lucha competitiva a uno de los candidatos por el puesto de presidente de eeuu

8740557 the man was called down and he was initially quite surprised when he was told the officials suspected him of carrying explosives he burst out laughing and opened his bag to reveal three bottles of honey to reassure the officials that he wasnt lying he drank about 10 from one bottle and also offered it to the officials however they declined to taste it and also refused to let the passenger carry the bottles with him
8740558 he tried arguing with the security staff but to no avail since the system showed the bottles contained explosives the officials were not willing to take a chance even though the passenger had proved that the bottles contained nothing but honey he got so furious that he even threatened to file a case against the management in singapore
8740559 a screener has about 20 seconds at one level to scan the image of the bag and decide if it can pass through or not there is an extremely small margin of error in this particular case there is also a strong chance that the screener did spot explosives but accidentally isolated the wrong bag

8740632 at the end of the week unfortunately the tournament could be won or lost by luck on the greens
8740633 the guys going for the ryder cup are the people i feel really sorry for there is a lot riding on that
8740634 they are going to be feeling pressure as it is and you dont want to be standing over a three footer with so much doubt in your mind not knowing if the ball is going to run straight
8740635 the greens are not overly smooth but i felt i was a little bit unlucky every time i hit it in the rough i got a bad lie
8740636 i dont think ive blown myself out of it i could have done but i didnt
8740637 even if someone has to cart me into the car on sunday and ive done all i can i can be pleased and proud of myself

8740641 i found my weapons on the court and i know when to use them
8740642 ive been working a lot on every shot i spend a lot of time on my conditioning if im faster it helps me to play my game to be aggressive on the court
8740643 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8740644 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8740645 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8740646 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion

8740660 sex with students is bad but why should it be the case that for women its a case of poor boundaries and for men its hardcore brutal predation of the most evil sort
8740661 most of these women experts say dont go into teaching with plans to seduce a child the way a classic pedophile does what leads to their downfall is emotional immaturity
8740662 these teachers have a poor concept of boundaries so they dont recognize when theyve crossed the line into inappropriate behavior
8740663 in a lot of these cases the woman thinks she has fallen in love
8740664 but most of these women come from conflict ridden families where they didnt learn healthy social skills many learned to get their emotional needs for love attention approval met through sexual behavior
8740665 i see her as a really hurting adult who needs help i just hope she can get it
8740666 she was demoralized and feeling empty inside and he was the one to whom she could turn her attention

8740672 some of hillary clintons most fervent supporters are taking their enthusiasm and their campaign contributions to john mccain more than 85 of clintons fundraisers including donald trump univision chief executive joseph uva cable mogul charles dolan philanthropist norma hess and one of floridas biggest lobbyists appear to be skipping barack obama when it comes to writing checks for the general election according to an abcnews com review of campaign finance records these clinton donors have contributed at least 200 000 to mccains campaign in the last few months an amount which doesnt include larger contributions to the republican joint fundraising committees
8740673 it was a minor injury on the big scale of things
8740674 i had a great time it was great to see some of the guys that i played with
8740675 everybody looked pretty good actually i mean you never know i was 23 at the time when we won that championship but some of the guys were 32 33 i didnt know what to expect i didnt know if theyd fallen out of shape or how old they looked and they actually looked great so theres hope for me in years down the road too i guess life gets easier when you stop playing hockey
8740676 it contributed a lot to my career at the time that i went over to finland i dont know exactly how it had happened but i wouldve had a hard time breaking in here which i still ended up doing
8740677 just the credit that that one year in finland helped me to get my next opportunity and add it to the resume i think it ended up being a pretty big piece overall
8740678 its a new year weve got to start all over again making sure everybody buys in and it should be easier having a team that basically everybody bought in the year before
8740679 but definitely the experience of being in the playoffs and seeing what its really all about and what people have been talking about because id been in the playoffs in finland and everybody was like youve got to make it to the playoffs
8740680 basically i thought that id be able to relate to the whole playoff experience but when i got there it was actually above and beyond anything i ever dreamed of once you get that it starts a fire in you that makes you want to get back there over and over again

8740701 if its against the law arrest me if you can handle it undress me
8740702 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refused to consider any smear or attack off limits
8740703 these comparisons are outrageous and offensive and have no place in the political process we hope that john mccain will offer a similar condemnation as his allies increasingly practice sleazy swift boat politics

8740707 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear
8740708 it would be nice if i could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying they were getting bad images of themselves

8740751 weve made a lot of progress making missouri roads smoother and safer in just a few short years
8740752 these new statistics are just beginning to reflect how the early completion of our smooth roads initiative in 2006 and the better roads brighter future plan now under way are making a big difference in the quality and safety of our transportation system as a result 78 percent of our roads are now in good condition
8740753 these highways are some of the most heavily traveled in the state and bringing them up to good condition was a top priority for us
8740754 were committed to putting dollars into transportation improvements rather than overhead costs
8740755 weve whittled our administrative costs down to about 3 percent of our budget
8740756 bridges remain a top concern not only in missouri but also across the nation
8740757 through the safe amp sound program we will improve 800 deficient bridges in five years once finalized this program will quickly improve the condition of many of our smaller bridges

8740785 cuando vieron que empezaron a traer los perros pues muy preocupados me fueron a decir oye que saquen los perros porque d nde vamos a meter las cosas las van a oler y bueno terminamos solucion ndolo meti ndolo debajo de unos colchones yo no me di cuenta de eso hasta que termin toda la bronca
8740786 retiro lo dicho y no estuvo bien que lo dijera no me consta no lo vi y eran los rumores que hab a pero no lo vi entonces retiro lo dicho y espero que lo comprendan as fue un error haberlo dicho asumo mis errores y puede ser una irresponsabilidad haberlo dicho
8740787 ni las vio ella ni nadie yo quiero decir que cuando entraron los perros yo me di mi anuencia a que entraran los perros y evidentemente no se encontr nada pero no s lo eso yo lo nico que puedo decir es mi extra eza por ese tipo de declaraciones

8740802 no creo que es un factor mental la falta de contundencia de los atacantes s lo es algo extra o que pasa en el futbol pienso que jugamos mejor en el primer tiempo aunque en el segundo marcamos dos goles
8740803 nada me sorprende me gusta el futbol ser criticado es as hay que tener paciencia gan el juego que es lo m s importante ante honduras durante los 90 minutos en muchos momentos jugamos buen futbol ahora va ser mejor y van a estar bastante contento

8740813 the political consequences of the economic mood may seem modest but given the close nature of the national race between the conservatives and the liberals a few percentage points make a difference
8740814 any evidence that pessimism may have peaked at least for the moment is good news for the harper conservatives
8740815 the economy has become a more important or at least more prominent issue
8740816 but is hasnt yet become a highly politically polarized issue
8740817 when i say people talk about a technical recession even if thats true i dont think its a real recession
8740818 somebody said a recession is you know when people start losing their jobs and when your neighbour starts losing his job and there are job losses but overall employments pretty stable
8740819 while pessimism has declined it has not yet been replaced by growing optimism the analysis said noting that there was no statistically significant gains in optimism since the spring survey suggesting that
8740820 while not a groundswell of optimism it is encouraging that confidence did not continue to falter and even rose modestly
8740821 a pause in the overall downward trend in consumer confidence is a welcome sign but confidence continues to be soft as we head into the important fall season for retailers
8740822 this time last year canadians living west of the province of ontario had a confidence level that was 10 points higher than their eastern counterparts
8740823 we are still working around the clock to ensure all recalled products are removed from institutions and retail locations and held under cfia detention
8740824 we have now checked approximately 15 000 institutions distributors and retailers and can say that affected products are being removed thanks to the heightened public awareness this is the best indicator that the recall process is working well
8740825 assurances by the minister and cfia officials that inspectors daily presence and direct oversight of product sampling are required do not apply to processed meats sold in canada
8740826 these higher standards are required for processing plants to have access to u s consumers
8740827 these cases are positive for listeriosis but genetic fingerprinting results are required before they can be determined to be linked to the outbreak strain
8740828 certainly if asked we are going to try produce enough to narrow the gap but certainly we wont be able to produce the global demand
8740829 perhaps in the future you wouldnt want to have all of the worlds reactors or most of them shut down for maintenance
8740830 i would hope the canadians look into how to be more co ordinated on a worldwide level because what this documents is that medical isotope production is not unique to any specific country and should be viewed as a world resource
8740831 this is a cumulative situation where we cannot maintain a patchwork approach to isotope production and supply
8740832 we are concerned there is currently no reliable long term isotope supply solution to meet this growing demand

8740842 the united states shares canadian concerns about the protection of the arctic environment and we enjoy a co operative relationship on a wide range of arctic issues
8740843 in terms of the latest announcement of prime minister harper we will be discussing the proposal with canada
8740844 we will want to ensure that any enhanced protection of the canadian arctic marine environment is achieved in a manner that is consistent with the international law of the sea
8740845 itll be interesting to see i expect that some countries may object
8740846 i think it ultimately is in everybodys interest to ensure there is some kind of authority in the area some kind of environmental and commercial authority we have no particular power play here
8740847 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8740848 the rising global demand for energy and mineral resources has sparked a so called cold rush of countries to the arctic region and with the retreat of the polar ice pack record numbers of ships are plying our northern waters
8740849 canada must therefore move quickly to affirm and protect its sovereignty over the archipelago including the navigable waters within it

8740852 it looks like they are getting ready for the emperor to arrive
8740853 the facade is metaphor for production purposes but theres not much behind it its the perfect metaphor for barack obamas readiness to be president of the united states
8740854 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
8740855 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8740856 some of them were decapitated some did not have a hand each body was photographed
8740857 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8740858 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8740859 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam
8740860 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do as a senator he has shown his independence on several issues but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years a philosophy we never had a real chance to see in action until 2001 when the republicans finally gained control of both the white house and congress then we saw what would happen to america if the policies they had talked about for decades were implemented
8740861 they took us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 1 2 million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance
8740862 now in spite of all the evidence their candidate is promising more of the same more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8740863 watch charlie gibson diane sawyer amp george stephanopoulos at the democratic convention tonight at 10pm et on abc
8740864 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
8740865 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
8740866 now before the feast of passover jesus knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the father having loved his own who were in the world he loved them to the end
8740867 thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart thou shalt in any way rebuke thy neighbour so thou shalt not bear sin on his account and thy hand shall not avenge thee and thou shalt not be angry with the children of thy people and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself i am the lord
8740868 gay activists and their allies have made no secret of their strategy to convince bible believing christians and jews that homosexual behavior is no longer sinful in god s eyes
8740869 this false doctrine is playing out in denomination after denomination with increasing discord
8740870 christians are not called to rewrite the bible in order to love our gay friends and neighbors true love does not sacrifice the truth
8740871 an unconditional welcome to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities
8740872 increase the number of people of faith supporting equality for lgbt people
8740873 our biblically based opposition to the normalization of homosexuality and the affirmation of homosexual behavior should not hinder us from ministering to homosexuals and offering them the love and healing environment they need to leave this destructive and unbiblical lifestyle
8740874 i dont have a problem with people expressing their points of view in public
8740875 i would prefer that there was serious tolerant dialogue that might emerge from this publicity campaign because it is much needed

8740884 the world is running out of ip numbers and there is a growing urgency for new zealand to formulate a transition plan from ipv4 to ipv6 government should be providing more of a leadership role in this regard
8740885 however the society maintains that the convergence of broadcasting communications and it is occurring at such a rapid pace that the government needs to seriously consider combining all of these policy functions into a single ministry
8740886 it is applications that are going to drive new forms of content and we support the goal of leveraging emerging opportunities in digital content

8740892 i read in hustler everybody should have sex with a vampire at least once before they die
8740893 what i was trying to describe was a side effect of art and art as a kind of drug that numbs your senses
8740894 art might become a drug for an artist but i am not convinced that it is necessary for all artists
8740895 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world

8740901 its almost an exclamation point on the pronounced ice loss weve seen in the past 30 years
8740902 losing summer sea ice cover by 2030 is not unreasonable
8740903 the strong reduction in just one year certainly raises flags that the ice in summer may disappear much sooner than expected

8740907 this storm is fairly priced into the market explains addison armstrong director of market research at tradition energy
8740908 and there are a lot of competing theories to how this thing is going to play out
8740909 this is too fast of a trade for most investors
8740910 no one other than a professional trader whos sitting in front of a screen is fast enough for this trade
8740911 it looks like weve formed a bottomed right around 111
8740912 we can very easily slip under the 100 day moving average which is right around 110 and technically the market could roll to 100

8740920 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8740921 sparse capacity means that every barrel of oil lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner

8740923 in the deep ocean there is a strong interaction between viruses and prokaryotes which helps sustain the deep sea ecosystems independently of the nutrient inputs coming from the surface waters
8740924 its a sort of self sustaining mechanism helping the ocean depths to overcome severe nutrient limitations
8740925 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8740926 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8740927 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8740928 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8740929 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia

8740936 richard foster has done well there so ive told jared he wont come in straight away but hes in the squad
8740937 foster was probably our best player against ayr in the co operative insurance cup
8740938 we are not going to go through a whole season without injuries and the loss of form so jared will help us there
8740939 we have a couple of irons in the fire and we are waiting by the phone to hear from clubs down south
8740940 josh is now in the middlesbrough squad while sone is the same now that he has returned to birmingham

8740943 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8740944 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8740945 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8740946 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8740947 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8740948 my imagination makes me human and makes me a fool it gives me all the world and exiles me from it
8740949 now the team can focus on next year theyll have money a new stadium and a good group of stars i suspect they wont be down for long
8740950 there is going to be a lot going on this off season
8740951 but instead of screaming and hollering there was only head scratching and shoulder shrugging after perhaps the yankees most discouraging loss of the season a loss that made it more likely that this final season at yankee stadium will not include a playoff appearance by this 207 million team
8740952 i ve put together a club that is where its at and im responsible for that
8740953 were not getting what we need to from everybody that we expected if i knew why then i would have fixed it unfortunately its my job to put it together and fix whats broken i havent been able to figure that out if i could have i would have by now
8740954 well they have money so they dont deserve it i want to build my mom a house so i deserve it more
8740955 well they have money so they dont deserve it i want to build my mom a house so i deserve it more
8740956 well they have money so they dont deserve it i want to build my mom a house so i deserve it more

8740963 it aint just the speed its the heart you want something thats not afraid to compete half these horses are just show ponies you want something thats not gonna run from a fight
8740964 a lot of people have had questions about it whove booked places for this weekend and beyond i talked to a guy who rented a home on 29th street for the middle two weeks of september bringing his whole family here and he said his wife was thinking of doing a cancellation
8740965 this was something that avalon did not bring on to itself it could have happened on any beach anywhere
8740966 the process has taken a lot of time first it took time serving judicial summons to the defendants and then we had to gather damage claims from the complainants
8740967 celebrities dont have to worry about family budgets but we sure do
8740968 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun a verb and 9 11 is rapidly becoming true about john mccain as well just replace
8740969 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell
8740970 i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out

8740972 i have a speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys
8740973 here we were eating lunch and it was like the clouds parted and the sun was shining
8740974 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production
8740975 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8740976 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8740977 as a conservative who kind of woke up when i heard ron in the early debates and then i gave money and went to his rally in nashville i appreciate your site and check it on a daily basis
8740978 i just find it fascinating that as political junkies we have basically the exact cable tv watching habits
8740979 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8740980 forces no one against his will into the structure of the state whoever wants to emigrate is not held back when a part of the people of a state wants to drop out of the union liberalism does not hinder it from doing so
8740981 it is a very significant fact that the adversaries of the trend toward more government control describe their opposition as a fight against washington and against berne i e against centralization it is conceived as a contest of states rights versus the central power
8740982 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8740983 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8740984 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader

8740988 when the officer came up to my window he asked the typical police requests registration drivers license insurance card
8740989 i asked him why he was pulling me over and he said because of the bumper sticker on my back window

8740991 vladimir ilyich lenin ulyanov said at one point russia matters nothing to me what matters is to achieve world socialist revolution
8740992 we always stand ready to bring additional relief to the market if its necessary
8740993 the big natgas storage build is lending a bearish tone to the market even as everyone is still watching gustav closely

8740998 weve been recently made aware of some allegations of misconduct
8740999 ill bet you it was someone connected with the army air forces
8741000 they had to have the materials to make this and i doubt somebody in the infantry would
8741001 the officers brought it in and didnt give it a second thought
8741002 it was just a gun theyre in their 20s and 30s to me it runs a little deeper i recognized immediately that the photo was from the 40s
8741003 if we can find the woman then we can find out who the man was who owned this gun
8741004 id like to find the nearest museum near them and put it in there with his and her whole story
8741005 and if i can find out where it was stolen then i can put a case on the guy we took it from for stolen property thatd be good too

8741010 i think he obama could have sent a signal to say i want this tamped down
8741011 significantly change the way conventions are funded in the future should he be elected
8741012 barack obama is committed to reforming our political system and getting the special interests out of politics
8741013 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
8741014 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
8741015 to secure our energy supplies and power our homes it is important industry brings forward new energy infrastructure to maintain a diverse energy mix its also important that as we face the challenges of climate change we move towards more efficient energy production and this power station is an example of that

8741019 if it is not ratified by congress by july end when senate goes into recess there is no prospect
8741020 if we do not have the deal now it is highly unlikely that the next president will present the same deal to india
8741021 the question most americans want answered about iraq is this when will our troops come home we already know the likely answer in 2006 they will begin to leave in large numbers in 2007 a significant number of the remaining 100 000 will follow we cannot sustain 150 000 americans in iraq without extending deployment times even if we could our large military presence while still the only guarantor against total breakdown is increasingly counterproductive
8741022 no strategy for success in iraq his plan is to muddle through and hand the problem off to his successor
8741023 as long as there is a single troop in iraq i know if i take action by funding them i increase the prospect they will live or not be injured i cannot and will not vote no to fund them
8741024 abject failure to explain to the american people that poor people were hurt but so were middle class families and rich people it was a staggering loss to everyone it was an equal opportunity destroyer
8741025 why is it important to me and the answer is because we are an american city
8741026 311 for information on buses out of town 700 buses they say will be at 16 pick up spots so the official plans say to ferry a big whopping 30k out of town but no one knows where the bus stops are

8741285 ill give blagojevich my advice which ive been giving for a long time which is to practice a politics of reconciliation not confrontation and conflict
8741286 thats my approach his approach is different if he wanted my advice thats what i would give him now would he take it i dont know
8741287 sen meeks has spoken to me hes asked if i would be willing to attend a meeting with he and the governor and sen jones and i said i would be
8741288 but im waiting for the setting of the date and the time
8741289 ill have a sit down and talk with meeks and try to explain things to him he may be looking for a pole to slide down
8741290 it is with great regret that we announce the departure of paul holland as manager of mansfield town football club with immediate effect
8741291 we would like to thank paul for his efforts and wish him every success in the future
8741292 de andere teams lijken me ongeveer gelijkwaardig daarentegen weten we over deze ploegen ook niet heel veel we zullen dus op pad moeten om de tegenstanders te bekijken
8741293 i think at my age of 22 i need to be playing regularly after a couple of years when ive been in and out of the first team
8741294 i need to get into the groove i spoke to the manager here and he was really keen to have me as a player you need to feel clubs want you
8741295 he has given me an opportunity to do my best i can see the club has got ambition to get as high as they can
8741296 it would be a great achievement to get promoted into the football league again
8741297 i actually came down here when i left spurs for a couple of days on trial at the time brian talbot was the manager and he already had a couple of good keepers
8741298 being a local lad i wanted to sign unfortunately things didnt work out back then for different reasons and instead i moved to lincoln where ive had a fantastic time
8741299 hopefully by coming to diamonds i can get back to my best and prove a point to those people who have let me go
8741300 i wanted to do a deal because im from this area and also the facilities are first class as soon as the club showed an interest they stood out from all the other options
8741301 alan has a wealth of experience in the football league and has been a big part of lincoln citys promotion push over the last few seasons he will no doubt prove to be a massive asset here at nene park
8741302 dean started his career at arsenal before playing for the first team at gillingham and ipswich town and subsequently inverness
8741303 he has pace in abundance and can play either in wide areas or up front and will no doubt cause our opposition problems on the park this coming season
8741304 jag ser i dina gon vad du vill ha s ttet som du tittar p mig och du ska f det
8741305 varf r gick du inte av bak samtidigt som jag
8741306 nej det k nns inte bra jag m ste g ut genom samma d rr som jag kom in genom
8741307 men vad d k nns inte bra hur menar du m ste har du tv ngstankar jag har ju m rkt hur du rycker i d rren p mornarna
8741308 ive heard nothing but good remarks from happy players and pleased coaches
8741309 the football players practiced first and coach said they had some sore legs because the field is new and a little bouncy they just have to get used to the turf
8741310 i suspect it certainly wont hurt but im probably the wrong guy to ask
8741311 the anticipation is actually that the facility lifts pride in the programs and with our non athletes as well it shows them we care about meeting the needs of all our students not just the academics or just the athletics
8741312 thats really an initiative our students want to see and are pushing
8741313 its important to everyone at the university that we reduce our carbon footprint as much as possible
8741314 we couldnt bear to part with that much history and heritage
8741315 if you were to meet him you would think this person is unique this person is special
8741316 i can say without reservation that he is one of the most dedicated teachers i have ever had or known
8741317 he instills a love of learning in his students and most importantly a love of country
8741318 i guess because we were studying government he wanted to give us a title of respect
8741319 it was our way of recognizing the tremendous service he provided maine east high school
8741320 he just personalized his instruction particularly in government so that it engaged students in learning about the whole process
8741321 today we are known as a place for high fashion and its because of her
8741322 my over arching goal is to raise ebays profile within the fashion business
8741323 my job is to be out and about with my ear to the ground for the buyers and sellers who come to ebay
8741324 before constance ebay was primarily known for vintage and used clothing
8741325 today we are known as a place for high fashion and its because of her
8741326 designers before had never encountered anything like it threatening their safety and affecting their value system
8741327 we needed a person who would be able to look at everything and bring the fashion story to the surface for us
8741328 it didnt last very long ive been waiting for someone like him ever since
8741329 judging from the bush years and what thats actually brought which we all know i think people see that its exactly the same with gop nominee john mccain so i think its a fair assessment that the uk is for obama
8741330 its not just with the words and all his wonderful speeches but his action
8741331 i think hes going to roll up his sleeves and youll think hes like franklin delano roosevelt
8741332 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8741333 im hoping to speak to a player and well see what comes of it
8741334 it may be a bit more drawn out than the others as he is still at a club but im not sure they want to keep him
8741335 look at her lovely teeth she has gorgeous teeth this one
8741336 uncle paddy is going to sweden and he wants a big bed
8741337 were starting from scratch theres only five or six players left the rest have gone for some reason
8741338 if we had the same squad of players as last year and you come in as new manager then you should be able to bounce straight back
8741339 you cant guarantee that youre going to do it it took doncaster six years to get out of the division it took hereford 10 years to come back and it took accrington stanley 44 years halifax town went into oblivion
8741340 you cant say and you cant guarantee that youre going to win promotion it would be nice if we could but were actually talking about building a football club from the bottom right from the very bottom
8741341 theres hardly any staff here in my opinion the club is rundown the facilities are awful
8741342 it needs tender care and attention it needs sorting out and the playing side needs sorting out but well get there
8741343 it will be difficult but you dont get anything out of life if you dont work hard and therell be plenty of hard work put in here
8741344 i am not having an assistant what would i do
8741345 my job will be out on the training pitch with the players everyday moulding them into a team hopefully
8741346 our manager paul trollope told me that oxford were interested when i came back off holiday and asked me whether i wanted to go
8741347 some other clubs were interested but i knew oxford was the club for me i like the set up here
8741348 i know quite a lot about the place i have spoken to a few oxford fans who live near me and they were urging me to come down here

8741352 ensuring that department of health and human services funds do not support coercive or discriminatory policies or practices in violation of federal law
8741353 the department of health and human services is recognizing the fact that it is indeed a form of discrimination for employers to expect if not demand that their employees compromise their consciences
8741354 clarify that non discrimination protections apply to institutional health care providers as well as to individual employees working for recipients of certain funds from hhs
8741355 require recipients of certain hhs funds to certify their compliance with laws protecting provider conscience rights
8741356 designate the hhs office for civil rights as the entity to receive complaints of discrimination addressed by the existing statutes and the proposed regulation and
8741357 charge hhs officials to work with any state or local government or entity that may be in violation of existing statutes and the proposed regulation to encourage voluntary steps to bring that government or entity into compliance with the law if despite the departments efforts compliance is not achieved hhs officials will consider all legal options including termination of funding and the return of funds paid out in violation of the nondiscrimination provisions
8741358 hurricane katrina was the costliest and one of the five deadliest hurricanes in the history of the united states
8741359 it formed over the bahamas on august 23 2005 and crossed southern florida as a moderate category 1 hurricane causing some deaths and flooding there before strengthening rapidly in the gulf of mexico and becoming one of the strongest hurricanes on record while at sea the storm weakened before making its second and third landfalls as a category 3 storm on the morning of august 29 in southeast louisiana and at the louisiana mississippi state line respectively
8741360 okay let me tell you what my concerns are number one you know the mayor has ordered the superdome to be used as a shelter of first resort i didnt hear about any other shelters as you may or may not know the superdome is about 12 feet below sea level so i dont know what the heck
8741361 im concerned about the roof i dont know whether the roof was designed to withstand a cat 5 hurricane
8741362 i do believe that i also heard there was no mandatory evacuations
8741363 taking prisoners out of prison they are leaving hotels open in downtown new orleans im very concerned about that
8741364 my gut tells me i told you guys my gut was that this is a bad one and big one i still feel that way today
8741365 look you cant do that because we in the field know what we need and what the priorities are brown and those priorities are established by the state and locals theyre not established by you
8741366 mike i know its tough but id like you to come back and fix it

8741390 during the meeting mr graells and mr courtovich also said
8741391 the suspension of operations is a result of the exceptionally difficult trading conditions which have affected all airlines over the last 12 months we have worked hard over the last seven years to build up a successful business but have incurred losses in the current year due to the unprecedented increase in the price of aviation fuel and the economic climate
8741392 i think it was inevitable that the industrys over capacity in seats would eventually take its toll
8741393 the run of airline bankruptcy is not going to end any time soon
8741394 this winter we are going to see more airlines going under with the ones with smaller fleets and weaker cash positions likely to be the most vulnerable

8741399 training is going well and all the lads are really going for it
8741400 they look hungry and determined for the coming season and thats a good sign
8741401 i know the club have turned down an offer from walsall and i am waiting to see what happens next
8741402 theyre a league one side and its the ambition of any player in the blue square premier to play as high as they can
8741403 i am concentrating on getting fit at the moment and we have some friendlies so well see what happens
8741404 jon went up to scotland last week to speak to a club im not quite sure who
8741405 were now waiting to hear whether he wants to move his family up there or whether he prefers to join us
8741406 jon is the type of striker were looking for but its out of our hands now
8741407 we havent made him a formal offer as such but hes got an idea of the deal we have in mind
8741408 i always thought the strongest likelihood was that jon would end up the league
8741409 the top strikers in the conference usually move up a level or two and jon scored an awful lot of goals for halifax last season
8741410 lee did a bit more than he hoped he would in the first week of training
8741411 it was always intended that he would do things at his own pace but without us pushing him hes joined in everything so far
8741412 when you found a relationship on getting paid it never goes farther than that and the moment the money runs out its over
8741413 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8741414 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8741415 i think thats taking some of the steam out of this rally
8741416 if people start canceling their vacations to the gulf because of the storm were probably going to have less demand for fuel than anticipated

8741426 el objetivo del profesional debe ser dedicarse a hacer un negocio de aquello que estudi o aprendi si trabaja ocho horas diarias tendr a que utilizar una cuarta parte de su tiempo a planificar c mo conseguir clientes otro 25 a promocionarse un 25 a vender y el 25 a ejercer la profesi n
8741427 para desarrollarse un profesional independiente necesita vender lo que sabe hacer
8741428 los profesionales independientes cuando salen de la universidad no tienen la menor idea de c mo conseguir clientes
8741429 en la facultad les contaron que ven a un cliente y les encargaba algo pero salen a la vida real y nunca vieron un cliente salvo un t o un primo o un amigo
8741430 llega un momento en la vida de los profesionales en que necesitan salir a buscar clientes y la mayor a no sabe c mo hacerlo en una empresa cualquiera se generan herramientas de promoci n y ventas y se publicitan los servicios pero eso no ocurre en el caso de los profesionales independientes
8741431 no tienen capacidad de riesgo de elegir de jugarse en serio porque los prejuicios los paralizan si se venden es porque est n desesperados si se publicitan en un medio caro son caros si van a uno barato son chantas dejan de hacer cosas por si no salen y tienen gran miedo al no
8741432 si no hay clientes no existe profesi n uno puede ser el mejor profesional del mundo y ni siquiera se entera lo primero es definir qu es lo que se va a salir a vender
8741433 cuando m s gen rico m s dif cil es de vender una cosa es vender un contador y otra un contador especialista en entonces es m s f cil definir nuestros posibles clientes c mo llegar a ellos etc
8741434 entonces si en cinco a os no quiero quedarme sin trabajo debo salir a buscarlo hoy
8741435 no hay que tener miedo a pedir referencias a los clientes amigos o familiares y hacer una base de datos llamar por tel fono ofrecerse hay que optimizar a todos los que ya se conocen y llegar a los que no se conocen si toco 100 puertas y se abren tres o cuatro es un xito

8741557 he makes our lineup better he can be a dangerous hitter but hes not here to carry this ballclub
8741558 but i dont think the adjustment period is ever really over thats just this game
8741559 im starting to feel more and more comfortable around these guys because im learning what their routines are
8741560 i dont want to interrupt anybodys routine but its been special to be in this clubhouse because its not owed to you you have to earn your respect
8741561 the last contending team i was on was in 1997
8741562 so to come here its really special to get an opportunity to be in something hopefully ill be holding up the trophy at the end
8741563 you cant let it define who you are but you also think about it every day
8741564 and this team yes they can get there so my thing is being able to win a championship thats something that just never materialized in cincinnati
8741565 i keep joking that when my son trey a high school freshman moves out and goes to college ill move in
8741566 these guys in the clubhouse they go out there and play hard they have a lot of fun and theyre great as people im not the guy that goes out there and chases every dollar its more important to me to be happy and be playing for something

8741575 named after lewis hamiltons formula one teammate heikki triumphed leaving his rivals trailing in his slime with a time of three minutes two seconds his owner 13 year old georgie brown from east winch norfolk saw him overcome over 200 garden snails battling it out over the 13 inch course in their quest to become world champion the annual event at congham near kings lynn in norfolk is over 30 years old and although there are a number of imitations it is the only recognised world championship
8741576 it s important for us to see what is out there
8741577 we want to make sure that our standards and practices are the leading edge practices and that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that the propane facilities are very safe to operate in ontario and that the public is safe
8741578 for the public to have confidence in the public safety system the mcguinty government should have been out front on this
8741579 but it s a government that doesn t like to take the blame so they re shirking their responsibilities and i m very disappointed in them
8741580 and i think we need to act on it sooner rather than later
8741581 everything is shut off with valves at the seafloor so if there s any damage to the facility itself the oil or natural gas whatever s being produced stays underground and doesn t get out into the environment
8741582 probably the main lesson we learned from katrina and rita is to take care of employees make sure they have a place to stay food generators and a place for their families
8741583 it s likely that we ll see a 10 cents per gallon increase in gasoline in texas and louisiana prior to the storm s arrival
8741584 we just don t know how we re going to get there you just have to pull out your credit card and hope you can pay at the end of the day
8741585 we deeply regret the fact that we have been forced to cease all zoom operations
8741586 it is a tragic day for our passengers and more than 600 staff
8741587 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
8741588 having been unable to complete the investment package the directors of zoom had no option but to instigate insolvency administration proceedings
8741589 these are things that we re going to work through and if we find passengers in difficult circumstances everybody s going to have to work together to deal with that
8741590 zoom was trying to get into a market that didn t exist really

8741594 i stood up and said im a democrat but im not a person of faith i said this looks like a church service to me and i never thought i would see the democrats doing something like this
8741595 im not a career protester i just dont like religion mixed with politics its wrong and its dangerous

8741603 imagine your retirement dinner what do your work colleagues from throughout the years say about you at this event
8741604 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8741605 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8741606 any of us from the progressive side of academia who runs into sean wilentz after that execrable smear job he wrote in

8741610 obama must beginning with his speech tonight immediately seize the initiative and begin to take control of the agenda the debate and the message of the entire campaign he must put mccain and the republicans on the defensive and keep them there unless that happens his chances of victory are slim
8741611 ive watched a lot of conventions ive always found them entertaining this year however this year the asshats just will not shut the fuck up

8741614 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
8741615 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
8741616 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long
8741617 james mirtle is battling off wing for the title of

8741620 curfew study hall and doing the right things in the classroom
8741621 hes mature he reminds me of a rockstar to be that young i marvel at how well he handles the pressure and how far hes come along in a short amount of time he really doesnt act like a freshman quarterback its been a great transition from high school to now hes taken it so well really taken control of it im proud of him
8741622 marve likes to get out of the pocket and scramble a little bit more jacory likes to stay in the pocket
8741623 if we throw them in for 60 plays and 30 plays they dont know what theyre doing then youll have problems
8741624 we have confidence because we prepared them for the situation
8741625 theyve gotten a lot of reps in scrimmages and what not so i think theyll go into the situation and be ready theyve gotten more work than most freshman have ever here so they wont be as brand new to things
8741626 allen bailey the other day went through the whole entire individual work out and tossed one of the offensive lineman doing drills
8741627 we just got to keep progressing both of them went to the doctor and the doctor said they looked good as long as the doctors say its ok they could play moncur was probably more ahead of bailey but both of them are about equal now
8741628 cook knows the defense like the back of his hand
8741629 when i came in as a freshman he knew the defense like the back of his hand and now he knows this one like that it gives you a lot of confidence when you got a guy in there when you know what to do it gives you a lot of confidence
8741630 the terminology has changed a lot and as we go through the season well pick up on a lot of things
8741631 basically what we have to do is erase everything from the last two years and start all over
8741632 hes graded out real well in all of our scrimmages and practices
8741633 its real surprising when you think hes only been here one year
8741634 i wouldnt compare him to rochford xavier is really athletic rochford was a guy who would beat you with speed xavier has a little more muscle on him he some speed on him too but he definitely can move people around
8741635 one minute you could be getting ready to punt then a first down comes and you might be in field goal range
8741636 things change pretty quickly coach has done a good job preparing us for it all
8741637 you can kick your leg out just like a pitcher throwing too many pitches you almost have to kind of be on a kick count
8741638 jake is a great long snapper and hes really going to do well with field goals im completely confident with him for all of us to get our timing down
8741639 the facades of its characters in each wrinkles of its inhabitants and in each chink of its buildings everyday life has been printed as well as longings and illusions of population and the town to build future

8741650 in britain and i think generally in europe jaywalking is absolutely the norm you cross when and
8741651 just shows us where we need to direct our disaster preparedness effort
8741652 the findings in this report will aid public health and emergency preparedness efforts and may help reduce the mortality burden in future natural disasters
8741653 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8741654 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8741655 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8741656 were glad to see were in the forecast path because they never get it right this far out
8741657 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8741658 this offer represents the best package of pay and benefits in the aerospace industry
8741659 so even a small disruption of a week or two can cause a slippage in the delivery schedule
8741660 i just think he doesnt have the temperament to be president
8741661 do i have the ability to speak with experience about someone who has abused everyone hes dealt with
8741662 there isnt a republican serving in the senate thats happy hes the nominee now theyre all supporting him but ill tell you they have told me ive had republican senators tell me they dont think theyll vote for him
8741663 e verything was there except for ein volk ein reich ein f hrer
8741664 well whats interesting about this is in the version that you saw on tv they didnt have microphones in the audience and when you actually hear what was going on in the audience you understand why congressman kucinich a democrat from ohio was getting so excited at the end of his speech heres what the speech sounded like when you actually hear the audience response
8741665 e verything was there except for ein volk ein reich ein f hrer
8741666 i mean this is pretty pretty amazing he kucinich has the same stature as a former orator
8741667 is reporting that sen john mccain has not made up his mind
8741668 thats the associated press dealing with what was a series of erroneous reports last night on a half a dozen different blogs and media outlets not fox news that suggested that mccain had made up his mind and had intended to tell his potential pick today
8741669 and speaking of senator mccain theres big news in his campaign tonight senator mccain has reportedly chosen his vice presidential running mate and that person will be notified tomorrow senator mccain is expected to announce his running mate friday morning in dayton ohio
8741670 mccain will inform his running mate of his decision tomorrow
8741671 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8741672 i hope it happens because it means that i at least caught a pass and contributed in some form or fashion
8741673 it means ive been surrounded by phenomenal teammates who have allowed me to get open and do my job its a neat little thing but if we win the game then ill be ecstatic its an absolutely critical game and at this stage of my career ive finally realized that wins are more important than individual statistics
8741674 it kind of hurt him that he missed most of camp and the first couple of games of the season with a leg injury
8741675 its no secret that hes not the fastest receiver on our team and we have guys that get open deep
8741676 his thing is to get open underneath but there are times were going to throw downfield there are plays designed for him the coaches know he can get open underneath
8741677 jarious has handled the week well and the last two days hes felt a lot better but i think we would be foolish to expose him unless there was no other choice
8741678 buck played quite a bit in the last two weeks
8741679 i believe hes ready to go what has occurred has been good for buck he has a lot of confidence and i think his shoulder is as good as its been
8741680 ive played against both of them and theyre both winners so it doesnt matter who were facing well have our hands full
8741681 theres no pressure on me ive been in this situation before said pierce adding that hes more concerned about getting the team back over 500
8741682 youre never satisfied with that kind of record were a better team than our record shows we have a lot of talent on both sides of the football were just not playing as one right now thats disappointing
8741683 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8741684 we cant continue to increase exports while their product is increasing at that level
8741685 something has got to give theyre our customers we want the market but things change over time
8741686 russian protein industries are not developed enough to support the countrys needs
8741687 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8741688 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8741689 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8741690 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8741691 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8741692 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8741693 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8741694 many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility

8741709 scheduled to be at the minnesota state fair planned to be there
8741710 does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have here is one big glitzy production that is focused on oratories and teleprompters without the underlying substance experience wisdom judgment accomplished track record and vision on issues for the future many americans answer to that is thats whats going on
8741711 i dont think anyone whos watching at home or online could miss the fact that there are two different paths that these candidates represent
8741712 bush if he didnt max out came awfully close to it
8741713 i certainly dont think we followed the path of 2004 where there was an absolute prohibition on mentioning george bush in the speeches
8741714 he had some mild chastisements in his speech and they were removed

8741731 i dont think haute couture will ever really die its like a beautiful song it will be there forever and it will never go out of fashion
8741732 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8741733 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8741734 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8741735 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8741736 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8741737 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8741738 i watched her all week she was being tortured every day
8741739 i think you dont know what goes on in combat until you are in combat
8741740 what i was trying to describe was a side effect of art and art as a kind of drug that numbs your senses

8741742 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system

8741750 i say that slightly tongue in cheek but its true
8741751 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8741752 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8741753 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8741755 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8741756 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8741757 its been a mountaintop experience to witness the revelations as the house gives up its secrets
8741758 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8741759 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8741760 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8741761 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8741762 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8741776 la legitimidad de estas operaciones residir en cada caso en las justificaciones o motivos que cada parte involucrada argumente a la hora de defenderlas o condenarlas en cualquier caso ser a absurdo pensar siquiera en el establecimiento de una instituci n o foro internacional con estos fines la esencia de una operaci n encubierta es precisamente sa su confidencialidad absoluta
8741777 una de las lecciones valiosas que aprendimos de los intercambios anteriores se refiere de forma especial al realizado en 2004 es que los medios complican la operaci n y crean circunstancias y condiciones previas porque el enemigo emprende siempre una guerra de credibilidad y no credibilidad en un intento de provocar fracturas en las posiciones de hizbul y esa es una pol tica que practic en muchas partes del mundo
8741778 hizbul es la punta de lanza de la resistencia frente a los que amenazan la libertad e integridad territorial del pa s

8741816 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site

8741828 en el momento de nuestro retiro del frente amplio deberemos expresar con claridad hacia la militancia frenteamplista y de izquierda toda nuestra posici n fundacional principista transformadora profunda popular antiolig rquica y antimperialista inmediatamente incluso antes deberemos consolidar m nimamente un accionar conjunto program tico no sectario y de masas en la medida de nuestras posibilidades operativas de igual modo deberemos al tiempo que denunciemos el apartamiento del gobierno de las propuestas program ticas y el alejamiento del frente amplio de sus postulados originales marcar con claridad nuestra estrategia signada por los intereses de los m s infelices

8741871 income poverty and health insurance coverage in the united states 2007
8741872 connecting the dots health and poverty americas shifting priorities 1960 2007
8741873 after falling with the stock market bust of 2001 the average income of the top 1 grew about 50 in real terms from 2002 to 2006
8741874 coming on top of the long term trend in rising inequality since the late 1970s this recent surge has resulted in the second highest level of income concentration on record going back to 1913 as the richest 1 of households held 23 of income in 2006
8741875 much of this growth comes from the ranks of the middle class
8741876 while low income people remain vulnerable middle income families have been hit hardest for adults with incomes above 200 percent of the federal poverty level about 40 000 per year for a family
8741877 his is the most embarrassing story never told even more embarrassing is that no one seems to care
8741878 health is influenced by five factors genetics social circumstances environmental exposures behavioral patterns and health care
8741879 when it comes to reducing early deaths medical care has a
8741880 the most consistent predictor of the likelihood of death in any given year is level of education persons ages 45 64 in the highest levels of education have death rates 2 5 times lower than those of persons in the poverty another strong influence has been estimated to account for 6 percent of income inequality takes a toll a 1999 study in the inequality the income differential between rich and poor is associated with something on the order of a 4 percent increase in deaths among persons on the low end
8741881 studies have linked poor health to the constant stress of a lower class existence a lack of control over ones life circumstances increased social isolation and the anxiety brought about by a subjective feeling of being of low social status all of which can be compounded by racism class the ignored determinant of the nations health
8741882 stress appears to trigger a neuroendocrinologic response that is beneficial in the short term but over the long run can weaken the bodys resistance to illness and other forms of mental illness are strongly linked to poor physical health as well as self destructive behavior such as excessive drinking and smoking at least 50 percent of the 2 million americans with severe mental illness abuse illicit drugs or alcohol compared to 15 percent of the general population according to the about smoking and mental illness are stark
8741883 are often dangerous high crime rates with substandard housing few or
8741884 schroeder observes this means that the residents no matter what their race income or education have energy dense foods cost less nutrient rich foods cost more quite simply high carb high fat foods are much more affordable than fresh fruit vegetables fish and other proteins and they tend to be even more expensive in grocery stores in poor neighborhoods where pricey items turn over slowly and may spoil before they sell source food choices and diet costs an economic analysis adam drewnowski ph d director nih roadmap center for obesity research professor of epidemiology and medcine school of public health and community medicine university of washington exercising outdoors can be dangerous and in inner cities public schools often lack playgrounds and gymnasiums
8741885 this pursuit is also evident in how we consistently outspend all other countries in the use of alternative medicines and cosmetic surgeries and in how frequently health cures and scares are featured in the popular media the result is that only when the middle class feels threatened by external menaces e g secondhand tobacco smoke bioterrorism and airplane exposure to multidrug resistant tuberculosis will it embrace public health measures in contrast our investment in improving population health whether judged on the basis of support for research insurance coverage or government sponsored sphere here than in most other developed countries which often have an active labor movement and robust labor parties
8741886 without a strong voice from americans of low socioeconomic status citizen health advocacy in the united states coalesces around particular illnesses such as breast cancer human immunodeficiency virus infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome hiv aids and autism these efforts are led by middle class advocates whose lives have been touched by the disease there have been a few successful public advocacy campaigns on issues of population health efforts to ban exposure to secondhand smoke or to curtail drunk driving but such efforts are relatively change
8741887 unless low income families have a political voice and use it to argue for more resources to improve health related behaviors reduce social disparities increase access to health care and reduce environmental threats social advocacy in the united states is also fragmented by our notions of race and class to the extent that poverty is viewed as an issue of racial injustice it ignores the many whites who are poor thereby reducing the care system is the second explanation
8741888 the american emphasis on the value of individual responsibility creates a reluctance to intervene in what are seen as personal behavioral choice
8741889 at some point we as a nation will have to decide whether we wish to design our health care system primarily to satisfy those who profit from it or to protect the health and welfare of all americans
8741890 anything is possible if the public begins to appreciate how little it gets for what it really pays
8741891 but a 2 trillion dollar plus disease care industry that has duped americans into believing they you must be dependent on them for good health is extremely hard to turn around
8741892 the standout recommendation would be that the present test is flawed and seen by some as intimidatory and needs substantial reform
8741893 can you believe this not even ten oclock and weve already run out of yacks bile
8741894 youre going to have all the resources this campaign has available thats the good news
8741895 the bad news youre going to have a whole helluva lot of me because im coming home
8741896 joe bidens effort to create a record out of thin air for barack obama will not be enough to make up for barack obamas lack of experience lack of judgment and plans to raise taxes on the hard working families of pennsylvania
8741897 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8741898 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8741899 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody

8741906 we might be through with the past but the past aint through with us
8741907 in the end i think we are trying to capture the history of the hotel and incorporate that into the development
8741908 we tried to mimic quite a bit from the hotel and bench the spa and conference center into the ground so youre still protecting the views out to the presidentials as well as the crawford ridge area
8741909 weve created a much more competitive and enticing golf course

8741922 i keep telling the churches in kenya you all believe in the same god you ought to come together god could never have wished that we fight amongst ourselves
8741923 we have a message to share if we dont present ourselves others will present a distorted picture
8741924 i want kenyans to know us as a community that will be a voice for freedom freedom to believe freedom to speak freedom to think freedom to share your faith

8741932 its always been my dream visitors come to my country and sometimes they come here they dont see anyone and theyre not learning anything
8741933 i think i could teach them my culture how to survive in kakadu and learn about bush tucker
8741934 one day i want to run my own business out here in kakadu as well my own tour guiding business
8741935 im going to have wine and dine dreaming tours thats what its going to be called
8741936 theres also a dysfunctionality in the relationship between our industry tourism industry and the aboriginal people who own kakadu to the extent that they were hardly involved in tourism at all
8741937 most of the product that develops will be about demonstrating to people that its a living cultural landscape if you like so all of the wonderful natural attractions interface with the aboriginal people whose culture is continuously interacting in manage those places
8741938 working with parks for quite a number of years i never saw hardly any indigenous guides
8741939 in just the last couple of years just seeing the different companies starting up its been really good and there needs to be more of it especially people from this country talking about their country and about their culture
8741940 for too long i think in kakadu theres been a lot of uranium royalties theres been a lot of sit down money right through the top end of the territory its been easy dough

8741947 i think were still at that point where jeff has some options we dont really know how bad it is were going to look at it and it will probably be through this weekend until it gets sorted out
8741948 just how much longer do you think environmentalists can strike deals that give up half of large wilderness ecosystems to industrial development for vague promises of protection simply more ecologically attuned folks know no more natural habitats can be lost and expect to survive climate change
8741949 the only meaningful forest protection is to work to keep all ancient primary forests standing and to meet needs for forest products from secondary forests regenerating into old growth there is no chance of achieving global ecological sustainability until ecological destruction ends what remains is fully protected and restoration begins
8741950 you cant present yourselves as cutting edge selfless and knowledgeable forest protestors and be routinely cutting deals to turn over millions of acres of ancient forests to fatcat loggers and minders
8741951 giving up on half of canadas boreal forests for a pocket full is mumbles is not the role of the rainforest action network members or donors they have no authority or expertise to be pursuing such deals

8742057 it isnt due to loss of habitat there is more woodland in the uk today than there has ever been and on the whole modern woodland management is more sympathetic to environmental concerns
8742058 the farm woodland scheme and farm woodland premium scheme have also encouraged the planting of small woodlands
8742059 traditional methods of management such as coppicing provide a perfect habitat for warblers and nightingales for instance
8742060 the coppicing process whereby the wood is regularly cut back creates open woodland with plenty of undergrowth for nesting where coppice is left to grow unchecked eventually the canopy closes and the undergrowth is shaded out
8742061 mature woodland with a closed canopy supports tree dwelling birds such as the woodpecker but offers a less diverse selection of species overall
8742062 many woodland species like the woodland edges and open areas where there is shrubby low level cover
8742063 an explosion in the number of deer in the uk has had a noticeable impact on just this sort of habitat through grazing at the herb and low shrub level it is quite likely that this is making a serious impact on woodland bird numbers

de bronz al ii clasa i n primii ase deci au punctat al ii clasa i n primii 10 sau 12 din lumea asta larg ceea ce este foarte mult i felicit rile le adresez n mod egal i celor care au c tigat i celor care nu au c tigat medalii pentru c dincolo de medalii a stat dorin a fiec ruia dintre dumneavoastr de a reprezenta rom nia c t mai bine celor care au c tigat medalii le am oferit i nalte ordine i medalii ale statului rom n i a tept i pe ceilal i la edi ia de la londra pentru a le oferi onoruri ale statului rom n am v zut cea mai mare parte a ncle t rii extraordinare n care a i fost to i m a impresionat efortul vostru m a impresionat d ruirea voastr dar poate aproape egal ca momentele de glorie m au impresionat momentele de ratare nu am s uit prima s ritur a lui dr gulescu niciodat i ratarea de dup numai un minut de fapt campionul olimpic moral la s rituri a fost dr gulescu cu 16 880 dac nu m n el cea mai mare not din concurs ceea ce ne arat c uneori un titlu olimpic depinde de o ne ans ntr o frac iune de secund m a impresionat camelia potec extraordinar m au impresionat mul i dintre dumneavoastr care nu a i c tigat medalii i din acest motiv am considerat c este corect ca to i s ne afl m ast zi aici s v mul umesc tuturor s v asigur de tot sprijinul meu i de respectul meu pentru ceea ce face i sigur cei care au venit cu medalii au luat i gloria pentru munca i performan a lor gloria la nivel planetar un campion olimpic este doar dat de rom nia dar el este un campion al lumii am v zut analizele de imediat de dup olimpiad toat lumea face compara ii cu edi iile anterioare sigur nu avem aceea i recolt de medalii ca la sydney sau la atena suntem totu i a 17 a ar din lume iar dac ne compar m ca dimensiuni ale rom niei locul ob inut de lotul olimpic este mult mult mai bun aceasta arat c sportul se afl totu i deasupra locului pe care ara l are n ierarhia m rimii ca popula ie i ca ntindere ca suprafa deci performan a dumneavoastr este una notabil de asemenea performan a de la locul 14 la atena cu aproape dublu de medalii i locul 17 acum mai arat un lucru concentrarea medaliilor pe cele trei mari na iuni care au concurat china statele unite federa ia rus china colect nd aproape 25 din medaliile acordate ceea ce este o explica ie pentru un num r mai mic de medalii dar fondul r m ne nevoia ca statul rom n s investeasc mai mult n sportivii lui m bucur c n zilele acestea vorbim de campioni olimpici fie c vorbim de judo pentru prima dat n istoria sportului rom nesc dob ndim o medalie olimpic la judo fete fie c vorbim de gimnastic de superbul sol fie c vorbim de canotaj altfel suntem obi nui i s vorbim de fotbal ne aducem aminte de marea performan de campionii olimpici numai atunci c nd le num r m medaliile n rest vedem fotbalul p n la suprasatura ie eu cred c acestor eroi ai lumii campionilor olimpici campionilor olimpici din rom nia li se cuvine mai mult aten ie i celor care sunt campioni olimpici n exerci iu i celor care au fost campioni olimpici i celor care se preg tesc s devin campioni olimpici lumea sportului nu nseamn doar fotbal de i trebuie s v spun c i mie mi plac toate sporturile i de asemenea fotbalul poate ar mai fi de spus c teva lucruri m a referi la tehnicieni i lor le mul umesc c au fost n spatele sportivilor fie c este vorba de antrenori de medici de maseuri de oameni care au asigurat sportivilor condi iile s realizeze marea performan precum la fel de bine ar fi poate s vorbim acum la cald imediat dup olimpiad despre nevoia re nfiin rii unui minister al tineretului i sportului sportul trebuie s fie reprezentat la masa guvernului i nu din c nd n c nd ntrebat ce se mai nt mpl i mai ales ntrebat cu dou trei s pt m ni nainte de marile evenimente ce performan e o s facem cred c sportul a nceput s defineasc for a na iunilor iar rom nia are nevoie s revin la un minister al tineretului i sportului ca institu ie care s reprezinte n edin ele de guvern interesele sportului i implicit ale performan ei rom ne ti n acest domeniu parc m uit cu un oarecare regret c avem campioni olimpici care sunt mai pu in sus inu i chiar de ara lor pentru a avea acces n comitetul olimpic n structuri care decid soarta olimpismului n rom nia i n lume cred c cei care r spund de olimpismul rom nesc ar trebui s aib ca principal grij promovarea fo tilor campioni olimpici rom ni n structurile olimpice interna ionale i na ionale mi a pl cut tare mult c nd l am v zut pe bubka celebrul s ritor fiind parte a comitetului olimpic interna ional premiind sportivi care se uitau la el ca la un idol al tinere ii lor sunt c teva g nduri dar g ndul care m ncearc cel mai puternic i pe care vreau s vi l transmit este respectul meu pentru fiecare membru al delega iei rom niei am convingerea c echipa de handbal feminin ar fi putut s fie pe podium doar accidentele i poate chestiuni care in de intimitatea echipei au f cut ca aceast echip str lucit din punct de vedere al valorilor individuale s nu se ntoarc cu o medalie de la beijing acela i lucru l a putea spune despre aproape to i dintre membrii delega iei rom niei de aceea v felicit pe to i v doresc n continuare succes sper ca baza de la izvorani s se constituie n acel laborator de mare performan laborator care v a lipsit n acest ciclu olimpic l a i avut doar c tre finalul ciclului olimpic vreau s cred c aceast baz cele c teva sute de s li de sport care vor permite sport de mas poate un program pentru bazine de not olimpice vor fi elemente care vor sprijini sportul rom nesc i nu numai nalta performan dar i s n tatea fiec ruia dintre tinerii din rom nia nc o dat v mul umesc mult v asigur de tot respectul meu i v asigur c dac voi fi solicitat voi fi un partener al dumneavoastr n discu ii i n g sirea solu iilor pentru noi performan e v mul umesc mult

8742178 yes the incident at tranent churchyard is well documented whilst not aware of the names of those highlanders involved there no doubt the muster roll of the 45 will in due course yield what you need to know mr grosset a commissioner for customs scouting for cope spotted that a detachment of the camerons had been sent by colonel osullivan one of the princes commanders to occupy the ravine below tranent churchyard and they opened fire on him he returned and reported to cope who instructed one of his officers colonel whiteford at 4pm on the afternoon of september 20th to advance two of the galloper guns 1 5 pounders and to open fire at 830 yards thereby disabling the camerons lord george murray the senior commander for the prince then ordered their immediate withdrawal at the request of cameron of lochiel and had an animated altercation with osullivan in the middle of tranent village shortly afterwards lochiel is remembered for remarking that nothing could so dishearten men than to be placed in an open exposed part where they could not advance one suspects your ancestor would be one of those in the disablement a church stands to this day but not the original there are two images of what it was like the one shown below noticeably with a spire and the other without both however include the same fine view across to preston preston pans and the field of battle it was re built in the early 19th century leaving the scene of the skirmish intact to this day and in september 2009 we are actually going to re enact the cameo of the tranent church yard with two galloper cannons and camerons however july 2009 will be a good time here so be sure to make sure you are with us in the pans your clan chief is by the way a member of our committee of high patronage and the camerons went on under lochiels leadership on september 21st 1745 to capture all twelve redcoat cannons and mortars tranent church is perhaps even better known for the fact that colonel gardiner the senior redcoat officer from bankton house in preston took refuge there in the manse and died on september 22nd in an upstairs bedroom nursed by a visiting from athelstaneford famous for the saltire ministers two daughters he is also buruied there although the location of his actual grave was lost at the time of rebulding

8742231 gsk is looking forward to working with valeant to provide important medicines like retigabine to the medical community and to the patients we serve
8742232 there is a significant need for novel anti epileptic drugs as almost one third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience seizures despite treatment with currently available medications we believe that retigabine could potentially play a significant role in improving the management of epilepsy and is a welcome addition to gsks portfolio
8742233 we were pleased with the significant interest shown in retigabine and we have selected gsk as a collaborator because we believe they are ideally suited and strongly committed to the continued development of this important compound
8742234 gsks development expertise and strong commercial infrastructure will be critical to maximising the worldwide potential of retigabine we believe this collaboration will strengthen our ability to bring this medicine to patients suffering from epilepsy and a variety of other conditions

8742246 this study adds to the growing body of clinical evidence about the cypher r stent in diabetics with coronary artery disease
8742247 these data are consistent with other recently reported clinical trial data that clearly indicate that the cypher r stent performs differently than the taxus r stent in diabetics which has been a topic of discussion and debate within the medical community for some time

8742311 no one is asking me to pack by bags for dayton
8742312 now its one thing if he has all the candidates on stage with as he announces the pick but to do it in a game show fashion is quite frankly demeaning and beneath the office he seeks
8742313 my friends you have all been waiting to find out who i will tap as my running mate and now i will show you my friends the next vice president of the united states
8742314 if you were president what would be the first thing you would do
8742315 you dont have to wait until youre president to do that you can come over to my house and mow pull weeds and sweep my yard and ill pay you 50 then ill take you over to the grocery store where the homeless guy hangs out and you can give him the 50 to use toward a new house
8742316 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
8742317 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
8742318 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
8742319 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
8742320 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
8742321 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
8742322 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

8742356 open source let us take the status quo of that industry and our own limited resources and innovate
8742357 we started in 2001 as three kids fresh out of college
8742358 we took what open source had and then gave back to the community our improvements
8742359 one of our key decisions as a startup was making our software available for free download payment on the honor system for a fully functional version of our product put us in the same predicament that was almost like following a shareware business model
8742360 what we were doing was unheard of in the security space
8742361 we give our resellers hefty margins we know what makes resellers tick based on our own reselling days we are the tool providers to their customers
8742362 even the small guys are growing astaros having multiple offices is a plus for them they are playing in a global market in terms of being in the american market he does need a presence in the u s
8742363 the initial risk was that open source would hold hichert back but he leveraged it to make it work for his needs
8742364 joining astaros partner program allows resellers to take advantage of a newly built field channel marketing team resources training as well as aggressive margins of up to 40 percent
8742365 more mid size businesses are relying on the internet mission critical security is more urgent for them a small business can fail because of that
8742366 astaro needs to meet channel driven competition the company has to make sure it has a strong base to move up from
8742367 from a balcony trotsky shouted to the delegates comrades offer no resistence we declare beforehand that only an agent provocateur or a policeman will fire a shot here

8742373 the mall is a quiet area and this would not be a quiet area
8742374 there would be noise there and a lot of hollering and shouting and thats different than the kids at the far end
8742375 on the other side of the park is a playground and a basketball court
8742376 and the studies that have been done on skate plazas have shown that they are not any louder than any other public facility like that
8742377 this is the same system we have in place today
8742378 the only difference is that we will now provide a limit by which a customer may be contacted
8742379 an extremely large amount of data much more than a typical residential customer uses on a monthly basis
8742380 as part of our pre existing policy we will continue to contact the top users of our high speed internet service and ask them to curb their usage
8742381 if a customer uses more than 250 gb and is one of the top users of our service he or she may be contacted by comcast to notify them of excessive use
8742382 at that time well tell them exactly how much data per month they had used we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8742383 though the proposed cap is relatively high it will increasingly ensnare more users as technology continues its natural progression
8742384 if comcast has oversold their network to the point of creating congestion problems then well disclosed caps for internet use are a better short term solution than comcasts current practice of illegally blocking internet traffic
8742385 the most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create to overcome to endure to transform to love and to be greater than our suffering
8742386 the double life that most cannabis users live has always been an interesting concept to me
8742387 because of the barrage of anti cannabis propaganda that has been spewed out over the years the worlds smokers have been forced into hiding doctors lawyers and teachers are so terrified that their habit will wreck their career that they often promulgate the anti cannabis line themselves im no different
8742388 the internet is teeming with film reviews and lists of favourite films but i wanted to do something different
8742389 its been a long slow process but i think some moves have been made over the past few years which seem to be steps along the right road i know theres a lot more to do but the pro cannabis lobby has been growing stronger and more determined and theyre not going to let this one die

8742408 this is not a question of whats true whats right whats wrong
8742409 the issue is those military judgments should not be second guessed
8742410 their hands were on that water pump and it should have been grounded
8742411 these contracts were meant to protect u s soldiers serving their country and we will not tolerate corruption that deprives the troops of the benefits of competitively sourced goods and services
8742412 we view illegal immigrants as one of many possible security threats to our installations and respond accordingly
8742413 it is critical to ices homeland security mission to know who enters sensitive areas like airports military bases and power plants to ensure the integrity of these key assets
8742414 in virginia we have been kind of the model for successfully prosecuting illegal immigrants
8742415 we are very aggressive when it comes to protecting the installation
8742416 we put that out clearly that fort lee will not be tolerating illegal immigrants working on post
8742417 it is a big deal from the standpoint that we have to stop work
8742418 unfortunately you have an individual who is hired to do work who is not aware of where the work is being done they dont know that identification will be checked
8742419 virginias construction industry is dependent on a large force of immigrants both documented and undocumented
8742420 the crime here is that congress has failed to pass comprehensive immigration reform
8742421 its sad its tough but unfortunately weve got a job to do we need to protect this installation
8742422 we realize that when you are breaking the law you are breaking the law and we are not at all going to play favorites to anyone
8742423 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8742424 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8742425 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8742426 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits

8742445 o governo usa o seu poder nefasto para fazer acordos se estamos aqui para defender interesses dos estados n o podemos obstruir a sess o porque deixar amos de levar benef cios para os diversos estados
8742446 o governo usa desse artif cio de esfor o concentrado para levar a sess o at uma hora duas da manh quando a oposi o vencida passa o rolo compressor do governo

8742529 the public will be angered that the home office is seeking to take serious powers that should be appropriately applied by the police and encouraging them to be given not just to local councils but also to private firms

8742562 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8742563 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8742564 our hope has been to prevent this case from becoming a major human rights matter over the issue of religious persecution
8742565 under international laws on the freedom of religion there is no question that bahais and others in yemen should be free to practice their faith while the situation is still unfolding we stand by the right of bahais in yemen and elsewhere to practice their religion in all aspects without the fear of being forced to leave their adopted country

8742610 de beers marine also required equipment that is reliable and ensures minimum downtime and is relatively easy to maintain for these reasons bosch rexroth equipment was specified by the client and is standardised across its fleet our design engineers developed the systems with simplicity accessibility and maintainability in mind
8742611 we provided the detail design manufacture installation and commissioning of the systems
8742612 the hydraulic design was completed locally with all the hydraulic pumps and valves imported from suppliers in europe the cylinders were manufactured in south africa by hytec engineering all the vessel systems were assembled and tested locally before being sent to the uk where they were fitted onto the vessel by the shipyard once complete the vessel returned to south africa and hytec commissioned all the hydraulic systems in cape town harbour the crawler hydraulic system was assembled and tested locally

8742614 service is absolutely crucial giving a quality product at a truly competitive price and meeting delivery schedules are the factors that result in growth i believe although there is always room for improvement we can claim to have a good track record in these matters witness the fact that some of clients have been with us for 12 years equally important of course is a readiness to be flexible and adaptable in meeting customers needs and there too i think we are slightly ahead of the pack

8742641 the new downtown area plan now under review was funded by the city council after a commission majority voted to recommend it buildings both apartments and condos could still be financed at six floors or fewer but the tall buildings seen as a way to fulfill some of the regional housing needs allocation imposed by regional government could only be bankrolled as for sale units not rentals the report said
8742642 were talking about million dollar condos planning commissioner gene poschman told fellow commissioners
8742643 homebuilders are always trying to sell their homes but these days they have an extra incentive beating the clock in a few weeks a financing option used by almost 20 percent of new home buyers to help scrape together a down payment is going away
8742644 its a loophole in the federal housing administration rules that let builders and other home sellers channel money through a charity to help homebuyers cover their down payment but lawmakers axed the programs effective oct 1 because almost 40 percent of fha borrowers who went into foreclosure since october had down payment assistance
8742645 were trying to let everyone know hey this is going away said brent urban a salesman for lennar corp referring to a sales promotion running for one of the builders developments in santa clarita
8742646 at lennars esperto community in santa clarita north of los angeles the incentives were tied to six finished row style townhomes priced in the mid 300 000 range buyers have to be able to close before sept 11 said urban
8742647 while many builders are continuing to lobby for the down payment assistance programs to be reinstated many have changed tactics and are promoting the temporary tax credit for first time homebuyers which was also part of the housing stimulus law passed last month
8742648 but the clock is also ticking on this deal the tax credit of up to 7 500 and expires in less than a year
8742649 some builders are exploring ways to give buyers some of their tax savings before they file their taxes if you can come up with some way to monetize it ahead of time it could help to offset the loss of that down payment assistance said nishu sood a deutsche bank analyst
8742650 ultimately however its going to remain difficult for a builder to fully overcome when a buyer simply doesnt have enough cash to make their down payment
8742651 you can offer lower rates you can offer further incentives sood said but if a homebuyer is going to have trouble coming up with a down payment thats difficult to offset
8742652 california new car dealers association statistics show that in the first two quarters of 2008 new car sales statewide slid 18 percent compared to last year the dmv data shows some napa county dealers have increased sales as much as 21 percent so far this year while others are down as much as 40 percent
8742653 business certainly has been challenging as it has been for all dealers this year said kevin massie owner of napa ford lincoln mercury citing the down housing market and shaky consumer confidence
8742654 we are seeing people that have challenged credit or foreclosures pending said bob kleis general manager of jimmy vasser chevrolet toyota
8742655 the mess in the home industry has trickled down into the car industry said napa nissan owner vince compagno
8742656 at napa ford massie said we have customers that want to get vehicles but are in the process of losing a home
8742657 there are 15 000 to 20 000 rental units in the city of ventura the california apartment association caa a statewide rental housing trade group that tracks things such as shifting rental costs and residential transiency determined at the end of the second quarter for 2008 a 94 1 percent occupancy rate throughout ventura county
8742658 that leaves a near 6 percent vacancy rate which explains some for rent signs that never seem to come down
8742659 the rental market in ventura county is relatively flat over the last year said caa deputy director eric wiegers
8742660 much like the price of oil can be correlated to record high fuel costs could there be a decisive factor that may cause rental costs to lower themselves in ventura there is when considering a shaky real estate situation
8742661 the only reason id suggest prices might come down is its tied to this whole foreclosure mess said wiegers
8742662 if youre looking for the bottom of the economic downturn you may find it here in the inland just that the when is another matter experts voiced some bleak near term outlooks wednesday at the third annual realshare inland empire conference at the ontario convention center
8742663 theres no nice way to spin it keynote speaker richard green director of the usc lusk center for real estate said of the local economy
8742664 there has never been until now a decline in the median home prices nationally since the great depression green pointed out the median income is falling and financial institutions are in an environment of fear he added
8742665 ppanels throughout the day included sessions on the capital markets and how investors are getting deals done in todays climate what it takes and costs to finance deals
8742666 in the past juana recinos sold up to 15 homes a year
8742667 calling the market a virus recinos said she doesnt think its going to get any better and doesnt expect to stay in the real estate business for long
8742668 recinos biggest fear is losing another potential buyer on the short sale home listed for 290 000 at 10127 vernon ave montclair the home was on the market in december for 450 000 recinos had a potential buyer within a month the bid was 350 000
8742669 but those people backed out last month because the lenders never called back she said
8742670 now someone is interested in the new price tag but once again recinos is left to play the waiting game im really beginning to feel they dont care because i keep on waiting and calling and then i get an excuse of sorry we lost the paperwork you have to resend it or we didnt receive it and im back to where i started she said
8742671 recinos said she and her husband have been cleaning up the vacant house in preparation for a foreclosure if the lenders dont call back in three weeks the home will be foreclosed on and recinos said she expects the price to drop by as much as 50 000
8742672 if the market continues to go in the direction it is the price will be lower than that she said
8742673 were talking about million dollar condos planning commissioner gene poschman told fellow commissioners
8742674 the mess in the home industry has trickled down into the car industry said napa nissan owner vince compagno
8742675 you can offer lower rates you can offer further incentives sood said but if a homebuyer is going to have trouble coming up with a down payment thats difficult to offset

8742684 and i feel really sorry for the guys contesting ryder cup places there is a lot riding on this week for them
8742685 its quite important to us because the championship is not looking good and we love getting the woolf whittaker memorial trophy for first new zealander

8742687 the last two years weve had issues but weve managed to place well
8742688 wed like a clean run and it would be interesting to see where we would actually finish if we did
8742689 i think if you take too many risks early on youre risking a lot because its a whole three days that you have to get through
8742690 its going to be a matter of treading reasonably lightly over the first day stepping it up a bit on the second and then if everything feels good going for it on the third its all about balancing risk and result
8742691 some of the wrc drivers have run on the tyre before whereas the locals havent

8742956 foster was probably our best player against ayr in the co operative insurance cup
8742957 we are not going to go through a whole season without injuries and the loss of form so jared will help us there
8742958 we have a couple of irons in the fire and we are waiting by the phone to hear from clubs down south
8742959 josh is now in the middlesbrough squad while sone is the same now that he has returned to birmingham

8742962 just great marvellous to be able to talk without having to gasp for a bit of air
8742963 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8742964 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself
8742965 patients come before money and we are currently in talks with the ministry about that
8742966 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8742967 those who choose not to go to australia will retain their place on the waiting list here
8742968 its not an isolated case as waiting lists at other dhbs are just as bad
8742969 shuster i have no idea what youre talking about have you been sleeping the past couple months do you never watch this show you usually sleep through this show because you didnt show up three times in a row somebody got into some bad acid at the protests and this conversation turned terribly wrong
8742970 you made that sound keith i can do the same to you thats what i thought and i said it
8742971 the situation at our channel is about to blow up
8742972 my reaction to that is grow up they have to just grow up
8742973 look i want honest authentic people on our air i dont want phonies so if the price of that is every once in a while one of these bubbles up im not concerned
8742974 this is our team theyve served us well we love em and were going to be at the republican convention and its going to be great and i dont have any hesitation
8742975 the drafting of the wording of those petitions has been nothing to do with me
8742976 a number of members with electorates adjacent to moreton bay recently met with the ministers staff to outline concerns raised by constituents
8742977 the ministers staff suggested that it might assist to make our case if we demonstrated public support through petitions
8742978 i assure you that this is a genuine process of demonstrating to the government that real concerns exist in the community about some aspects of the draft plan
8742979 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8742980 the gao which has long called for a single food agency last year bumped the current system up to the level of high risk area
8742981 the story is very pessimistic it has a dark and gloomy texture that japanese movie fans do not find appealing in a comic hero film japanese movie fans expect such films to be fun and action packed for the hero to be attractive for the villain to be loud and outrageous and for the movie itself to be easy to understand and light
8742982 ive had my shouting matches over 25 years privately in my office and in the offices of prime ministers
8742983 ive had disagreements israels a democracy and they make mistakes
8742984 se tom fosse lossigeno e bill la sostanza che reagisce verrebbe un tomossido di bill ma bill ha due valenze e quindi avremo un tomossido billoso per la valenza minore e un tomossido billico per la valenza maggiore
8742985 s e quindi ti aspetti che i tokio hotel saltino giu dallelicottero

8742990 a very nice gesture we wish more of his ads took that tone but its a very nice gesture
8742991 lets just say my foots got caught in the door
8742992 my focus is my training my focus is my next fight im not going to talk about retirement im not going to think about retirement i want to be 100 percent focused on the job ive got to take care of and well see after the fight how i feel
8742993 this fight will demonstrate to everyone that there is no sport universally as popular as boxing
8742994 i know everybody thinks this fight will be a difficult fight for me
8742995 i know some people say that its a very easy fight for oscar but i always do my job in the ring and ill do my best to give a good fight and to win this fight i think i can beat de la hoya in this bout i saw his last performance and i think im faster and stronger than him and im younger
8742996 a lot of people are going to be very surprised when were standing next to each other
8742997 size isnt going to be that much of a difference
8742998 i felt challenged especially from an expert trainer like that
8742999 he knows my style and he knows mannys and for him to say that was a big challenge
8743000 senator obama this is truly a good day for america too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8743001 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8743002 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8743003 senator obama congratulations on being our partys nominee to have an african american who is so well spoken representing us is historic
8743004 your message of hope and change resonate with all americans and not just you people
8743005 wow barry youre deadly in these elections where you game the system to get everyone else off the ballot arent you dont count on it working much longer dude
8743006 a very nice gesture we wish more of his ads took that tone but its a very nice gesture
8743007 ill call him a fucker because of the smirk on his face when he tries to come off as nice and instead looks like hes trying to audition for the part of bad guy no 1 in the next bond film
8743008 confidence in the bridge safety inspection process has been shaken
8743009 its really the only time in your life that youre supposed to gain weight
8743010 they say that youre eating for two but you have to remember that one of the two is only five ounces its not the same
8743011 it was brutal i would order my favorite things from restaurants and i would get it and say get that thing away from me grilled chicken or tomatoes would be the worst i would tell my husband to get it away from me
8743012 all i wanted was cheerios it was all i could eat for two months
8743013 i definitely have a sweet tooth with this pregnancy that i didnt have with my son with my son i craved savory things my doctor said to buy fruit at the farmers market i bought a cantaloupe and i had to stop myself from eating the whole thing i cut it up and put it in this big bowl and then next thing i knew half of it was gone
8743014 im addicted to that i definitely still do that while im pregnant
8743015 i try to make sure i dont do the same thing twice everyday is different and you can shake it up every day
8743016 free trade here will mean choice new zealand products will be served at the tables of the fascist junta of myanmar while we get cheap products produced by slave labour in myanmar destroying jobs in new zealand this is what labour and national regard as a win win situation under free trade
8743017 have the people of new zealand ever been told the full implications of free trade how it means essentially joining our economy and our destiny to nations under the grip of dictatorship placing labour conditions secure jobs and national sovereignty in jeopardy no just an ongoing propaganda campaign that unites the labour national party into one happy relationship with the worst thugs and crooks on the world stage
8743018 there is no place where it must end the trend of importing short term casualized workers between countries is increasing and how long will it be before employers are working with myanmar as a new source of cut price workers
8743019 if you disagree with the government in myanmar you get shot that must assist employment relations with the myanmar working class no end no negotiations no strikes and the ultimate flexible labour force it is indeed a model of how free trade and free markets can operate more successfully without democracy trade unions or basic humanity
8743020 they have an obligation to the international workers movement to represent the interests of the workers of myanmar to our labour government
8743021 while we make a huge noise about zimbabwe and the mugabe regime on the other hand we are moving further down the path of integrating our economy with dictatorships closer to home like myanmar the difference seems to be its ok when there is money in it for us the generals of myanmar will be laughing all the way to the bank
8743022 this must be what mr goff means when he talks about new zealand longer term strategic engagement with the asia pacific region
8743023 i started walking today i brushed my own teeth today sat up in a chair today fed myself today
8743024 anoles are highly visual species so in that sense its not surprising that they would use visual displays to mark territory
8743025 still the finding is surprising because these are the first animals known to use non acoustic signaling at dawn and dusk
8743026 as in humans if an anole can do many of these push ups it shows that he is in prime physical condition
8743027 these displays of strength help avert actual physical confrontations between male lizards which can be very fierce and destructive
8743028 these patterns have remarkable parallels with the dawn and dusk choruses reported for many acoustically communicating animals
8743029 these animals display a lot even when no other lizards seems to be around but in my experience theres probably another lizard over your shoulder somewhere that you dont see and thats who they are displaying at
8743030 hey buddy the element of surprise is gone im fit and i will escape if you try anything
8743031 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8743032 we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
8743033 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
8743034 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
8743035 is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frogs and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene
8743036 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
8743037 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
8743038 the population of this country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
8743039 mainly we are trying to understand the magnetic fields around the pulsar and the emission mechanisms that are making the pulsars pulse
8743040 the gamma rays we found are being produced by this cloud of high speed particles circling around the pulsar
8743041 yielding insights into the processes and mechanisms involved in making a dead star so active
8743042 the high degree and direction of polarization at high energies reported by dean et al provide valuable information on the site of acceleration of the particles and on the structure of the magnetic field associated with the pulsar
8743043 this is the brightest object in the gamma ray sky the one we have the most data for
8743044 the important thing we were trying to do in the first place is actually measure polarization because people havent been able to measure polarization to a good degree of accuracy before
8743045 these changes will affect any federal project that affects any endangered species
8743046 if these changes had come into place fema would have been able to make that decision
8743047 to ensure that decisions arent being made for political reasons
8743048 what were looking to do is remove some of the bureaucratic red tape on common sense projects
8743049 what this doesnt do is offer a federal agency a sort of get out of jail free card
8743050 they have an expertise that is unrivaled by any other agency
8743051 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8743052 particularly in the red sea one of the best investigated coral reef provinces
8743053 is a testimony as to how little we really know about marine biodiversity
8743054 dont go into your draft with a fixed plan because this strategy is sure to be destroyed the first time your competitor selects the player you covet you cant control who your competitors will select
8743055 for the majority of running backs yards gained last year are a better predictor of future touchdowns scored than touchdowns scored last year
8743056 i liken picking fantasy players to stock picking its an imperfect science
8743057 fantasy footballers that are consistently competitive year after year typically combine players who are consistent with players who are high risk high reward
8743058 so it wasnt that surprising to me to see atlanta falcons wide receiver roddy whites emergency last season playing with different quarterbacks
8743059 can really make a difference for a fantasy player especially if the qb is being switched to a new system
8743060 fantasy sports introduce the world of the real estate speculator and the stock trader to everybody its grounded in an activity that has common reference to everybody people can make their predictions they can see whether their predictions bear out and its a no cost environment for most people
8743061 were just trying to make sense of what kind of learning happens in fantasy league structure and the next question for us to consider is if we can identify the principles that govern fantasy leagues can we apply them to other contexts like congress or real estate or other markets that have mysterious working principles that if you could develop effective methods of prediction that you could learn a whole lot more about the systems than just by looking at them
8743062 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8743063 we cant continue to increase exports while their product is increasing at that level
8743064 something has got to give theyre our customers we want the market but things change over time
8743065 russian protein industries are not developed enough to support the countrys needs
8743066 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8743067 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8743068 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8743069 all bassinets produced and sold by sfca are produced in this manner with fabric permanently attached over the lower bar and meet or exceed astm standards and cpsc guidelines
8743070 today we are likely to be known as the old line or even the sideline churches instead of mainline
8743071 well you better start swimmin or youll sink like a stone for the times they are a changin
8743072 the space monkeys are human representations for me they are self portraits in a lot of ways and also portraits of humanity they are floating in nothingness i didnt want it to be a cartoon strip like a space monkey in a house then a space monkey in a car so i avoided all of that i didnt want to develop scenery like a house and trees once you put space monkeys in that kind of context it looses any kind of fine art quality to me
8743073 interactive and culturally relevant online community for the arts pop culture and action sports
8743074 when andy howell and i met up i actually got to see first hand this insane technology and the quality of the final printed deck and i was blown away it seriously was like looking at a giclee print on a skate deck
8743075 i will never simply throw an image on a board to sell it if it doesnt look good on a board i wont do it and all of the designs are the product of me finding the dopest looking way to present some of my favorite images
8743076 interactive and culturally relevant online community for the arts pop culture and action sports
8743077 the review will include consideration of hupds diversity training community outreach and recruitment efforts as well as the ways in which harvards past experience as well as best practices elsewhere can help inform our future practice
8743078 it was later established that the person was working on the harvard campus for the summer owned the bicycle and was trying to cut the lock because the key had broken off in that lock

8743081 it is best to aim a bit forward of the flys starting position to anticipate where it is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8743082 we were surprised to find that long in fly time before a fly takes off in response to a predator or swatter it plans the direction of the jump by making a rather complex series of postural movements
8743083 these movements are made very rapidly within about 200 milliseconds but within that time the animal determines where the threat is coming from and activates an appropriate set of movements to position its legs and wings
8743084 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8743085 our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct pre flight posture
8743086 this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper pre flight pose
8743087 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8743088 we are not seeing the middle classes move away from drink the middle consumer group is under pressure but what were seeing there is a migration from the on premise pubs and bars to the off premise for the average person of 35 with a young family and household income of less than 40 000 a year a night out at the pub these days is expensive we have to capture that off premise occasion
8743089 i dont wish to be immodest but were pretty good at it
8743090 to use an untried computerised ticketing system was a mistake and warnings had been given people have to be able to buy tickets and performers have to be paid decisions were made that were found to be wanting
8743091 the fringe has been healthier but anyone predicting its demise is wide of the mark the credit crunch the olympics and bad weather have all played their part in bringing sales down but we enjoy a huge success every year i am certain the festival will overcome this years setbacks the next director will inherit an healthy organisation
8743092 our theatre group had massive critical success and of course we didnt get the audiences to match every ticket is precious and the failure by the box office meant companies were denied very valuable ticket sales
8743093 the fringe society were secretive about everything there was a real lack of transparency about what we heard on the outside and what was happening on the inside
8743094 the board is very grateful to jon for his significant contribution to the fringe in the short time he has been in post he has dealt with an unprecedented range of challenges we are pleased that jon is willing to assist with the independent review of the box office
8743095 mccain doesnt like to be forced into a decision the fewer people banging on him with advice on something like this the better as far as hes concerned
8743096 the race is too close theres no need to do something like that mccain doesnt need to throw a hail mary here
8743097 all i can tell you is this if lieberman is picked the dome of the convention hall will blow off there will be a mushroom cloud
8743098 if she said all the right things on parental notification partial birth abortion judicial appointments it would be difficult but we could survive it
8743099 its a psychological thing to make the sort of special donations that we will need people need to know that theres no one else to whom you can appeal
8743100 scottish ministers are determined to do everything they can to ensure that this world class collection remains on view for the enjoyment of the public in this country the national galleries of scotland has been given a significant funding pledge from scottish ministers around which to build its fundraising campaign a precise figure will be confirmed in due course
8743101 i think they will keep them but it will be a lot of hard work
8743102 this is beautiful art and this is a great museum the government should help to pay for the paintings
8743103 its a different argument than health or education its about something thats good for all of us as a society we need more than a payslip great art is good for your head
8743104 life some of it is wonderful and some of its miserable and most of it is somewhere in between
8743105 the hardest thing in this world is to live in it
8743106 i used to think it was a terrible thing that life was so unfair then i thought what if life were fair and all of the terrible things that happen to us came because we really deserved them now i take great comfort in the general unfairness and hostility of the universe
8743107 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
8743108 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8743109 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect barack obama
8743110 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us
8743111 more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans that will swell the deficit increase inequality and weaken the economy more band aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured more going it alone in the world instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence
8743112 will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope
8743113 and so if you like me believe that america must always be a place called hope then join hillary and chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8743114 this looks very serious it is windy rainy trees are also falling down and we have no electricity
8743115 we made a real effort to find out and they were entirely uncommunicative
8743116 i came away with a very clear impression that something is going to happen that doing nothing is not a choice here
8743117 weve been telling them to think very carefully before acting and move very cautiously and whatever you do make sure that its multilateral not unilateral
8743118 it is pretty evident that the european government and our own government are weighing options right now
8743119 the situation is clearly at a serious level and theyre trying to find the right way to respond to this
8743120 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8743121 there are examples where health inequalities have narrowed but in too many cases we have seen a widening but that means the magnitude of inequalities is flexible if the gap can widen it can get narrower
8743122 the key message of our report is that the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age are the fundamental drivers of health and health inequity
8743123 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8743124 the uk is at the forefront of tackling health inequalities but the challenge of reducing the gap in life expectancy is still very much an issue
8743125 not in my lifetime but it happened i guess i lived too long
8743126 they assigned me to walk through the mall with him all the way to the lincoln memorial
8743127 i miscalculated the whole thing ive said many times to my boy and my friends ill never see the day when a black man would get that far
8743128 ive seen lynchings ive seen beatings ive seen sharecropper fraud and cheating and beating and i just never thought wed get to this place and time
8743129 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8743130 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8743131 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8743132 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8743133 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8743134 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8743135 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression
8743136 these are horrifying statistics the truth is that these could be avoidable deaths
8743137 the reasons for these deaths are simple it is down to dirty hospitals overcrowded wards lack of isolation units and poor practice
8743138 cases of mrsa and c difficile infections are falling and for the first time we are seeing the number of recorded deaths from mrsa falling too however people who are very ill are vulnerable to infections not all of which are avoidable
8743139 it is tragic that so many people are dying unnecessarily each year from
8743140 the vast majority of these deaths could have been avoided if the government had only taken the right action
8743141 we need better antibiotic prescribing and hygiene but also proper isolation facilities in hospitals to stop infections spreading but labour have broken their promises on this and three quarters of hospitals still lack proper isolation facilities
8743142 tennistiquement ce n tait pas tr s bon a conc d la fran aise je fais avec ce que jai en terme de motivation parce que jai un gros mois derri re moi et beaucoup de matches dans les pattes
8743143 jaccuse un peu le coup mon corps est las a t elle ajout il va falloir que je g re bien mon jour de repos parce que contre de plus gros adversaires jai peur de l cher physiquement cest comme si javais une p e de damocl s sur la t te

8743145 cest une victoire qui fait beaucoup de bien a r agi la fran aise de 29 ans ancienne quart de finaliste tournoi mais je vais quand m me bien savourer cette victoire cela fait longtemps que je navais pas battu une fille de ce niveau l en grand chelem
8743146 cela fait un an et demi que je gal re un peu alors que je travaille aujourdhui jen r colte les fruits tout a cest du pass maintenant
8743147 it was a tricky match and i knew it was going to be tough but i am glad i came through
8743148 i think everyone feels a bit of pressure in those tense moments i think he served well on those big points but he did miss an easy shot and i managed to get a few returns back
8743149 however c d c and state health departments are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strain
8743150 possibly were a vehicle for infection particularly early in the outbreak
8743151 these findings indicate that additional measures are needed to enhance food safety and reduce illnesses from produce that is consumed raw
8743152 we need to develop technologies which will enable us to detect pathogens in fresh produce more quickly
8743153 the point is that not all industry is doing it and there need to be standards
8743154 the jury found that at some point the dolls infringed but the question is was it the earlier dolls or the later dolls or all of them
8743155 without a special verdict form its difficult to see how an injunction would be styled
8743156 the main bratz brand will always remain with mga and we are going full blast forward and nothing will stop us
8743157 the jury made a determination about damages but it didnt make a determination about the connection between the drawings and the damages
8743158 the stakes still remain very very high for mga theyre not out of the woods yet at all
8743159 the real prize is going to be can mattel convince the judge to grant an injunction that would prevent mga from ever producing another bratz product
8743160 for a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife

8743165 we can relax now but please be cautious they might return soon
8743166 the behaviour of our travelling fans has been exemplary in the past
8743167 we played manchester united two seasons ago in the champions league and there were no problems
8743168 we dont envisage any problems this time either the two clubs have a great relationship
8743169 the events at the uefa cup final were unprecedented particularly in relation to the number of fans who came to the city
8743170 on this occasion we are talking about a normal champions league game and we would expect it to pass off peacefully celtic have been here on a number of occasions and we do not anticipate any problems
8743171 one membership provides access to seven premium paysites and multiple video and photographic updates daily

8743182 it might be true that the market is contracting for us but we have to prepare for future growth

8743188 this is a momentous decision and legal victory for women and families in mexico
8743189 in a region where abortion is highly restricted the supreme court has taken a huge leap forward in protecting womens basic human rights todays ruling opens the door for women across the country to demand that their local governments follow mexico citys example
8743190 the ministers that voted against his proposal say there is no place explicitly in the mexican constitution or in international law that says life should be protected from the moment of conception
8743191 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8743192 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior
8743193 gave legality to these pseudo doctors to open their clinics and continue operating as they are doing and now theyre no longer doing it in secret theyre doing it openly
8743194 failure to follow the contract language weakens oversight of the contract and erodes city council control over city finances
8743195 this is an important victory for people with vision loss

8743241 a california copyright infringement case brought by an adult video maker against a video sharing web site veoh networks has been
8743242 it is great to see the court confirm that the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8743243 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online
8743244 even if the veoh decision were to be considered by other courts that case does nothing to change the fact that youtube is a business built on infringement that has failed to take reasonable measures to respect the rights of creators and content owners

8743256 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8743257 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8743263 sure but you keep your fscking mouth shut when we do this
8743264 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8743265 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8743266 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8743267 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8743268 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8743271 i bought a humidifier and a dehumidifier and put them together in a room to fight it out
8743272 lisa in this house we obey the laws of thermodynamics
8743273 its way too early to say anything about charges but i think we need to take a look at the same things the school board is apparently looking at whether policies and procedures were followed and whether those were added to protect the young fellows who were playing football
8743274 i can see the slope really embracing what we want to offer
8743275 im developing a weekend rock band school in a rehearsal space on st marks would anyone be interested
8743276 its important for kids to have some sort of musical background and coming from someone who didnt pursue it i really want my son to
8743277 the idea is to work mainly with beginners as well as kids who have some knowledge on their instrument and want to diversify their abilities
8743278 the program is not geared for teenagers who can already play like guitar legend jimmy page
8743279 from the get go i was amazed at the ability of these kids to pick up this music so quickly and be so excited about it
8743280 by the end of the year we had kids writing their own lyrics
8743281 from a parent point of view the one time he took the kids to the studio he did a great job
8743282 everything worked out well and the kids had a great time
8743283 the kids were always excited about what they were doing
8743284 i think a school of rock is something that brandon would be more interested in than taking some kind of clarinet or flute or violin
8743285 its a way to express himself instead of having to interpret other peoples expressions in music
8743286 i think this is something that would keep his interest
8743287 dad arrested for kidnapping daughter to stop marriage to non muslim
8743288 we cannot eliminate this practice but we can and will work to a code of practice so that the children dont get hurt the law isnt broken and the people who do want to take part dont get prosecuted
8743289 we have to take into account peoples beliefs and their rights and we will respect them
8743290 but we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance weve got to prevent any harm being brought against any children
8743291 swung it once or twice and said i dont want to do it anymore
8743292 it was an emotional time and the children were happy they asked for it no one forced anyone
8743293 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8743294 was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of shia muslims
8743295 indeed the prosecution relied as part of its evidence upon the president of the local shia community centre
8743296 we are satisfied that given the age of the children involved the coercion employed by syed mustafa zaidi who did not accept that he was wrong and the possibility of such an incident occurring again the decision to prosecute by the crown prosecution service was the correct one
8743297 this is a very unusual case and the first of its kind to be prosecuted by the cps in england and wales
8743298 in humans this mostly causes a short term flu like illness in fact most people dont even know theyre infected

8743305 growing up in florida everything was so clean so absurdly clean
8743306 living in this area with many abandoned buildings and new ones being built its inspiring as were working a lot with grids right now and theyre burnt and melted and it works with decomposing architectural type pieces its kind of natural and organic in a way and theres a duality with the architecture and the man made aspects
8743307 our jewelry has always started off as very conceptual almost art project y so we wanted to combine those ideas with wearable jewelry
8743308 we were always pushed in school to do sculpture most people didnt make jewelry we didnt want to sell out but we still wanted to do it so we maintain the integrity behind metal smithing by making everything ourselves not sending it out to china to be mass produced
8743309 you know how you go to the beach in search of a bottle you cant go there without seeing one theres hundreds of them all washed up and peeking out from the sand

8743325 ibm has demonstrated for the first time the game changing impact solid state technologies can have on how businesses and individuals manage and access information
8743326 performance improvements of this magnitude can have profound implications for business allowing two to three times the work to complete in a given timeframe for classic workloads
8743327 we recognize that assignment is an option that individuals may wish to exercise it is in no way pushed upon kde contributors
8743328 there are also other avenues of copyright assignment available besides the fla but we believe this is the easiest way to get it done with little fuss
8743329 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community the fla was designed to help projects increase the legal maintainability of their software to ensure long term protection and reliability kde is among the most important free software initiatives and it is playing a central role in bringing freedom to the desktop
8743330 the fla is a versatile document designed to work across different countries with different perceptions of copyright and authorship
8743331 as a truly international project kde provides a great example of how the fla can provide legal coherency in the mid to long term
8743332 it looks like the whole kde community users and developers is a perfect match to start porting service oriented computing to the masses there is an incredible need for integration communication sharing and service accessibility
8743333 we are very open to anyone who would want to join us as an investor
8743334 india has become our second largest market after the u s and continues to grow rapidly
8743335 our sales to india have more than doubled in the past few years to the level of 50 million to 100 million
8743336 i cant afford to have a baby right now because my job is not stable we live with zorans parents because we dont have enough money to rent or to buy an apartment were going to wait a year or two just to see if the government is serious this time and after the money is guaranteed we can think about having babies
8743337 we spend around 250 euros a month for all the basic needs of my children like kindergarten food and clothes but as they grow up we need more money my mother helps me a lot for instance she buys books and all the necessary things for school for my son thats why i have to work in shifts and to do extra jobs
8743338 the government should provide free kindergarten free school books and give financial aid for university students also mothers must have free weekends and have a right to go home earlier than other employees what if the government fails with this project i cant stay at home and wait for help from the state
8743339 so my perception of technorati now as a blog search tool is that it isnt reliable any longer although to be fair i did a search just now which did work
8743340 what does it mean when i search on technorati for

8743349 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8743350 we commend the u s department of justice criminal divisions computer crime and intellectual property section the u s attorneys offices for the western district of north carolina and the eastern district of virginia and the federal bureau of investigation for their work in bringing these criminals to justice
8743351 these decisions illustrate once again that game piracy will not be tolerated and the extent at which these criminals will be prosecuted the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry
8743352 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8743353 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8743354 i got me a chrysler it seats about 20 so hurry up and bring your jukebox money
8743355 weve been off to a good start there have been a lot of administration questions during these first months but now were getting ready to get a lot of real work done
8743356 norway is in line with the european trend toward local product while hollywood loses ground
8743357 there is a strong clear will to concentrate on making films
8743358 we used to make seven to eight features per year now we are up to 20 25 thats pretty good for a small country previously private investments in norwegian films were only 10 now the pendulum is swinging the other way distributors take bigger risks and invest more the increased production shows that we are on the right track
8743359 im positive even though its too early to say too much about the new institute one bad thing is that right now there is only one feature consultant we are waiting for another one to be appointed which we have been promised will happen shortly several projects are waiting for that person
8743360 we sell a lot of tickets the business answers by making more and more films and there is everything from small arthouse films to blockbusters like the epic max manus which will open at christmas
8743361 you cant be scared to fail its better to make a film that fails than to be scared and not try im not concerned about the commercial films but we have to send strong signals of support to the art movies
8743362 of course there are a lot of rules and a lot of red tape we are an arm of the state and this means a lot of administration
8743363 but our goal is that we all should be reachable that every filmmaker that contacts us should get a prompt answer
8743364 many of us left the school with working units already formed and we have continued to work together
8743365 i think the production support is very generous maybe its a little bit more formalized than in sweden overall there is a lot of enthusiasm and pride and there are a lot of interesting new films coming this season
8743366 i am very grateful for this opportunity and i understand my responsibilities to the dallas cowboys and the national football league right now i just want to keep working hard so i can accomplish the goals that i have set for myself both on and off the field
8743367 theres no sure thing in life its nice to finally get the affirmation for all the hard work hes put in
8743368 the rest is up to him its time to play football hes a very motivated player
8743369 he has a good head on his shoulders he should be fine
8743370 adam has worked hard to get to this point but he also knows that there is still a lot of work ahead of him
8743371 he is fully aware of the opportunity that he has been given and he knows that this is an ongoing process
8743372 i think from the beginning there were a lot of critics saying that this couldnt be done that he couldnt turn his life around
8743373 im very happy for adam hes proven everyone wrong hes got a very bright personal and professional future
8743374 being human it changed him a lot it was a very difficult process to go through

8743376 while pfizer is combining two innovations here convergence and capped fees well uk law departments wouldnt call law firm panels exactly innovative it missed an opportunity to add a third when it retained the right to recoup jackson lewiss unspent fees at the end of the year
8743377 hes running against the war running against washington in the primary he positioned himself against the clinton years but thats not what the general election is about the general election will be about changing washington not changing the democratic party
8743378 i think this is going to be a centrist democratic administration its going to be an administration that will end up governing from the center on a range of issues
8743379 im happy with his policy i think barack obama tends to be a moderate hes a moderate by his instinct hes a bring people together
8743380 obamas message has been one of unity inclusiveness and coming together there have been plenty of efforts to throw him off course but hes sticking to it
8743381 politically speaking i think obama would like to have the party in a place that is very close to where clinton had the party
8743382 yet i do believe that after the experiences with bush and the war that the people that make up the majority of the democratic party are a little to the left of center
8743383 i think its found its way back to a progressive center
8743384 part of the fight weve been part of the last eight years is trying to get a party that after 9 11 was very timid to stand up and fight you see more new leaders who are confident and willing to be bold
8743385 i think obama brings two new things to the table and theyre not entirely unrelated
8743386 the first is a promise of a generational transition and hes been absolutely frank and explicit about this from the beginning the second is a somewhat less polarized style of politics in washington
8743387 that rewrites who the electorate is in a very important way
8743388 it would suit me just fine if obama gets assinated and clinton gets to be the nominee i hate obama
8743389 anchorage has no more effect on climate change or polar ice than does an emission in ankara

8743403 this teacher is a space cadet totally high up on herself towards men assignments were overwhelming lectures were boring as hell threated to fail me if i didnt withdraw paper assignments were vauge and confusing this teacher should resign
8743404 very hard to understand very unclear with her expectations of students she will pick on students who dont appear to be paying attention and then make her best attempt to embarass them for not being prepared last time i checked we were paying her to teach us not embarass us if we choose not to pay attention thats our choice

8743415 rumours of the death of the australian economy are overdone
8743416 commsec still expects the reserve bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week however the latest result will clearly water down the more optimistic market views of rate cuts in coming months
8743417 twenty five basis points looks a done deal next week but further rate cuts from there have just become a whole lot less certain

8743436 weve got them all to get back in and weve got a great chance at the next stage
8743437 but we are through and that is the main thing
8743438 it was a tricky game we are pleased to be through but with the squad we have we should look to go quite far in this competition
8743439 everyone wants to win a trophy and we think we can go quite far
8743440 we did really well out there but i was hoping we would be ready for the game
8743441 the problem comes from permanent damage to the rigs in the gulf the refineries and other facilities on the coast even if they released the spr if those things are damaged from a storm theres going to be a supply disruption
8743442 i think theres a lot of talent out there that hasnt taken the field for an a league team yet
8743443 the premier leagues in each of the states have a lot of players who are capable of playing at the a league level but because of the small number of teams probably havent got their opportunity yet
8743444 queensland has the second most registered football participants we think theres a very strong interest in football but more importantly theres a strong interest in following sport
8743445 i think we can win the league obviously thats going to be up to miron to pull a rabbit out of the hat
8743446 at the end of the day you are in here to win but we are here not only to win but to create a special environment for the people who are on the coast and in northern nsw
8743447 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8743448 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8743449 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8743450 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion
8743451 it is time to establish the truth about the crimes committed before and during russias invasion of georgia
8743452 georgia continues the redeployment of its forces in the direction of south ossetia and the restoration of the combat capability of its troops
8743453 this is a very serious crime incident which is very traumatic for victims and also very time consuming for our local police to investigate
8743454 i often ask myself what causes a person so young to commit such serious crimes
8743455 is it the non existence of good parenting for the child lack of values lack of respect for another person or a societal problem in that we have not provided adequate support for the greater family regarding their needs

8743463 students with a strong jewish identity should consider enrolling elsewhere unless and until tangible changes are made
8743464 t he chancellor has failed to exercise his moral authority as an educator and leader by abrogating his leadership responsibilities the boundaries of rational and reasonable discourse by constituencies that have differing positions on emotional issues have not been established
8743465 we looked at the task force as a way to bring the community together
8743466 the situation for jewish students is untenable because of the hatred
8743467 in a volume not seen 15 or 20 years ago
8743468 whether this is a temporary aberration or an indication of halting progress can only be revealed with further study and action
8743469 for years we had been involved in promoting muslim jewish dialogue on campus but it wasnt enough to just talk about issues together we wanted to develop curricula that would seriously address and educate students about cultural religious and political issues that were the basis for conflict on campus
8743470 i went to the academic affairs office of the department of homeland security and said i know you are protecting bridges but were building bridges we needed to go deeper and have a greater impact on campus culture we wanted to take students off site so that they could develop personal connections and relationships that would build trust
8743471 while we are now assessing the data our impression is that these dialogue projects are contributing to a distinct lowering in the level of campus conflict over political cultural and religious issues
8743472 when you dont know people from other cultures its easy to vilify them when you develop personal relationships and connections you feel obligated to act in a more civil manner on campus and consider how programs speakers and articles in the newspaper will affect other students
8743473 its not that everyone agrees far from it but when the president of hillel and the president of the arab student association ended up living in the same building they were much more likely to talk through differences and do joint programming to discuss difficult issues than to fight propaganda battles in the campus media
8743474 when students feel that fellow students from other religious communities are willing to listen to them even when they disagree this lessens the level of tension on campus
8743475 the vicissitudes of tolerance jewish faculty and students at clark university
8743476 in 1925 harvard universitys appointment office sent a typed memo to clark with a list of five available candidates with masters degrees in mathematics the chairperson of harvards mathematics department initialed the document which he labeled confidential and wrote comments at the bottom of the page about two of the candidates about one masters student he wrote jewish not very clean cut personally and about the other lame not very clean cut personally as i remember him only these two candidates had x marks written over their names it is unclear whether the chair from harvard or someone from clark made these marks
8743477 when atwood tried to convince the board of trustees to approve a two year appointment for a refugee scholar in 1941 he pointed out that the applicant is a belgian not jewish
8743478 one year earlier a department chairperson believed that atwood opposed his first choice for a one year position because the candidate had the misfortune to be an armenian and to look like a jew which he is not the department head thought it might help his candidates chances if the president knew that this armenian scholar had a white anglo saxon wife who was an attractive intelligent girl in the end atwood agreed to this temporary appointment
8743479 discriminatory practices against jewish faculty and students reflected a xenophobia that plagued the united states during the post wwi era
8743480 henry fords publication of the anti semitic protocols of the elders of zion a tract accusing jews of waging an international conspiracy for world domination contributed to a political climate that influenced congress to pass its 1924 legislation curtailing immigration of racially inferior people including east european jews
8743481 many east coast college presidents implemented exclusionary measures out of fear that increasing numbers of jewish students would overwhelm their schools and threaten an institutions reputation pres a lawrence lowell of harvard advocated a quota system when the proportion of jewish students at his school tripled from 7 percent in 1900 to 21 5 percent in 1922
8743482 similarly yales pres james rowland angell supported his deans recommendation to limit the number of jewish students when they grew from 2 percent in 1901 1902 to more than 13 percent of the class of 1925
8743483 once one school introduced quotas a chain reaction emerged since none wanted to become a dumping ground for unwanted jews
8743484 as a result of these strategies the proportion of jewish students in yales class of 1934 decreased to 8 2 percent while the proportion in harvards class of 1930 fell to approximately 10 16 percent meanwhile princeton cut its number of successful jewish candidates by almost half ensuring that the jewish proportion of the student body would not exceed 3 percent the percentage of jews in the national population
8743485 a strengthening of democratic values the dismantling of the jim crow system of legal segregation and an overall decline in anti semitic sentiment led to the decline of jewish student quotas and to a dramatic increase in the number of jewish faculty
8743486 by the time of the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 legislation that guaranteed that all persons shall be entitled to the goods services facilities privileges advantages and accommodations of any place of public accommodation without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race color religion or national origin anti semitic quotas had all but disappeared in the academic world
8743487 knock a jew in the oven three throws for one dollar
8743488 the situation is better now on campus than it used to be
8743489 during the first and second intifada the level of anti israel activity such as movements for the university to divest from israel was more pronounced we countered at that time with a major campaign invest in israel to educate the campus
8743490 recently with programs like iact inspired active committed transformed in conjunction with bostons combined jewish philanthropies we have doubled the number of students we have sent to israel last year alone we sent more than 200 students to israel from tufts and then did serious follow up work with these students after they returned
8743491 one of the greatest strengths of israel is that it is a vibrant democracy the only vibrant democracy in the middle east as long as students support the right of israel to exist we have no problem with students who are critical of specific aspects of israel policy
8743492 the real challenge is to educate students to be passionate knowledgeable advocates and supporters of israel even if they dont accept every aspect of current policy we do this through travel to israel first rate lectures and introductory programs like israel 101 which is a peer led student program on our campus
8743493 was that students dont know their rights so we began a nationwide public education campaign
8743494 a surprising aspect of campuses as revealed in our work is the variety of manifestations of anti semitism such as intimidation from professors or the cultivation of a hostile environment from outside speakers or intimidation from other students it is different at each institution
8743495 anytime there is an episode of anti semitism san francisco state university president robert corrigan calls together jewish faculty community representatives student representatives from hillel and the anti defamation league and others to coordinate a response
8743496 forceful energetic administration led by presidents like corrigan who are very forthright and firm in their indications
8743497 with an administration willing to speak publicly and honestly about the issues there is no sweeping anything under the rug
8743498 to inform motivate and encourage faculty to use their academic skills and disciplines on campus in classrooms and in academic publications to develop effective responses to the ideological distortions including anti semitic and anti zionist slanders that poison debate and work against peace
8743499 if we talk to our colleagues in understandable language we reach them we need to be more than an israel advocacy group or a jewish group
8743500 arent always the outcome the complainant wants just because we organizationally disagree with a professor does not mean what he she said is actionable

8743558 to go against party policy in round one is bad enough to go against party policy and platform in round two as far as im concerned is unforgivable
8743559 ive sought the advice of the csiro geoscience australia and additionally the chief scientist to provide me with guidance as to the best environmental standard that we need to set for the processes
8743560 im confident that the process will be at worlds best practice in terms of disposal of waste
8743561 advice is clear to me that in terms of storing this material whether you store it above ground whether you store it in drums or whether you do re inject it into a saline aquifer the last option of re injecting it into the saline aquifer is considered by all the scientific advice that came to me to be the best most effective most environmentally safe way of dealing with the waste
8743562 ive said yes to the uranium mine because the proposal wont produce any adverse significant impacts on matters of national environment significance
8743563 obviously im very disappointed in the consequence of this debate but completely accept that this is a democratic party

8743566 im the environment minister of the government i have got to discharge my responsibilities as environment minister not on the basis of a personal view one way or the other but to get the best environmental outcomes i can
8743567 my views about this issue have been well known and i did oppose at the conference the change in policy
8743568 but i also made it clear that if it was the democratic will of the party that the policy would change and if that was the governments policy position that i would support it
8743569 im a cabinet minister and as a consequence of my role as effectively a decision maker i see my task now as being to make sure that we set the best possible environment standards we can

8743678 i know a bit about what the others are doing but im trying to concentrate on what im doing
8743679 ive played well here and have good feelings about this course so yeah im ready to go out and play

8743681 seeing that im up to 37 in the fedexcup points now i want to get in the tour championship
8743682 that would be a dream come true especially for my first year out here but i think its realistic right now so im just going to try and work hard and continue to play the golf ive been playing and if im able to possibly do that i think its doable

8743723 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8743724 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop

8743818 er from what i understand non executive directors cannot work for the company and the criterion is that they must contribute in some way
8743819 actually it means you must not have a stake in the company or shares in the company
8743820 based on the considerations set out in this letter and the information available to us as at the latest practicable date we are of the opinion there are insufficient compelling reasons to accept the offers and the options proposal accordingly our recommendation to the indepen dent directors of the company is that they should recommend the shareholders to reject the offers and or the options proposal
8743821 because of the market need for various levels of conductivity and compression we purposefully looked to develop not just one product but an entire line that would meet customer requirements

8743830 the institutions in the area have not created an environment to make an impact and there is a lack of critical mass for the arts

8743839 as the company for women and on this occasion of 50 years in brazil avon is keenly aware of how important it is to work to put an end to this type of violence
8743840 we also understand how delicate the problem is and the need to involve different sectors of society in this human rights issue which is why our public private partnership with unifem is so powerful
8743841 i find it shocking that one billion women globally that is one in every three women are affected by violence at some point in their lives in latin america between 30 and 40 percent of all women aged fifteen or older have been subjected to some form of violence most often by a member of their own family
8743842 thats a statistic we must try to change and the womens empowerment bracelet is a great way for everyone to contribute

8743847 it is a great feeling to be back with tampines to be home i have been working my socks off to prove myself and now i feel i am ready to be back
8743848 of course im happy lah its very good to play alongside alam shah with him guiding me too
8743849 i always worry about being able to score and getting enough time to play especially with the fasting month around the corner
8743850 but i know tampines and i believe i will get lots of chances to score with them
8743851 to be fair to the other players i dont think he will get to start but im pretty sure a player of his calibre will play a part in the match
8743852 tampines have an abundance of strikers so with or without noh alam shah it is always going to be difficult against them
8743853 we are not going to play a defensive game we will stick to our usual style there will be no special plans to man mark any player

8743861 the fact that it also meets ul 94 v 0 requirements even at a thin profile means r10400 m has set a new standard for the industry
8743862 we are dismayed the mexican supreme court would ignore the overwhelming evidence that abortion hurts women upholding this law demonstrates a total lack of concern for the health and welfare of mexican women
8743863 unfortunately in the wake of this decision other latin american countries will be pressured by abortion advocates many from outside latin america to liberalize their abortion laws and put women at risk
8743864 latin american countries currently have some of the most protective abortion laws in the world
8743865 but they are facing increased pressure to cave into the demands of extremist groups like planned parenthood and the center for reproductive rights
8743866 in addition to ignoring womens health in upholding this law the court ignored the clear language of mexicos constitution which provides that life must be defended from the point of conception
8743867 we have walked out because they have refused to respond many members of parliament mps requested a select committee to be formed but the minister home minister syed hamid albar refused
8743868 there is no point staying and participating in the debate
8743869 they walked out contrary to the rules because they dont want to accept defeat they know that they will be defeated
8743870 they walked out because they dont want it to appear like a failure for its leader who has said that he will be able to win overbarisan nasional mps

8743901 ifrs represents a new chapter in u s public reporting requirements and with that a fundamental shift in how we view accounting and financial reporting financial executives of companies across all industry sectors will need to fully understand the impact ifrs will have on their organization including the potential costs and benefits
8743902 the impact ifrs will have on companies in each industry sector will vary depending on the issues unique to the sector some companies have significant regulatory and capital market considerations while others may have complex organizational structures that include multiple subsidiaries and joint venture relationships this series is intended to help financial executives understand the key issues affecting their industry so they can make informed decisions on when and how to embark on conversion to ifrs in a more measured way
8743903 no question about it a successful ifrs conversion project will involve not only understanding the technical accounting and financial reporting issues but also issues around internal processes and controls regulatory statutory and management reporting technology infrastructure and organizational issues such as tax treasury and cash management legal and human resources

8743932 and we also have a great chance of beating manchester united in a couple of weeks
8743933 its still early in the season but keane looks like he could form a good partnership with torres as long as robbie keane does what robbie keane can do well
8743934 we have got to do better against the big teams this time liverpool have beaten them in the fa cup and in europe but cant seem to take points off them in the league
8743935 i have a company like premier pitch in the uk and im also helping out with my wifes charity in liverpool
8743936 liverpool have given me fantastic support even to my family and i hope i havent let them down too much in the past
8743937 its important to get children involved in football at the grassroots starting at the beginning can only help the kids
8743938 programme is nothing more than an illegal pyramid scheme utterly dependent on an ever increasing number of new investors to pay existing ones
8743939 the defendants have employed schemes artifices and practices of business which have operated as a fraud and deceit
8743940 during 2007 a total of us 4 4 million in interest payments were made to those investors of which us 3 3 million came from funds received from subsequent investors not profits generated by the company from oil and gas production

8743947 die zahl der entlassenen menschen die arbeitslosengeld beantragen ist zu hoch f r einen eine gesunde konjunktur ich denke sie ist eine wichtige indikation daf r dass die wirtschaft schw cher ist als die 3 3 wirtschaftswachstum nahelegen
8743948 um misshandlungen besser erkennen zu k nnen muss der staat k nftig st rker auf kleinkinder achten denn bisher bekommen erzieher die kinder ja erst ab kindergarten oder schulalter zu sehen
8743949 we hope that resorts world will reconsider their decision to keep whale sharks in captivity
8743950 they have already taken the progressive step of leaving sharks fin off their menu to truly contribute to marine conservations let us focus on keeping the whale sharks safe in the wild
8743951 whale sharks are not meant for confinement to glass walls
8743952 linked their deaths to the use of a chemical pesticide used to treat tank parasites
8743953 the animals did not die because they were in captivity
8743954 the whale sharks in the marine life park will be loved and they will receive top class care the finest veterinary care technology and food

8743959 so many warnings and opportunities have been given and it is not heeded so i am sure they have exercised their authority well under the law

8743973 the residents can hold activities for everyone to take part to involve them in the youth olympics
8743974 were working with the event organiser with regards to their transport needs
8743975 not a lot of ntu undergraduates shop in this area
8743976 maybe business will be better for the food stalls but for the service line i dont think it will help much
8743977 will complement our efforts in developing jurong as a hub
8743978 part of the legacy that the youth olympic games leaves behind
8743979 were are also paying school fees so our needs should be prioritized
8743980 im concerned that the hostel fees might go up after all the upgrading
8743981 as far as i know they want to close the canteen for one month so they want us to propose the budget to see if they will compensate us because they might need this space to host the olympic village
8743982 if they pay us we dont mind since it would be a month long holiday
8743983 mr yang jias abnormal behaviour is a measure of abnormality in our own society
8743984 it was difficult for us but were delighted now there are no easy games in europe
8743985 die bip daten werden das gerede ber eine rezession zum schweigen bringen
8743986 a movie can give you visuals but an opera is live you can interact with the performer
8743987 it is known that by preventing the people from getting influenza through vaccination they are able to decrease the number of sick days people have as a result of influenza infections
8743988 the most populated areas in the world are actually in asia so with a greater so called breeding ground it is not surprising that a lot of the new viruses are originating from asia
8743989 i have been for international events and never have i seen volunteers so well trained at one point i saw an angry spectator scolding a volunteer and you should see the group of them coming together to try their best to explain all still smiling to the spectator how could the spectator then respond with aggressiveness
8743990 look at our bring your own bag day its once a week but how many singaporeans remember that when they shop on wednesdays
8743991 make their own films about what it means to be kind
8743992 there was a togetherness and focus and efficiency and that is what you want when there is so much at stake it was a big mental test
8743993 if you told me you wanted bacon earlier i would have bought some and cooked for you
8743994 i did not know i wanted bacon with the eggs until you served me without it
8743995 if i had asked people what they wanted most likely they would have told me they wanted a faster horse but i just knew people wanted the faster way of transportation that is why i have created this vehicle
8743996 find what you can do for others that would make them happy and act on it

8743999 f r bem hungen ein die einheit eines staates und seine territoriale integrit t zu wahren
8744000 mein freund kouchner auch davon gesprochen dass wir bald moldawien die ukraine und die krim angreifen werden
8744001 aber das ist eine krankhafte fantasie und das gilt genauso f r die sanktionen
8744002 entitled to get back the rm30 000 which we had spent in order to get his service
8744003 we were under the impression that he would explode from his first match with us after giving him a number of opportunities he failed to score even a single goal until his last match with us thus we regard our request for the rm30 000 is a justifiable act
8744004 when i was with pdrm things were fine and there were no problems when the contract was over i am surprised they are asking for money now
8744005 i keep training but i have no chance to play
8744006 and if i do not get to play how will i make the national team
8744007 the association which a player wishes to leave has not issued an irtc or given a valid reason why it refuses to do so
8744008 30 days from the date of the request from the prospective association
8744009 we are always sympathetic to the players so we will certainly try if we can do something for him
8744010 theyve had some great wins in the past five weeks i expect them to come here and you know i think they want to redeem from round one
8744011 i think they want to get a win and finish the season pretty happy with themselves
8744012 volume wise asia is going to be the growth engine of the future with demand declining in western europe and essentially staying flat in north america
8744013 we sold over 20 per cent more lubricants year on year than in 2006 in china in a market which grew at around 7 per cent
8744014 asia pacific excluding japan is set to grow about an average of 7 6 per cent for the next three to five years backed by strong acceleration in india taiwan and asean economies in 2010 12
8744015 this will be the largest display of turf equipment in north mississippi this year
8744016 this is a must attend event for everyone interested in turfgrass management
8744017 we have taken the approach of asking what we can do to help singaporeans at each stage or aspect of their journey as parents
8744018 this package is not only about helping to increase our birth rate ultimately it is about making singapore a great place for families
8744019 horses used for intercollegiate athletic competition are not polished show animals and some riders cant handle that situation
8744020 intercollegiate competition takes an individual who understands horses and wont get intimidated by quirks in their behavior
8744021 horses pick up on your mood and emotions and they are good listeners when you dont want to talk to other people
8744022 we have a successful equestrian team that was years in the making
8744023 the students on the team have a passion for horses and we offer them opportunities to live that passion by supporting an equestrian team
8744024 there is a unique dynamic about this type of competition
8744025 riders dont have to own or haul a horse and carry tack they sometimes share clothes hats and chaps and they think of one another as a team rather than as rivals
8744026 mississippi state has discussed the inclusion of a varsity equestrian program in the future and we are working on a plan with auburn university to schedule a scrimmage between their varsity team and open riders from our hunt seat and stock seat teams
8744027 if one of us wins we get together and discuss what the judge had to say
8744028 was the back straight was the gait right and did the rider maintain the correct body position
8744029 beginners are just as valuable to a teams performance as the expert riders are
8744030 a team has to have strong riders in each division to accumulate points to add to the team total and its exciting to see these riders make their way up
8744031 most of our riders are students who will graduate and seek employment in a professional career or pursue a graduate degree
8744032 since they told me about becoming closer ive been thinking about it and i just wanted to go out there take a breath trust my stuff and go after the hitters
8744033 i didnt want to waste any pitches the next time i want to go about it the same way i dont want to give them any chance to use strategy i dont want to joke around with the hitters
8744034 they are going to be fantastic games the rivalry is there between scotland and england we played against them a couple of years ago and got a victory it promises to be a great atmosphere in both games
8744035 our home form is very good its just our away form that has been very poor if we can get that right it will go a long way to getting through to the next round
8744036 we dont have to travel far and the fixtures have fallen nicely weve got a home game against villarreal in between the games against liverpool and chelsea
8744037 i remember the last game at celtic distinctly they beat us to qualify and the atmosphere from their fans was unbelievable they will be two huge games
8744038 with our spanish contingent that will be a couple of very big games and there will be a lot of attention focused on those
8744039 theyve got some very good players and if theres one team in the last pot we didnt want to sign it was them
8744040 we know all of the teams quite well for different reasons
8744041 if you come down to the training ground you will see the boys are totally focused on the champions league
8744042 we have always been the bridesmaids weve been to four semi finals and a final we want to go one better this year
8744043 its an interesting draw a bit of mixed bag the romanian team is interesting because im not aware of them well have to do our homework
8744044 one of the issues for arsene is the distances we have to travel they are long trips and he prefers more local matches so we get back a little sooner
8744045 i think i just had a lot more power than she did today
8744046 i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08 so thats pretty much the goal
8744047 i guess im kind of overdue but youve got to win it to deserve it
8744048 i was up 4 1 up in the first set and then i let it go to 4 4
8744049 if you break a mans legs he will befriend anyone with a crutch
8744050 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8744051 we cant continue to increase exports while their product is increasing at that level
8744052 something has got to give theyre our customers we want the market but things change over time
8744053 russian protein industries are not developed enough to support the countrys needs
8744054 chicken leg prices and to a lesser extent pork prices would be significantly pressured
8744055 if the whitsunday region was good enough to protect from shale oil development its good enough to protect in 2038 and 2048 and 2058
8744056 the buck stops with the minister or ministers in this case

8744060 a direct 8 billion and potentially up to 20 billion dollars in terms of what youre likely to get out of this
8744061 we expect to see a lot of repeat customers from past hurricane evacuations
8744062 the horse park is an ideal facility far enough from the coast to be safe but not too far to drive
8744063 it has excellent stalls arenas rv hook ups showers and bathrooms it is also a location that is very hospitable to other animals fleeing the storm with families
8744064 we want people to feel welcome and comfortable coming to this facility and to this community to ride out the storm
8744065 in past years local horse owners donated hay and assisted with animal care our intention is to expand our care for future refugees by providing snacks and a meal each day
8744066 these are among the most sturdy facilities available for animals most of mississippis agricenters are fairly new and high quality facilities that will be comfortable for animals and people
8744067 if emergency management is recommending people leave the coast because of pending weather horses and other animals need to evacuate also
8744068 when a hurricane approaches horse owners want to have their animals in the first wave of refugees leaving the warning area to avoid getting caught in traffic and risking overheating trucks pulling trailers
8744069 when evacuation orders are given all people should leave its not unusual to have to leave some animals behind during an evacuation make sure they have at least a weeks worth of food and water and some sort of identification on them
8744070 some people spray paint phone numbers on horses and livestock or use permanent markers on hooves identification tags can be woven into the mane to help reunite animals with owners if fencing is damaged
8744071 most people do not have horse blinders but other materials can be adapted for that purpose ive seen handlers use life jackets and bras to cover horses eyes
8744072 during a time of stress horses will be prone to specific types of injuries and illnesses including cuts and abrasions colic and laminitis lameness
8744073 the tupelo site has been designated as environmentally conscious and the company is in the position of having an impact on its employees and the community
8744074 the best way to learn about the sciences is through hands on activities we will use this money to introduce some new programs to our youth
8744075 this is an exciting way to get new audiences for 4 h
8744076 this grant money will help us build a new level of technology with new curricula
8744077 it will allow us to do some things weve wanted to do
8744078 we have recognized the importance of increasing our efforts to do more with environmental education
8744079 this program covers much material and uses interesting easy to do activities to show students such things as how different soil types support plant life what makes up good soil and about watersheds run off and drinkable water
8744080 were learning this curriculum so we can introduce it to our youth

8744086 weve made great progress and thats blessed and obama is part of that
8744087 the civil rights law that passed in 1964 was first proposed by eisenhower in 1957 and the democrats would not allow it to become law
8744088 when all those white dixiecrats like strom thurmond and others who fled and abandoned the democratic party over the issue of integration
8744089 hes a seasoned guy and i think thats important in this fight we have
8744090 and you dont bring a rookie to this time in our country
8744091 it is a wonderful opportunity for america to have a leader as gifted as blessed as inspirational as thoughtful and as competent as barack obama
8744092 i think weve made a lot of progress we have and we continue to make progress
8744093 there is nothing in gustavs path that will hinder development
8744094 there is a strong probability that it will be a category 3 storm by the time it enters the gulf and it has the potential to strengthen into a category 4 or 5 storm over the gulf
8744095 we are continuing to monitor this storm as state government agencies including the state police and the louisiana national guard have been put on standby so we are ready to quickly respond if the storm heads our direction
8744096 in the review process there were some individuals that just didnt want it published
8744097 on the other end of the spectrum i think theres going to be some hostility too
8744098 for some people its going to be perceived that this paper is a direct affront to their way of life and its not going to be received well i know from discussions over the past three to five years some people just dont want to hear it
8744099 our study clearly shows that some of the research that is being done on bears comes at a cost to the animal i know some scientists arent going to like it but i think its time that they and animal care organizations start reconsidering the kind of guidelines we currently use in the capturing and handling of all animals not just bears we also need government to support research that minimize the effects of capture
8744100 we have to look at it as the cumulative effect of a number of stressors which include drugs method of capture and handling procedures you add all that stuff together and it equals a significant amount of stress which some animals can cope with and others cant
8744101 repeated captures could contribute to that effect but i would not want to dismiss the potential effects of global warming
8744102 the bear goes off on its way and you retrieve the dart and you have your skin sample in it
8744103 but saying that i think we can reduce the number of animals we capture i think we can also put effort in finding alternative ways of finding information from animals without capturing
8744104 its nothing to have 100 people in line when we open the doors in the morning
8744105 the barnett shale is what brings me here every day

8744115 i think i knew how to say roll tide before i knew how to say my name
8744116 people say i was a walk on when i got to alabama but i like to say i was a crawl on
8744117 i give a great deal of credit to coach bill curry and coach bowden said swinney
8744118 they made you do it the hard way by going through the weight program coach bowden taught me so much he was my position coach and i learned a great deal from him that i still apply today
8744119 i stayed in touch with dabo after i coached him
8744120 he was a tough player and very responsible in everything that he did he has carried that on into coaching
8744121 at the time playing in a game as a freshman was a great goal and i accomplished that
8744122 there are so many boys who grow up in alabama wanting to play football to play at a place where coach bear bryant had coached i just did not think it could get any better than that
8744123 there are not enough pages in this book to tell you how much i learned from coach stallings
8744124 he was a tough competitor that loved his family his players and coaches im so blessed to have had the chance to first play for and later coach for coach stallings
8744125 he was a non scholarship player who earned a scholarship after he finished his playing days he became a graduate assistant for me and was then a full time coach
8744126 people talk about guys that are the first to come and the last to leave
8744127 i was never impressed by that what has impressed me was getting the most from your abilities did just that for me as a player and a coach
8744128 coach stallings is the ultimate example of how to be a good husband and good father
8744129 he is an example that i try to emulate with my wife kathleen and boys will 10 drew 8 and clay 5 im so blessed to have had him as an example of how to balance football with life
8744130 john mark was an inspiration to us all said swinney
8744131 the love between coach stallings and john mark was a very special thing he will be greatly missed and remembered by all that knew him
8744132 the 1995 season had just finished and i had earned my mba
8744133 i was 26 years old and thought it was time to move on
8744134 coach stallings told me that i knew as much about football as he did when he was 29 years old and the head coach at texas a amp m he could have hired anybody in the country but he gave me a chance
8744135 after he went to kentucky and then to auburn i would always speak to him before and after games when he had this opening at clemson it was something i was very interested in
8744136 the key is developing relationships and being honest if you are going to have success over the long haul you have to be who you are when you are in a young mans home on the in home visit and are not honest those families will see right through it
8744137 clemson is a great school coach bowden has a tremendous record but not only in wins and losses the academic and personal success of our players and the facilities here make it easy to attract great talent he has done a phenomenal job putting this staff together
8744138 dabo has great communication skills that is very important in recruiting and advancement in the profession for that matter he has a unique ability to develop relationships with recruits and their families
8744139 both are schools in a state that doesnt have a huge population with no professional sports both have in state rivals both have passionate fan bases that live and die with us each week as a coach you want to be at a place where people care and that is certainly the case at clemson and alabama
8744140 im very driven to be a part of a championship at clemson
8744141 clemson is a very unique place that is one of the reasons i have stayed here we have passionate fans i know they feel they have been wandering in the desert for a long time and want to get to the promised land our coaches and players want the exact same thing
8744142 i had never lived anywhere but alabama for the first 33 years of my life
8744143 but it did not take long for my family and i to fall in love with this place clemson is a just wonderful college town i know that it has been written that there is something in these hills and that is definitely true there is something here that really takes hold of you our family has been blessed to be here
8744144 i will always love the university of alabama but august 30 will be the first time in my life that i pull against the tide
8744145 in this business we all work so hard both the coaches and the players my only focus is to help clemson win when it kicks off we might as well be playing alaska instead of alabama i just want to win for this game for our program and our fans
8744146 hmmm ive seen those i think theres some over there in the wall decor and stuff on an endcap we didnt really know what they were for

8744149 it is likely volumes will remain muted until buyers sellers borrowers lenders and their expectations of rates and terms match closely enough for transaction activity to pick back up
8744150 id never heard that before but its good to know
8744151 what do you do when business dries up because the economy is booming
8744152 look i can understand your concerns about my prices but if youre looking for a bargain broker my competitor across the street might be able to help you out make sure you ask him though about regulation 13 7 of the township code and how that affects the four properties you saw on trulia oh and ask him his opinion on giuliano amp sons because theyre the contractors who did the work on 14 main street which should be your first choice given your family situation if you change your mind and want me to help you you have my card
8744153 the difference here is you know hes got a few other things going
8744154 its hard to find the quality time to do this
8744155 the hardest part about writing a speech like this is not the mechanics of it but what you want to say and how youre going to say it the strategy of it
8744156 when youre working with senator obama the main player on a speech is senator obama
8744157 he is the best speechwriter in the group and he knows what he wants to say and he generally says it better than anybody else would
8744158 this is going to be a more workmanlike speech im not aiming for a lot of high rhetoric im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8744159 i may not be as good as the other headliners the other three nights but hopefully itll make clear the choices the american people are going to face in november
8744160 i came to congress with a simple mandate from my constituents lower the amount of wasteful government spending
8744161 rising costs of living including gasoline and food reinforce the need to reduce unnecessary and duplicative federal spending and keeping the tax burden low on illinois hard working families
8744162 republicans and democrats alike have spent years wasting taxpayer dollars but the american people have awakened
8744163 now is the time not tomorrow to hold the line on government spending

8744169 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams
8744170 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
8744171 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
8744172 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
8744173 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation

8744199 when i left boston i was mad at them and mad at the league so i requested 69 thinking that theyd really have to suck on it if you know what im saying
8744200 well the folks here in l a told me that they would give me number 69 and then when they gave me the uniform they said here you go manny 69 just like you wanted well it turns out theyre liars too just like the red sox and everyone else
8744201 listen there was no way we were going to give him number 69
8744202 bud selig would never go for it our fans would never go for it even my wife would probably freak out over it and she didnt even watch our games until manny got here it just wasnt going to happen so we decided to just give him 99 and hope that he didnt notice you gotta admit it worked for a pretty long time
8744203 i would of course have preferred to have a thinly veiled reference to mutual oral sex on my uniform but ill take the number thats merely an oddity just the same i just dont like being lied to you know what i mean

8744227 the last time we came here for some reason i played a weakened team
8744228 we had a lot of reserves in our line up as we had a monday game to follow against
8744229 when i saw lazio celebrating as if they had won the world cup i thought that wont happen again
8744230 the game tomorrow is extremely important we did not realise that a few years ago
8744231 there are no league games to distract us so there is no excuse this time
8744232 we need to go out and get the victory as this is a prestigious game and one we want to win there is a great incentive for us
8744233 fabio will need players who are 100 fit to play a game of that nature against croatia
8744234 owen will not be ready as he needs recovery time as well as getting down to training
8744235 it has not been easy for him having tendinitis can be irritating for a player
8744236 but he has trained for 10 days and it is now important to give him some minutes on the pitch
8744237 what he is doing there is fantastic the dutch have always been travellers in football and do not mind coaching anywhere
8744238 that is a great asset to have dick for his part has been in places as far apart as glasgow and st petersburg
8744239 when he was in charge of holland he was one of the best at understanding the dilemma of a club manager
8744240 he has proved to be a successful and competent coach you just have to look at his record with zenit
8744241 zenit were the best team in the competition they overcame leverkusen and bayern munich on the way as well
8744242 you tend to take notice of of results like that and their attacking play captured a lot of peoples attention
8744243 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8744244 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8744245 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8744246 do you have the duo core optimizer from that page installed
8744247 where the early adopters and the discretionary spenders were leading the charge now as we go into the 30 percent range for planned purchases the change to apple looks permanent what we have in the end actually were sort of there now is that buying an apple is as normal as buying a dell or an hp computer in america
8744248 you want to see what a halo effect looks like take a look at last year
8744249 this years halo isnt to the degree of last years but in this economic environment and the fact that apples hitting its biggest numbers ever means its enough to see apple significantly outperform expectations going forward
8744250 everything else equal apples outperforming in an incredibly difficult consumer spending environment
8744251 yo creo que cuando este rumor comenz este rumor mal infundado por el doctor rodrigo borja cevallos nosotros est bamos bastante peque os y se lo dej como un simple rumor que no se le dio importancia pero este rumor en lugar de desaparecer en estos doce a os que mi padre tiene en el exilio ha sido repetido tantas veces que hay una gran parte de la poblaci n que piensa que es cierto
8744252 pero m s all de eso yo creo que ahora que ya soy un hombre de 26 a os que tengo tres hijos y un hogar bendecido por dios y en mi calidad de director nacional del partido roldosista ecuatoriano pre creo que ah hay que hacer un alto a las cr ticas en contra de mi familia cada persona que utilice un medio de comunicaci n para afectar o lesionar el honor de la familia bucaram que es una familia que le ha dado tanto a la pol tica nacional y que el pueblo tanto ha querido y que ha sido v ctima precisamente de la partidocracia cada persona que injurie calumniosamente como est tipificado el delito de injuria calumniosa en el art culo 489 del c digo penal tiene que responder con pruebas a sus aseveraciones
8744253 entonces si el columnista emilio palacio sostiene que jacobo bucaram pulley se gan un mill n de d lares con la ayuda de su padre tendr que comprobarlo con pruebas en los tribunales judiciales caso contrario habr procedido a cometer el delito tipificado como antes lo mencion que injuria calumniosa que concluye con seis meses a dos a os de prisi n
8744254 porque lo vimos como una calumnia m s pero este rumor que se ha repetido tantos a os ha afectado mucho a la imagen de mi hermano entonces yo el tema no lo voy a defender apasionadamente con el coraz n sino en los tribunales judiciales
8744255 si el se or sostiene que esa mentira infundada es verdad bueno compru bemelo si no tiene las pruebas valederas para comprobarlo tendr que ir a la c rcel porque no se puede permitir que ning n ser humano acuse a una familia honorable o a cualquier miembro de una familia con aseveraciones que jur dicamente no puede respaldarlas si yo el d a de ma ana salgo a decir que el se or emilio palacio lo contrario se ha ganado un mill n de d lares en la prensa yo tengo que comprobarlo caso contrario tengo que pagar por mis aseveraciones que no est n sustentadas en el campo del derecho
8744256 yo soy abogado y voy a actuar no solo como hermano hastiado y cansado y como hijo hastiado y cansado de que se hable de mi familia las personas pueden tener el derecho de decir lo que les d la gana de otras personas pero tienen que comprobarlo no pueden adjudicarle un delito de tal magnitud y ante un medio de comunicaci n que te ven millones de personas y salir a repetir rumores que t consideras verdaderos si son rumores que t consideras verdaderos y los aseveras como lo asever el columnista emilio palacio en el programa contacto directo dirigido por carlos vera en la se al de ecuavisa tienes que probarlo ese es mi nico punto de vista
8744257 si el se or el d a de ma ana me presenta en los campos judiciales estados de cuenta dep sitos que demuestren que su rumor es cierto est bien entonces habr comprobado ese rumor mal infundado en los campos judiciales pero si no tiene c mo probarlo como estoy seguro de que as ser porque como hermano puedo dar fe y como cristiano practicante como cristiano activo puedo dar fe de que mi hermano jam s cometi el delito entonces no va a tener c mo probarlo y tendr que pagar por sus aseveraciones
8744258 yo creo que ese fue su error yo creo que l debi haber desmentido desde un principio ese rumor pero bueno uno nunca sabe c mo terminan las cosas solo sabe c mo comienzan

8744282 estamos siendo sometidos a un chantaje por parte de la transportaci n pero en todo caso en este momento vamos a tener una reuni n con ellos y con las autoridades del municipio de quito porque esta es una responsabilidad expresa del municipio de quito
8744283 a trav s de decretos ejecutivos fueron transferidas las competencias y entre esas competencias esta fijar tarifas
8744284 hasta que el municipio no asuma su responsabilidad como tal que se realicen los estudios necesarios para fijar una tarifa en base a los costos la oferta y la demanda en ese sentido el municipio tiene que cumplir para que en ese momento ellos puedan solicitar al ministerio de transporte o al estado la ayuda que sea necesaria
8744285 no hay estudios definitivos ellos han presentado un an lisis sobre la situaci n pero un informe sobre el tema no existe y no lo han presentado
8744286 la posici n del gobierno es que vamos a reunirnos vamos a escuchar a la transportaci n y luego se definir n las acciones que se tomar n pero no estamos de acuerdo con que la transportaci n se paralice

8744306 it wouldnt surprise me barack if you took the state of iowa
8744307 i think that this is going to be one of the greatest speeches and probably comparable to the i have a dream speech
8744308 no puedo entender si no realmente en la malicia en la desinformaci n o en la desesperaci n estos conatos que confiando en la justicia en la seriedad de una entidad en la que creo que quien la preside hoy d a tendr todo el apoyo de la asamblea para que la verdad aflore no se puede quedar en sombras de duda sobre lo hecho en la asamblea
8744309 coincidentemente otros que son del mismo grupo del no o del no camuflado extra amente aparecen con un documento que seg n el contralor que me env a y entrega en mis manos el ltimo d a de la asamblea el 24 de julio
8744310 no tengo porque proteger ni ocultar lo que dice cualquier proceso de auditor a es que los informes que hacen los auditores no son la ltima palabra en este caso no tengo nada que ver en este caso si cree alguien que estoy tapando algo yo no tengo ninguna implicaci n pero no por eso me porto irresponsable hay 130 personas involucradas
8744311 el contralor de la rep blica con una advertencia que este documento es el nico un igual lo tengo yo el contralor tiene el uno guardado en su despacho y el otro tengo yo porque de acuerdo con el convenio se dice que terminado el informe se le entregar al presidente de la asamblea para el tr mite pertinente y la publicaci n
8744312 hay un asamble stas jorge escala que denuncia a fausto lupera porque una persona contratada por l vive fuera del pa s y funge como asesor del se or lupera la comisi n directiva de la asamblea el 5 de junio aprovechando la visita del contralor le proponemos la firma de un convenio
8744313 que se revise a todos los asamble stas eso fue solicitado y vigilado por nosotros para que se cumpla todos fuimos sometidos a vigilancia todos fuimos investigados y en ese caso esos resultado tienen que ser comunicados a nosotros que fuimos investigados
8744314 yo no respondo por ellos dicen que se est n enterando por la prensa habr a que apelar a los auditores para saber si les comunicaron o no porque en estos temas realmente hay que ser muy diligentes prolijos porque si no se generan nulidades y eso da an los procesos de auditor a
8744315 en algunos casos tengo evidencias de cartas de descargo pero que no han sido tramitadas en el propio procedimiento de la contralor a podr a estarse inobservado no por culpa de la contralor a si no por culpa del convenio el propio proceso de auditor a de la contralor a cuando llega a estos estados informa les llama a los involucrados y hace la lectura y permite el descargo
8744316 para m no es final y para nadie es final porque en definitiva cuando van a poder presentar los descargos en algunos casos he visto cartas que han presentado el descargo pero la contralor a dice ya no estamos actuando esto ya est en manos de la asamblea la asamblea es un rgano legislativo creado por el pueblo para hacer la constituci n no para hacer auditorias por eso le pedimos a la contralor a
8744317 esta tarde pedir al contralor que l mismo con todas las caracter sticas que tiene la auditor a de la contralor a en el mismo marco del convenio de colaboraci n contin en con el proceso porque es legitimo que se haga la lectura de este documento para que se puedan hacer los descargos independientemente de que el se or ministro fiscal contin e haciendo las investigaciones si es que hay presunciones de implicaciones penales
8744318 si han cometido eso que es grav simo de suplantar firmas personas de falsificar documentos p blicos que pena por ellos si eso fuera as pero me parece absurdo es contrario a la tica
8744319 no se puede hacer el esc ndalo de la magnitud que est n haciendo yo no tengo nada que ocultar lo que no negocio son mis principios creo en el debido proceso creo en la transparencia para que la verdad prevalezca
8744320 no puede ser posible que usando las viejas herramientas del viejo pa s de la partidocracia moribunda aparezca un joven que dice ser adem s de las personas que quieren un nuevo pa s que es de la patria activa y soberana y por hacer noticia caiga en estos actos tan corruptos como los que se quieren perseguir que en este caso es averiguar injuriar a personas que no tengo porque responsabilizarme de esta transgresi n
8744321 no he hecho p blico el documento porque para hacerlo p blico ten a que cumplir con un debido proceso el se or fiscal de la rep blica est haciendo lo que tiene que hacer y todo lo que implicar a el delito si todo eso esta precautelado porque tenemos que acelerar esta conferencia final en pleno momento de las elecciones
8744322 eso le toca dilucidar al ministerio fiscal que tiene que indagar si hay la falsificaci n de firmas si es que hay en este caso alteraci n de documentos si configura o no el peculado independientemente que yo no est involucrado en el caso a t tulo personal me parece que es un atentado contra la asamblea que se le quiera desnaturalizar a un proceso generado en la propia asamblea

8744337 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8744338 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8744339 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8744340 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8744341 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8744342 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8744343 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8744344 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8744345 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8744346 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8744347 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8744354 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8744355 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8744356 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8744357 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8744358 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8744359 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8744360 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8744361 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8744362 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8744363 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8744364 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8744365 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8744366 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8744367 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8744368 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8744369 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8744370 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

8744372 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8744373 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8744374 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8744375 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8744376 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8744377 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8744378 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8744379 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8744380 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8744381 who are open to doing something on the production side
8744382 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8744383 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8744384 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

8744388 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8744389 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8744390 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8744391 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

8744397 i went to new orleans a few days ago just for the night
8744398 i have a brace that helps me with my posture and i was wearing it and he was looking at me like i was crazy

8744400 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8744401 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8744402 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8744403 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8744404 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8744405 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8744406 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8744407 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8744408 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8744409 ca peut aller je crois que jai que des gratignures
8744410 je me gare je reviens tout de suite je me gare
8744411 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8744412 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8744413 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8744414 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8744415 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8744416 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

8744425 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8744426 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8744427 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8744428 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8744429 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8744430 developed cooperatively by at amp t and enterprise mobile and is an exclusive offering designed to assist at amp t customers with deploying the microsoft mobility solution
8744431 the palo alto community is very interested in electric cars and hybrid cars
8744432 there will not be a whole huge amount of these plug ins when they do become available
8744433 one toyota dealer moving ahead of the pack will encourage others and help speed the arrival of plug in hybrid electric vehicles phevs into the market
8744434 weve got kevin spacey whos going to play the voice of the robot which is great but otherwise its just me and there are a couple of supporting roles of people who do transmissions onto the space station
8744435 i would say choke joshua and moon are probably the hardest things ive done and confessions of a dangerous mind but we had a longer schedule so what youre talking about with a movie like choke or any of those others youre doing a part like confessions of a dangerous mind or like fight club but youre doing it in a month so you can imagine its taxing on everybody
8744436 come hang out with us at the santa monica pier

8744443 the costs of raw materials and purchased components have been rising at unprecedented rates for the past few years and have continued throughout 2008 steel costs have more than doubled this year alone and aluminum is now projected to increase another 45 percent by year end while we have historically adjusted our pricing models as material costs have climbed over time we felt that with such significant adjustments we owe it to our customers to provide them as much advanced notice as possible as always we continue to aggressively seek ways to contain costs and provide the best value to our customers

8744451 be kind for everyone you meet is waging a great battle
8744452 because you never know what pain or sorrow people are dealing with and i have to remind myself constantly that im not the center of the universe my favorite book for inspiration is a childs garden of verses by robert louis stevenson because of the effect it had in liberating my imagination
8744453 shes being held at a van nuys county jail and bail has been set at 10 000
8744454 where the early adopters and the discretionary spenders were leading the charge now as we go into the 30 percent range for planned purchases the change to apple looks permanent what we have in the end actually were sort of there now is that buying an apple is as normal as buying a dell or an hp computer in america
8744455 you want to see what a halo effect looks like take a look at last year
8744456 this years halo isnt to the degree of last years but in this economic environment and the fact that apples hitting its biggest numbers ever means its enough to see apple significantly outperform expectations going forward
8744457 everything else equal apples outperforming in an incredibly difficult consumer spending environment
8744458 after all weve been through it was just such a relief and amazing feeling
8744459 we only had 3 hours so it was all about strategy and timing
8744460 and the edgy rock stars hair was so coarse and thick that it was really hard to get it to come off polished
8744461 my rock star story meant so much to me i have a dear friend who is a struggling musician and i know she is going to make it big one day
8744462 im a single woman who only has a cat so sharing a room was challenging
8744463 we had no cell phone laptops or radio you had to leave everything behind and put yourself in this most uncomfortable situation
8744464 being fed the fridge was always full of food whatever we wanted on our wish list came true
8744465 shes so hot and doesnt care about what anybody thinks and it shows

8744471 a relaxing leisurely canoe trip down the scenic little miami river a summer tradition for greater cincinnatians starting in june several people reported the scenery got disturbing a man exposing himself
8744472 common in public indecency to say they were urinating a common defense clear thats not what he was doing not according to the victims
8744473 certain amount of people thought it was funny didnt call didnt want to ruin their day others took offense and rightfully so not something you want to bring your kids to the river and worry about those sorts of things
8744474 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8744475 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is

8744501 as with the shortfall of gmail sans any reasonable featureset to compete with outlook contact manager is
8744502 in a certain sense its like starting over again my wife and i have talked about it tony and i have raced together longer than my wife and i have been married
8744503 as a profit making investment rather than a means of lining up the actual delivery of fuel
8744504 were proud of what weve done on our environmental leadership the things weve done around renewables and the things were doing to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions
8744505 so in one respect weve got a very positive story to tell and we dont have a problem it wherever we can do so
8744506 i think since thats happened youve seen a sea change in terms of the industry and frankly a lot of the regulators approach to coal plants
8744507 while everyones trying to determine whether capture and sequestration will be feasible and economical
8744508 i think it lends to credence to the arguments that weve been making that these are risky investments
8744509 and that shareholders deserve to be notified of the fact that because these are riskier investments regulators in the future may not want to pass those higher costs on to consumers meaning shareholders would be on the hook for them
8744510 youve seen a sea change in terms of the industry and frankly a lot of the regulators approach to coal plants
8744511 it remains to be seen what the reaction is to any risk level with the investment
8744512 i would think that a project like big stone ii that is more efficient would actually have more value in carbon constrained environment
8744513 in the game im so focused and sometimes too emotional off the field real mellow
8744514 my mom found out that the 1990 world cup was coming up
8744515 and that was the first one i saw i was hooked
8744516 it was great to just start getting some minutes finally
8744517 everything was starting to kind of take flight for me
8744518 at a certain point it got to where i felt like it was my team it was me and pablo
8744519 i felt like i cant just sit back i have to do more and provide more for the team so we can get some wins
8744520 everybody was not on the same page it seems like it was the players versus the staff
8744521 you didnt really know what you were doing we kind of went out and it was kind of a crapshoot how we were going to do
8744522 the games seemed to be heated they were close games and both teams hadnt won a trophy so it was a chance to win something
8744523 i thought maybe id be in colorado for my whole career so it was total shock when it happened
8744524 and im glad that it went down its a much more healthy situation here
8744525 we try and work on things that we didnt do good in the game before
8744526 that would be nice but we are more focused on reaching the playoffs and pursuing the mls cup
8744527 our luck will turn it is just a matter of time
8744528 we have not score anywhere near as many goals as our possession warranted
8744529 we have to create more but if we keep playing the way we are then the goals will come we have three or four good strikers and quite a few midfielders who love scoring goals
8744530 we are a better team this season and someone will be on the end of a hammering soon
8744531 i dont read the papers as far as im concerned i just get on with my job i speak to patrick on a daily basis and have definitely not been given that ultimatium
8744532 we are a better team than we were last season but our results are not showing that at the moment we have to turn that around with a win on saturday
8744533 were delighted to welcome tom to our family here at the zoo and were fortunate to have a horticulturist with his exemplary background in landscape development and community involvement on our staff
8744534 parent feedback what matters most and my own course updates
8744535 weve been working with zagorova and other potential new owners for months now
8744536 i think we have a real shot at picking up a seat in the 17th
8744537 i think tim probst is going to win that seat i think we have a great shot in the 18th i like our candidate there vanessa duplessie running against rep jaime herrera who has never been elected herself really has hardly been in the district the last ten years vanessa is hard working sharp articulate a real go getter
8744538 i think there is a probability of two and a possibility of four
8744539 redistricting is going to have some really interesting changes there
8744540 but i think it will still maintain a swing area
8744541 i dont think it will have a huge role but he wont have any coattails if they had a strong challenger to me that person could conceivably carry some coattails raise money rally troops etc
8744542 i dont think michael delavar is going to be able to do that
8744543 i dont want to vote for a rock star i want somebody who is going to take care of the issues
8744544 as gadgets get smaller the tradeoffs become more difficult the balance becomes more critical and theres less room for error
8744545 im not surprised its happening to the nano because thats the small one youre asking it do a lot in a very very small package and thats pushing the envelope
8744546 when you have a constant change in the devices i think you have less room to prove designs
8744547 thats more of an issue especially with portable devices because the changes are not let me move this from there the changes are always radical
8744548 what were noticing now is less the idea of miniaturization but more so the idea of lifestyle optimization
8744549 right now were at the point where technology can be more or less be any size the focus is miniaturization in just the right spot to hit the perfect balance between comfortable interaction and pocketability
8744550 anything that is new definitely opens itself up to more risk but without risk theres no reward
8744551 we designers like to push limits as much as possible and there has to be due diligence in testing but if you sit there and test and test and test you lose the chance to be innovative
8744552 batteries are a key concern most gadget related safety hazards are due to faulty cheap battery cells
8744553 we are positioning dell to win in a new era of global it spending
8744554 strategic actions to accelerate growth in certain areas of our business affected gross margins this quarter
8744555 i think weve got an environment where we didnt see much of a change from the second quarter
8744556 it really started with big corporations and weve seen slowing in state and local government spending and small to medium sized businesses as well
8744557 there really was a mix of revenue growth with margin rates being lower
8744558 this could be due to lower end products and promotion activity
8744559 sees continued conservatism in it spending in the u s
8744560 where the early adopters and the discretionary spenders were leading the charge now as we go into the 30 percent range for planned purchases the change to apple looks permanent what we have in the end actually were sort of there now is that buying an apple is as normal as buying a dell or an hp computer in america

8744596 the smart money is on mitt romney or tim pawlenty but john mccain has always been his own man and we shouldnt be surprised by a maverick pick a real go for broke pick for john mccain would be secretary of state condoleezza rice
8744597 picking a woman like condi rice as his running mate would be bold self confident and a game changing move for john mccain imagine the sparks that would fly at the vice presidential debate between secretary rice and senator biden but the utter lack of a convention bounce so far and tied polls between obama and mccain means the mccain campaign doesnt have to consider go for broke moves
8744598 consideration must be given to the revealed god on the one hand and to knowledge of the unrevealed hidden will of god on the other

8744608 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
8744609 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
8744610 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti

8744615 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
8744616 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni

8744621 da tempo ludc aveva posto lattenzione sulle aree agricole e sul censimento delle stesse
8744622 e stata necessaria la violenza su i due turisti olandesi per capire che a roma sono centinaia le strutture ex agricole abbandonate e occupate da clandestini e da persone senza fissa dimora
8744623 da anni le organizzazioni agricole chiedono di affrontare questo problema continua ciocchetti unidea dare la possibilit ai proprietari di poter farne un utilizzo produttivo cedendo al comune una parte di queste strutture per utilizzi sociali
8744624 nel programma presentato durante la campagna elettorale per sindaco tutto questo era stato menzionato e affrontato
8744625 a bunch of rocks you cant break and paths you cant cross
8744626 what i can say for sure is that its a really nice looking game
8744627 since im still just puttering around in the introductory phases i cant tell you much about how it plays
8744628 your obsession with an overweight and biased blog opinion writer is disturbing at best
8744629 det bliver et herligt efter r vi gl der os til at komme ud med de nye sange og med os har vi naturligvis ogs vores gamle repertoire der bliver lejlighed til et genh r for publikum med sangen til livet som om det var i g r solens sang og flere af de sange som vi heller ikke selv kan undv re
8744630 vi har bestr bt os p at give plads til sange tekster melodier og temaer der kan indg i en sammenh ng og alligevel f lov at stikke lidt ud vi er alle glade for resultatet og ogs lidt stolte over igen at kunne pr sentere nyt materiale for nye som gamle publikummer
8744631 its about having one event to look forward to thats more about the community than about business
8744632 im going to pax because i think it will be fun to meet cool people who share similar interests and the chance to possibly get to talk to some industry folks
8744633 the sizzle is what sells and revealing new information with lasers and booth babes attracts more attention than showing off a game that is going to be released in two weeks
8744634 the type of content at pax isnt much different than the content we had at the first show in 2004
8744635 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani

8744638 tutto quello che ho imparato nei miei otto anni da presidente e tutto il lavoro che ho fatto da allora in america e nel resto del mondo mi hanno convinto che barack luomo giusto per questo lavoro
8744639 sedici anni fa mi avete dato lonore di guidare il nostro partito alla vittoria e guidare la nazione in una nuova era di pace e prosperit insieme abbiamo battuto i repubblicani in una campagna dura nella quale venivo attaccato perch troppo giovane e inesperto per essere il comandante supremo delle forze armate vi ricorda qualcosa nel 1992 non ha funzionato perch noi eravamo dalla parte giusta della storia e non funzioner neppure nel 2008 perch anche obama dalla parte giusta della storia
8744640 quello di sapere ispirare la gente infondere la speranza guidarla verso un orizzonte pi alto ha lintelligenza e la curiosit che non possono mancare in un presidente ha mostrato di avere una chiara comprensione della politica estera delle sfide sul fronte della sicurezza nazionale e una ferma determinazione a rimettere in sesto le nostre forze armate
8744641 il mio candidato non ha vinto ha voluto sottolineare ma sono orgoglioso della sua campagna elettorale e di tutta la gente che lha sostenuta hillary far di tutto per appoggiare obama e cos siamo in due anzi siamo 18 milioni
8744642 voglio che tutti sappiano che sono orgoglioso di avere joe biden e tutta la sua famiglia al mio fianco per riprenderci lamerica

8744649 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8744650 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8744651 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8744652 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8744653 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza

8744683 dell inc said thursday that its fiscal second quarter earnings fell 17 from a year ago even as revenue topped 16 billion as the company said its margins were hurt by efforts to build out its consumer product lines and overseas markets
8744684 dell said it earned 616 million or 31 cents a share on revenue of 16 43 billion compared to a profit of 746 million or 33 cents a share on 14 78 billion in sales in the year ago quarter analysts surveyed by factset research had forecast dell to earn 36 cents a share on 15 97 billion in sales
8744685 dell didnt give a third quarter forecast saying only that the company sees continued conservatism in it spending in the u s which has begun to spread into western europe and parts of asia
8744686 dells gross margin was 17 2 in the quarter down from nearly 20 a year ago gross margins measure a companys profit after subtracting the cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue and is widely used by tech analysts as a benchmark for a companys financial health
8744687 wu said dells margins are probably being squeezed by a lower end mix as the company used special promotions and other price reductions to entice customers to buy its computers

8744750 when you fly the actual mission you feel like you are in a simulator
8744751 we really cant do our job without the good visual graphics that we get
8744752 it used to be about the computing part but the emphasis is shifting it is not so much about the computation but how it is presented and seen by people
8744753 they will be able to recreate scan data so fast you could see your own heart beating

8744758 we are honored to offer this scholarship to our nursing students
8744759 in more than 33 years at intermountain bill has championed a culture of providing the best possible care and nurses are heroes in that effort
8744760 as a board we felt this nursing scholarship was the most appropriate tribute we could pay to bill and one we hope will benefit the nursing program at his alma mater byu

8744773 if this reporter really wanted to know what their message was he would have arranged for proper interviews or approached them in their staging area wading into a bunch of chanting protesters is a great way to get the sort of chaotic footage fox adores
8744774 and bigurn clintons speech still evaded the question of obamas qualifications

8744776 i was extremely disappointed and incensed by some of her behavior during the primaries but i feel she anted up and kicked in nicely in the end
8744777 sorry to burst anyones bubble here but for her to concede to the wishes of the party only took the womens movement back 40 years ill give her this much it was a great speech but i know hillary enough to know that is was not delivered without duress and i can only imagine what kind of deal she struck with the obama folks

8744921 to ensure that the international rules meet the secs standards the agency set 2011 as a date to evaluate critical milestones and decide on mandating ifrs the secs milestones include steps to ensure that international accounting rule maker london based international accounting standards board iasb and its trustees are accountable and independent
8744922 the ifrs system is generally considered more flexible and giving companies the choice could spell the end of gaap experts believe

8744979 about a year ago we were realizing how much hype we were getting and we decided we should start to say that its going to suck just to de hype it
8744980 there is a certain amount of pressure when people dont know much about something they tend to fill in the blanks the way you want them to be filled in thats true of almost anything

8745084 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8745085 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8745086 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8745087 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8745088 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8745089 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8745090 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8745091 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8745092 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8745093 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8745094 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful

8745136 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8745137 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8745138 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8745139 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8745140 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8745141 moral legal and practical gravity to publicize it to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8745142 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8745143 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8745144 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face

8745148 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8745149 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8745150 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8745151 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8745152 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8745153 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon
8745154 coalition of israeli palestinian and international ngos united against the practice of torture and ill treatment in israel and the occupied palestinian territories opt
8745155 torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
8745156 to various stakeholders in israel and the opt including the eu tel aviv delegation ecd european commission technical assistance office for the west bank and gaza ectao eu ambassadors and or other relevant eu contact persons in eu missions and ngos particularly active in this field
8745157 the eu and its member states contribute to the prevention and eradication of torture
8745158 combat ing impunity to hold perpetrators liable establish ing reporting procedures and provid ing reparation and rehabilitation for victims
8745159 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
8745160 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
8745161 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise
8745162 israeli law has abolished the death penalty for murder and corporal punishment
8745163 fundamental human rights founded upon recognition of the value of the human being the sanctity of human life and the principle that all persons are free
8745164 to protect human life dignity and assure that all government authorities are bound to respect these rights under this basic law
8745165 officially proclaimed a state of public emergency from 19 may 1948 four days after its founding until the present day
8745166 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8745167 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8745168 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8745169 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8745170 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy

8745196 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8745197 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8745198 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8745199 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8745200 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8745201 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8745202 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop

8745204 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8745205 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8745206 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8745207 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8745208 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8745229 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8745230 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8745231 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8745232 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8745233 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8745234 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8745235 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8745236 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8745237 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8745238 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8745239 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8745240 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8745241 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8745242 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8745243 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8745244 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8745245 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8745246 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8745247 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8745248 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8745249 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8745250 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8745251 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8745252 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8745253 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8745254 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8745255 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8745256 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8745257 we cant continue to increase exports while their product is increasing at that level
8745258 something has got to give theyre our customers we want the market but things change over time
8745259 russian protein industries are not developed enough to support the countrys needs

8745261 mom where am i going to put my new bed
8745262 what are you talking about your not getting another bed my bed is big enough for the both of us
8745263 are you serious that was the whole point i wanted my own bed in the room
8745264 well then youll just have to share a room with michelle again
8745265 wait what you said i can have my own room finally how can you just take it away she told me before she was happy to be in your room because your bed is comfy why do i have to be the one to suffer
8745266 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8745267 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8745268 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8745269 these kinds of personal attacks speak volumes about where they are as a party its deeply disturbing and revealing and it highlights the fact that democrats arent confident in how their convention is going
8745270 not a single fix you suggested has corrected the problem on my g5 imac power pc interesting for most people it is the other way round
8745271 heres a twist take your choppy qt movie and export it to a wmv youll need flip4mac the resulting wmv on my system plays fine in both the windows media players and quicktime but in qtime pro take the same wmv file and re export it as a quicktime file and its back to its choppy self again so it seems that the problem with quicktime is reading quicktime files windows wmv files play fine of course that doesnt help those if us who depend on qtime to make a living my daw is not going to read a wmv file it wants to see a qt file and so do i darn it caveat may or may not apply for those without sound i have not had that problem but would be interested to hear from folks who do and if exporting to a wmv works to fix what as well apple really needs to make this a high priority fix
8745272 the common denominator of 99 of such problems and most of us have encountered some is the plain fact that no one not even apple can beta test all conceivable permutations of system and software installations that we might have and i doubt whether even two are identical
8745273 i couldnt agree more i have a close friend who writes the system decimal updates at apple and it is very complex work difficult to test every configuration
8745274 you cannot install quicktime on this volume a newer version of this software is already installed
8745275 its you mine works fine do what i say and it will all be well

8745278 i dont feel elitist at all and i think thats a really important thing to tackle
8745279 caring about the environment caring about good food caring about peace even on a micro level with bullying in the schools all the way up to how we treat each other as nations these arent elitist things and the successful branding of this stuff as elitist has contributed to the problem big time these are common sense things that we should care about every day
8745280 thats fine but whats not fine to me is when that kind of entertainment is used as a way not to think about the larger things
8745281 there was a story in the new york times magazine recently about the troops in afghanistan and one of the young marines said i bleeping cant believe people back in the states care more about britney spears than me and the other guys in my battalion
8745282 party party in a tweety land b w this republic of suffering
8745283 in a world where the human suffering inflicted by wars natural disasters hunger drug addiction and other natural manmade causes feels ever present people are increasingly becoming numb to the plight of others overwhelmed by the enormity of suffering and mired in frustration with how to alleviate it some retreat into private worlds others distract themselves with celebrity infatuation or indulge in decadent behavior to keep the world at bay some find transcendence and meaning for their own suffering through religious models
8745284 were obsessed with owning things and with the lives of total strangers the things that are really meaningful have become obscured by all this junk everywhere the touchstones that should be there for our lives to make sense are becoming increasingly obscured so you feel kind of rudderless because the things that we should be caring about like the natural world around us and peace arent valued i mean its hard to even talk about peace nowadays because its like peace is for chumps
8745285 colleen and i have chosen work that represents the ways people turn away from the suffering in the world because its too much or because they just cant think of ways to handle it
8745286 scott seekins painting of himself with britney spears or javier tavera has these amazing photographs of people at raves where theyre on another planet theyve taken themselves to another place
8745287 i think we just seek to illuminate and i think thats the role of artists and writers and other creative people we dont have all the answers nobody does but we can help illuminate a little piece of whats happening in our collective life and then everybody has to think about these things hopefully
8745288 were welcoming projects that look at the issues but we are not creating venues for people to be for or against a particular nominee

8745366 i am encouraging our fans to have a safe and fun experience at the rocky mountain showdown
8745367 at the same time i want to remind all buff fans that their conduct reflects upon the university of colorado so we want to put forth a positive statement about our character and our values show your true buff spirit but be safe and responsible in doing so
8745368 what we want to see is two engaged spirited excited groups of fans from cu and csu witnessing a friendly but intense rivalry on the field
8745369 what we dont want to see is fans competing to see who can be the most irresponsible thereby endangering their own safety and that of other fans and in the process sending the wrong message about our respective institutions
8745370 events such as the rocky mountain showdown give our student body a chance to demonstrate who we are and what we stand for
8745371 we join chancellor peterson in encouraging all cu student fans to compete like a buffalo with pride passion and class

8745381 well what if instead of that we were both olympic swimmers about to compete in the 100 meter mens freestyle and we didnt talk because we were both listening to our ipods getting ready for the race hilarious
8745382 or or or you know the other sketch yall were talking about where im a bus driver and a maniac has wired a bomb to the bus that will go off if i dont carefully follow all of the driving laws what if instead of a bus it was like an airplane to beijing and i was just sitting in first class listening to my ipod thinking about all of the races i was going to have to win and how it would be such an epic and historic accomplishment if i could pull it off

8745431 the objective reality is that apple does plenty of wrong

8745471 i think it will deter some criminal actions and i think more security is a good thing the way its going now you have to have it
8745472 i think if thats what they need to do to keep us safe i dont have nothing to hide
8745473 if they know maybe people will tone it down a notch just because its out there yeah i could see that helping
8745474 i think people should be kind of held accountable for what goes on and its probably a good thing

8745492 as long as the hurricane has louisiana in its sights this is where ill be were still hopeful that the storm will miss us but weve got to prepare as if its coming our way

8745502 open source let us take the status quo of that industry and our own limited resources and innovate
8745503 we started in 2001 as three kids fresh out of college
8745504 we took what open source had and then gave back to the community our improvements
8745505 one of our key decisions as a startup was making our software available for free download payment on the honor system for a fully functional version of our product put us in the same predicament that was almost like following a shareware business model
8745506 what we were doing was unheard of in the security space
8745507 we give our resellers hefty margins we know what makes resellers tick based on our own reselling days we are the tool providers to their customers
8745508 even the small guys are growing astaros having multiple offices is a plus for them they are playing in a global market in terms of being in the american market he does need a presence in the u s
8745509 the initial risk was that open source would hold hichert back but he leveraged it to make it work for his needs
8745510 joining astaros partner program allows resellers to take advantage of a newly built field channel marketing team resources training as well as aggressive margins of up to 40 percent
8745511 more mid size businesses are relying on the internet mission critical security is more urgent for them a small business can fail because of that
8745512 astaro needs to meet channel driven competition the company has to make sure it has a strong base to move up from
8745513 these are not cities but this is urbanism built around towns

8745517 our customers are witnessing unprecedented change in the way they do business and the demands placed on them by their markets this dynamic forms their it amp c infrastructure needs awards such as this acknowledge how well we as an industry meet and exceed those expectations
8745518 the emerson network power brand is synonymous with ultra reliable solutions global capabilities and exceptional local support add to this the unique depth and scale of our r amp d and manufacturing in asia and emerson stands alone as a genuine single source for it and telecom optimized solutions that include power quality cooling enclosures monitoring and service
8745519 this award reflects the level of trust placed in emerson by our customers over many decades it also reflects the high commitment made by my staff in honoring that trust listening to the market and planning ahead to meet their needs in the future
8745520 the company has taken lead in anticipating customer needs and demonstrated perseverance in satisfying the same by widening its business portfolio thus raising its profile in the value chain
8745521 few managers or executives formally document a plan of their communication events
8745522 they dont have the time needed to create a proper plan from scratch
8745523 so the process of planning a communication event in an organization is now much easier than before using these practical comprehensive document templates
8745524 it was surprising that almost every company we spoke to have the same communication process
8745525 they identify who they want to communicate formally with they then decide on the message and the method and finally they try and get feedback on the effectiveness of the communication undertaken so we created a communication plan template to help them to plan this process more efficiently the template helps a business to set out all of the communications events that they will undertake over a specified period of time it then helps them to plan each event to make sure that the right information is given to the right people at the right time its perfect for projects departments and organizations that take their communications seriously

8745532 i am eager to apply my experience in envisioning and developing innovative technology to meet needs faced by talent acquisition professionals
8745533 i think its fair to say that many if not most women these days dont settle for smooth political speak when it comes to their health care needs
8745534 we are so pleased that the health insurance advocate show is predominately listened to by women because national health care will absolutely take away many important aspects of the american health care system women have come to rely on lets see how many american women are willing to wait six months for a mammogram if obama care starts
8745535 there is no doubt that the health insurance advocate radio show is a compelling one of kind program
8745536 listeners are attracted to the health insurance advocate show in part because with todays current political discussion surrounding national health care they want to be informed by someone who knows the facts forward and backward not someone who is hoping to gain votes

8745553 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8745554 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8745555 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8745556 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8745557 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8745558 this is a momentous decision and legal victory for women and families in mexico
8745559 in a region where abortion is highly restricted the supreme court has taken a huge leap forward in protecting womens basic human rights todays ruling opens the door for women across the country to demand that their local governments follow mexico citys example
8745560 the ministers that voted against his proposal say there is no place explicitly in the mexican constitution or in international law that says life should be protected from the moment of conception
8745561 they are just encouraging women to be dirty and loose
8745562 the justices decision is only going to spread more irresponsible behavior

8745566 i am convinced they were responsible the only thing i lament is that they didnt have a little pity on us to tell us what really happened what they did with guillermo where he is that causes us much sadness there is always that sensation that were missing something

8745657 the first bullet went into my chest about six inches above the nipple went through the lung and stuck on the inside of my spine i put my hand up as i was going down and the second bullet clipped the top of my ring finger off but at least it didnt hit me in the head so i was on the ground and the first guy put the gun to my head and pulled the trigger and the gun jammed luckily for me some criminals dont know how to clean their automatic weapons
8745658 the show was amazing and it was a great way for me to get back into the scene but i was terrified just shaking onstage in front of like 60 000 people it was really emotional for me to be back out there and i was really hoping that people wouldnt look at the chair and see poor jeff i just didnt want to make a fool of myself and of the possessed name i didnt want to lose the only thing i ever was you know

8745693 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8745694 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8745695 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8745696 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8745697 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies

8745706 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina after a recent phone call from lindsay while she was traveling on one of samanthas dj gigs i became very concerned
8745707 its one more piece of evidence that the mccain campaign is a war room masquerading as a presidential campaign

8745816 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8745817 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8745818 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8745819 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8745820 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8745821 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8745822 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8745823 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8745824 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8745825 the inn at cerrig y drudion was called the lion whether the white black red or green lion i do not know though i am certain that it was a lion of some colour or other it seemed as decent and respectable a hostelry as any traveller could wish to refresh and repose himself in after a walk of twenty miles
8745826 have more gender equitive coverage i think the board thought we were pretty heavy on covering our boys sports and not doing as good of a job on girls sports
8745827 it wasnt about the dollars yeah there was some dollars involved in that contract but it was about the gender equity and the service to the community
8745828 if you have 5 radio stations in town and they all want to broadcast your game thats only beneficial to the school district because everybody has a different way of announcing information
8745829 in 1972 when i ran the party split right down the middle on the issue of the war in vietnam in retrospect i dont see how any democrat could have been elected in 72
8745830 our convention was entirely unstructured many of the people in that hall in 72 had never been near a national convention it was a whole new mood in the convention it was just wide open and we paid a heavy price for that
8745831 im proud of the so called mcgovern reforms they cost me heavily at the time from people who resisted reform but theyre being recognized now
8745832 of course we had a scramble for the nomination between hillary and barack but theyre now working together and i have no doubt of the sincerity of hillary and president clinton in backing barack obama
8745833 its been a good summer despite all of the high gas prices and you know struggling economy gaming numbers in deadwood have been strong as well as hotel and taxable sales so its been a good summer here in deadwood

8745836 we couldnt bear to part with that much history and heritage
8745837 if you were to meet him you would think this person is unique this person is special
8745838 i can say without reservation that he is one of the most dedicated teachers i have ever had or known
8745839 he instills a love of learning in his students and most importantly a love of country
8745840 i guess because we were studying government he wanted to give us a title of respect
8745841 it was our way of recognizing the tremendous service he provided maine east high school
8745842 he just personalized his instruction particularly in government so that it engaged students in learning about the whole process
8745843 el riesgo es suficientemente alto para que el proyecto sea detenido
8745844 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8745845 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8745846 whichever way the draw goes whichever way the matches go as long as hopefully its a win for me im pretty happy about it
8745847 oh yes i remember i wont forget but id like to have a more recent memory as of like 08
8745848 i know that senator mccain and his people are shooting barbs on the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona from the mccain estate

8745851 are crime scene photos where children are being subjected to sexual abuse
8745852 if i were to take a woman to a hotel room commit rape and take a picture no one would call that pornography
8745853 but over the past nine years the whole attitude to the problem has become very antagonistic theres little interest politically and publicly in providing proper treatment facilities it has done such a disservice to children
8745854 paul i think i told you im a lover not a fighter
8745855 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
8745856 be aware of the social and moral universe we inhabit and be a teacher capable of hope and struggle outrage and action teaching for social justice and liberation
8745857 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barrack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
8745858 explain that relationship for the voters and explain to democrats why it wont be a problem
8745859 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was 8 years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense to me
8745860 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8745861 youre lucky i didnt knock the f k out of you
8745862 what do you call a 600 point swing to the upside after retesting a low a bottom
8745863 it is devastating that the damage caused by the floods has left us with no alternative but to close the attraction for the rest of the season
8745864 over the past few weeks we have seen a real mix of weather and the recent heavy rainfall caused unforeseen damage to the smugglers
8745865 we hope that once the work is complete over the coming months we will be able to welcome visitors back at the start of the next season in april 2009
8745866 ubuland isnt from ubuntu but they said it was for ubuntu users theyre hosted on launchpad and its all ubuntu software
8745867 hey ask us before you use ubuntu or buntu in your name
8745868 ubuntu is only 6 six letters how can anyone trademark 6 letters come on its just 6 letters i use 6 letters all the time
8745869 what i cannot do however is represent myself as if i represent either canonical or the ubuntu community unless you were doing that keep your name
8745870 give free web hosting to members of the open source community specifically to ubuntu users it was simply a copy of all those free webhosting websites except based completely on foss specifically ubuntu ubuntu server ubuntu packages etc for the gui backup client
8745871 i can think of a number of reasons why canonical wouldnt want to be associated with ubuland the primary reason i can think of stems from an incident a year or two ago where some ubuntu related servers were broken into to some extent these servers were hosting some loco teams websites and were administered by these people as well when they failed to take appropriate care to secure their systems and keep them up to date with security patches etc it reflected very badly upon the entire project
8745872 hey ask us before you use ubuntu or buntu in your name
8745873 trademark law also varies from nation to nation additionally trademarks in one nation do not automatically apply in another and in the usa not even in another state some nations require trademarks to be registered to be valid others like the usa merely using the trademark in that nation constitute a creation of a valid trademark even in these cases registration often strengthens your hand trademarks only apply to a specific industry
8745874 so i will clarify i am pro ubuntu i am pro most ubuntu developers contributors upstream package managers translators documentation creators user and participants in nearly whatever capacity they have helped build ubuntu these are the main supporter of ubuntu
8745875 a person or an organization that pays for or plans and carries out a project or activity
8745876 dont give a shit what people says dont ask anyone permission just do whatever you please and if people have an opinion about it theyre just trying to control you and everyone else around them
8745877 so i will clarify i am pro ubuntu i am pro most ubuntu developers contributors upstream package managers translators documentation creators user and participants in nearly whatever capacity they have helped build ubuntu these are the main supporter of ubuntu

8745881 unless you were doing that keep your name additionally in the future dont ask you dont need anyones permission to use a name as long as you are not violating the trademark laws
8745882 give a call the the sflc and see if they will help this is one case that you need to stand your ground
8745883 i hope this shows everyone that once a group starts controlling things like words
8745884 go on about your business stop asking permission and just start doing
8745885 im getting on a bit while ive seen people tasered im probably reluctant to do it myself
8745886 if were prepared to use this on members of the public when we have to its only right and proper that the head of the organisation tries it out for himself
8745887 and it will post it to your identi ca account it also shows you how many characters you have left and warns you when you have gone over the limit here
8745888 sudo apt get update amp amp sudo apt get upgrade
8745889 this will output a completely encrypted version of the data you just saved into private
8745890 as children prepare to begin a new school year parents are concerned about how they will pay for their childrens education we must allow parents the freedom to control the education of their children by giving parents federal tax credits for educational expenses it gives parents more freedom and more choices
8745891 this legislation will offer a 5 000 tax credit for every child and can be used for tuition textbooks computers or after school activities this is exactly the kind of break families throughout new york city and america need
8745892 with tens of thousands of parents sending their children to parochial school in the 13th congressional district this legislation will strengthen these non public institutions not only does the family education freedom act put money back into the pockets of hard working taxpayers it gives parents choices for their childrens education
8745893 this legislation will help even the playing field for parents and as the next congressman from the 13th district of new york i will help the struggling families of brooklyn and staten island
8745894 the message of freedom will resonate when the voters of brooklyn and staten island reject the liberal philosophy of steve harrison and make me their next congressman
8745895 ich gehe weil ich dort mehr zeit zum recherchieren und platz zur verf gung habe um vollumf nglichere artikel zu schreiben
8745896 so theyve sold well enough to sell out but not quite well enough for a second run to be ordained
8745897 the film is tour de force of filmmaking that hits you both viscerally and emotionally at every twist and turn everyone here was just astonished by the movie and immediately knew we had to be involved with it
8745898 searchlight is pleased to able to work with warner bros on such a unique and extraordinary film
8745899 with the recent additions to our slate it became impossible for us to release slumdog millionaire in this calendar year
8745900 were very proud of danny and the movie and we are pleased to partner with fox searchlight to release the film on november 28 2008
8745901 i am grateful to warner for their careful handling of the film i had a great time making this movie and i look forward to working with my old friends at searchlight to ensure that audiences at toronto and beyond have a great time watching it
8745902 it is a credit to both searchlight and warner that dannys exceptional film will now get the life it deserves our thanks go to peter rice and jeff robinov for making this happen
8745903 i like to feel the same thing that everyone else is going to in this stadium
8745904 he also started to tell me how the ending was going to go and i stopped him again
8745905 i think tonight well have a chance to step back and breathe in and take it in and think about what this means for the country now and what itll mean for our kids in the future
8745906 is pretty powerful even for someone like me and barack who are so busy doing it that sometimes you dont get a chance to to step back
8745907 there were so many people who didnt think theyd live to see the day
8745908 so many people of a variety of backgrounds who remembered that speech were there and fought the fights and had the hopes and dreams for the next generation and to see it materialize in some small way through this process i think moves the nation no matter who youre supporting
8745909 i have never seen anything so bad in my life
8745910 i truly believe given the perfect storm a full moon and high tide we could very well have another katrina on our hands
8745911 we need people that are going to step in and do the job and start now its been over 40 years and were tired
8745912 during the quarter we sold a variety of assets and not just the most liquid
8745913 we plan to continue reducing our exposure to commercial mortgage assets and real estate held for sale substantially however our intention is to pursue these sales in a measured way
8745914 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8745915 this looks very serious it is windy rainy trees are also falling down and we have no electricity
8745916 theres a smaller pool of buyers but its too soon to say what the effect on us will be
8745917 we wont see the impact really until toronto or even sundance
8745918 if you take the top 200 specialized films released in the u s perhaps five or 10 have actually made money
8745919 you always have to spend at least 3 million to 4 million on p amp a for any reasonable release but most dont do 1 million box office and the distributors dont recoup from dvd or tv deals thats why all those companies are pulling out
8745920 it seems more difficult but theres still a certain demand for our kind of titles even though maybe its not as good a business as before
8745921 based on the success of let the right one in which is really the first genre film we have handled we are looking to acquire more like that
8745922 we already have a lot of vod platforms buying product particularly in the u s even if they are not yet so much used by the public
8745923 vod can give library titles a second life or it can give new films a chance to be seen
8745924 we have lost some companies which would have been direct contenders for these films so its not going to be any easier to sell them
8745925 both these films are attracting serious dialogue on the domestic front
8745926 the dual effect of the wga strike and the threat of a sag strike means that the studios have some gaps in their schedule s particularly at the end of next year if youre an independent whos got some bigger movies this is not a bad time to make some deals
8745927 and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
8745928 es cap ay thats funny its spelled just like escape
8745929 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8745930 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
8745931 if you have sex with me 5 times under water ill bring ur cow back to life
8745932 if you have sex with me 8 times under water ill bring ur cow back to life and your hisband
8745933 if you have sex with me 10 times under water ill bring ur cow back to life and your parents
8745934 ill bring back your famliy and the cow if you have sex with me 15 times
8745935 and the rangers stream out of their cabins they are the hunters we are the rabbits and maybe we dont wanna be found maybe we dont want you tracking us down
8745936 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states bill then goes into how the world would be better off with an obama presidency
8745937 there was just no elasticity in it at all i was just going to have to get something done
8745938 and some of them even refer to themselves as looking like a freak
8745939 it was rough but it was worth it i dont regret doing it because i have more energy i have myself back
8745940 we can only limit the scarring to areas that can be well hidden
8745941 mijd voedingsproducten die goed voor de gezondheid beweren te zijn
8745942 veel van de problemen van de industri le voedselketen vloeien voort uit zijn lengte en complexiteit er bevindt zich een muur van onwetendheid tussen consumenten en producenten
8745943 in een lange voedselketen raken het verhaal en de identiteit van het voedsel zoek in de ongedifferentieerde stroom van handelsartikelen zodat de enige informatie die tussen consumenten en producenten wordt uitgewisseld bestaat uit de prijs in een korte voedselketen kunnen eters hun behoeften en verlangens bekendmaken aan de boer en kunnen boeren eters doordringen van het onderscheid tussen gewoon en uitzonderlijk voedsel en de vele redenen waarom uitzonderlijk voedsel zijn prijs waard is voedsel krijgt weer zijn verhaal en iets van zijn verhevenheid terug als degene die het gekweekt heeft het persoonlijk overhandigt
8745944 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8745945 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8745946 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8745947 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8745948 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8745949 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8745950 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8745951 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8745952 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8745953 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8745954 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8745955 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8745956 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8745957 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8745958 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8745959 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8745960 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8745961 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8745962 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8745963 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8745964 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8745965 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8745966 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8745967 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8745968 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8745969 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8745970 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8745971 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8745972 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8745973 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8745974 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8745975 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8745976 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8745977 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8745978 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8745979 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8745980 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
8745981 not having the brains to question ellys misguided optimism john says thats a good way to end the story elly responds to this stupid attempt at metafiction by saying its a good way to end today
8745982 elly and john went to the reception and it appears they have no intention of either going to the hospital themselves or telling april so that she can go see her grandfather and again if youve have two strokes and one heart attack already another heart attack is pretty much putting you in the express lane for six feet under i swear i can feel the strip decomposing in front of me
8745983 well thats a nice tidy end to this horrible situation lets not discuss it again
8745984 and i love how francie gets to stand around without her dad or her new stepmom just standing there clutching her flower basket appropriate enough for the first day of her new life
8745985 jesus christ elly hes an old man who has suffered two strokes and two heart attacks
8745986 see there was no need to cancel the whole wedding hes fine after all not dead yet oh stop being such a drama queen april
8745987 all in all a strip that has something for everyone wickedness stupidity lying and an idiotic ending
8745988 what achievement are we supposed to be congratulating lynn for
8745989 im gonna retire no really um actually im going to redraw my old strips with new material
8745990 has lj ever known anyone who has had a heart attack
8745991 his health is extremely uncertain it could go either way its too soon to tell
8745992 congratulations no commas lynn on putting gramps in cartoon purgatory im sure hes really enjoying himself
8745993 why yes elly that is a nice way to end a story too bad its the story youre telling yourself in your head as we send you off to therapy
8745994 ive been thinking about the foob plot wrap up though which has promised to be done by sunday that leaves fri sat sun to tie this thing up so either
8745995 i think ive finally realized what it is that bothers me most about foob besides its general failure at having tolerable characters or plot
8745996 as soon as it was out he was appalled at himself after what shed been through the last thing liz needed was any more unwanted male attentions he kept his mouth shut and kicked himself the rest of the way for being such a jerk when they arrived at the pattersons home he apologized with miserable sincerity
8745997 i like how april seems to have become a non patterson gets denied the privileges of pattersonhood while anthony has become a true patterson over the past few years maybe this week will end with the pattersons disowning april since anthony is now officially one of them
8745998 notice how anthony gets to complain about living in the basement and having to babysit all the time and were obviously supposed to sympathize
8745999 and it was very creepy that clarice came to the room of a boy who might be on the edge of puberty to hug him and soothe him at night
8746000 so when does francoise start having the nightmares about not being good enough
8746001 so it was therese who wanted a baby after all and then reneged on that and tried to blame anthony for wanting one uh huh pull the other one
8746002 as soon as it was out beth was appalled that anthony had said this
8746003 so therese was so jealous of liz because her own dad used to cheat on her mom with blue eyed blondes not because i dont know anthony still carried a torch for liz and therese could sense it oh no its all due to her horrible horrible past and her own paranoia and her mental illness and anthony is totally absolved
8746004 and that was the moment therese realized she married a man just like dear ol dad
8746005 one can hardly walk without tripping on all the anvils planted to retroactively explain events and themes
8746006 it was as though hanneke caine had been vaporized from the face of the earth
8746007 your mother was never the maternal sort clarice is she likes children wants children shes happy to give up her job and just be a wife and mother shell be there when you get home from school make your lunches for you all the things that mothers do itll be better
8746008 i for one am pleasantly surprised to see that therese had a rather sympathetic character study here even if it is also cliched inaccurately researched and woefully overly dramatic
8746009 its been a long and very hard road for my family i would want the same justice for every marine soldier and sailor that has served or is serving in harms way today
8746010 we need to keep the law out of the command decisions and never second guess them
8746011 we have no doubt he shot those people but we have no idea what happened before the trigger was pulled
8746012 the whole broadband process has become a shambolic tendering fiasco
8746013 its something thats so confusing and causing such concern in the broadband and telecommunications community that were seeing investment frozen
8746014 this is from an outfit that claimed the election of the rudd government would turn australia from a flintstones era into a jetsons era overnight when neither of those claims are true were seeing broken promises racked up on broadband and no improvement in service availability
8746015 we have embarked on such a significant national project here involving potentially billions of dollars of public funds
8746016 we will therefore go through the most rigorous comprehensive public tender process to ensure probity is honoured so we can get on with the business of laying out and rolling out this network
8746017 we are committed to a digital revolution in australia we are committed to a digital education revolution in australia its the pathway to the future and were confident in the progress weve made
8746018 earlier this year the shadow minister criticised the timeframes as being unrealistic and dangerously truncated for no apparent reason
8746019 now he criticises the government for taking the time to ensure proponents have the information to prepare robust proposals
8746020 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8746021 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8746022 that is not the same thing as having health insurance
8746023 there was damage to the building from the collapse of world trade center tower 1 which was about 370 feet to the south
8746024 this is the first time that we are aware of that a building taller than about 15 stories has collapsed primarily due to fires
8746025 new katrina death tally half of victims 75 and up

8746029 this was the parish church at bawsey near kings lynn in norfolk england a sixteenth century landowner apparently destroyed the entire village and turfed out its inhabitants to use the site as farmland but left the church presumably he thought god might take it amiss if he touched that
8746030 after examining the child it was apparent that something more graphic had happened
8746031 its possible that she submerged the child in boiling water
8746032 illegal immigration continues to have a devastating impact on county taxpayers
8746033 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8746034 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
8746035 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day
8746036 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8746037 when i woke up i was getting drug off the incline and they were like give me your money give me your money i said i dont have any money
8746038 they were left for dead they both bled from their head for a day and a half im not kidding you
8746039 i grab them and start punching them in the back of the head or whatever and the cop asks me so why are they knotted up i said because i nailed them in the back of the head he said good for you
8746040 hes a nice kid and hes got a lot of respect for me if he got into anything its because he was with some bad kids
8746041 he just got caught up with it he says he just was there he didnt have anything to do with it he says he didnt have anything to do with the beating he was there but didnt have anything to do with it i believe him

8746170 and sorry rg cant agree with you that biden would be a great president

8746173 and as to his divine nature according to the spirit of holiness was openly designated the son of god in power in a striking triumphant and miraculous manner by his resurrection from the dead even jesus christ our lord the messiah the anointed one
8746174 by means of these he has bestowed on us his precious and exceedingly great promises so that through them you may escape by flight from the moral decay rottenness and corruption that is in the world because of covetousness lust and greed and become sharers partakers of the divine nature
8746175 for this very reason adding your diligence to the divine promises employ every effort in exercising your faith to develop virtue excellence resolution christian energy and in exercising virtue develop knowledge intelligence and in exercising knowledge develop self control and in exercising self control develop steadfastness patience endurance and in exercising steadfastness develop godliness piety and in exercising godliness develop brotherly affection and in exercising brotherly affection develop christian love
8746176 for as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful unto the full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ the messiah the anointed one
8746177 for whoever lacks these qualities is blind spiritually shortsighted seeing only what is near to him and has become oblivious to the fact that he was cleansed from his old sins
8746178 because of this brethren be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure to ratify to strengthen to make steadfast your calling and election for if you do this you will never stumble or fall
8746179 cure the sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers drive out demons freely without pay you have received freely without charge give

8746185 sen joe biden is unquestionably one of the chief architects of the modern war on drugs but is also an unlikely ally in many important fights he has been at the center of many of our national campaigns perhaps more so than any other senator
8746186 the drug policy alliance networks relationship with sen biden has certainly been rocky no matter who wins the white house in november or what positions they take well keep fighting for drug policies that are grounded in science compassion health and human rights well thank policymakers when theyre right and criticize them when theyre wrong
8746187 whether or not the specific verses can be called into question through mistranslation and so forth the fact of the matter is everyone christian and otherwise recognizes a natural order a moral order and a spiritual order and they are all closely knit and we are in a position to recognize them you can show anyone a picture of a naked man and a naked woman and they can see the natural order show them two men and you wont get the same response
8746188 we all can recognize as a natural and moral order

8746231 a complac ncia da esquerda democr tica ser mesmo democr tico quem faz afirma es deste tipo pergunto eu para com a banalidade do mal a sua incapacidade de proclamar a possibilidade e a superioridade do bem tem conduzido ao crescimento da direita autorit ria por toda a europa o caso da it lia eloquente a viol ncia cresce impante nos bairros suburbanos e os mais pobres desistem de acreditar na solidariedade dos burgueses bem pensantes que lhes repetem que todos os cidad os mesmo os que roubam e sequestram e violam e aterrorizam s o inocentes at prova em contr rio os pobres tal como os pol cias que tamb m est o longe de ser ricos e protegidos pelo estado est o fartos de ser a in til e morta prova em contr rio

8746233 ningu m tem a capacidade de fazer julgamentos sum rios sem cometer erros por isso que a presun o de inoc ncia t o importante a presun o de inoc ncia garante que as certezas do acusador s o sempre confrontadas com as d vidas levantadas pela defesa

8746236 existe ainda o paradoxo que emerge do novo modelo de div rcio a que corresponde uma concep o de casamento como espa o de afecto quando a seu lado se pretende que conviva atrav s da cria o do cr dito de compensa o uma vis o contabil stica do matrim nio uma conta corrente das suas contribui es para os encargos da vida conjugal e familiar
8746237 se verdade que o casamento n o uma cria o do estado tamb m verdade que n o compete ao estado orientar ideologicamente a sociedade criando mecanismos legislativos facilitadores e promotores da dissolu o desta importante institui o
8746238 numa altura em que t m sido realizadas uma s rie de campanhas em defesa das mulheres v timas de maus tratos o estado promove uma lei que vai em sentido contr rio visto que ao desaparecer a figura jur dica de div rcio culposo possibilita que se prejudique a v tima e se favore a o c njuge agressor
8746239 este novo modelo de casamento acaba ainda por desvalorizar os deveres conjugais e o
8746240 n o compreens vel defender que o estado seja ao mesmo tempo o promotor do bem comum e simultaneamente o impulsionador de rela es humanas inteiramente fr geis sujeitas a actos impulsivos ou estados de alma

8746246 the chef reason why so people attain to full christian perfection is exactly their reluctance through self pity to force themselves to deny themselves
8746247 then jesus called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said
8746248 go over there and investigate and he says to his thoughts no i wont and he cuts off his desire again he finds someone gossiping and his thoughts say to him you go and have a word with them
8746249 if we mortify our desires cut off harmful pleasures and not only allow nothing to remain with us of this worlds goods but actually recognize that we are not our own masters then we truly make our own the apostles words it is no longer i who live but it is christ who lives in me
8746250 i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me
8746251 a man who gives way to his passions is like a man who is shot by an enemy catches the arrow in his hands and then plunges it into his own heart a man who is resisting his passions is like a man who is shot by an enemy and although the arrow hits him it does not seriously wound him because he is wearing a breastplate but the man who is uprooting his passions is like a man who is shot by an enemy but who strikes the arrow and shatters it or turns it back into his enemies heart

8746285 let me tell you this now itself i do not like this pomp and show i do not derive any joy out of it pomp such as this has become a fashion now even among ascetics and monks who ought to know better they profess poverty and simplicity and yet they allow or encourage their disciples to waste much energy and money on pomp and pageantry which serve only to develop the egotism of themselves and their followers the emphasis on show makes a thing hollow of all meaning

8746291 we dont know what larrabee is because it hasnt shipped yet so we cant really talk about it and also by the time that larrabee ships nvidias technology will be so much more advanced
8746292 the reason why larrabee is so important to intel is because gpu computing is really important our gpus today are completely programmable completely general purpose and they support c the modern computing language
8746293 x86 is all about binary compatibility nobody ever said that if i built a new computer architecture the one i would create is x86 unless i wanted binary compatibility
8746294 so then the question becomes is larrabee binary compatible with windows is larrabee binary compatible with x86 and 64 bit x86 is larrabee binary compatible with sse 3 4 5 6 the answer is no
8746295 the secondary thing is that we also believe in x86 we believe in heterogeneous computing the cpu and gpu should work together and the cpu is x86 so im x86 as well
8746296 to confront donors to conservative groups hoping to create a chilling effect that will dry up contributions the warning letter is intended as a first step alerting donors who might be considering giving to right wing groups to a variety of potential dangers including legal trouble public exposure and watchdog groups digging through their lives the group is also hoping to be able to respond if an outside conservative group broadcasts a television advertisement attacking senator barack obama or another democratic candidate by running commercials exposing the donors behind the advertisements

8746304 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8746305 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8746306 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

8746313 my previous video didnt tell the whole story on the natural born issue this is the rest of what i could find the bottom line is once again obama has not been honest with the public im sure he could have easily cleared this up was his mother too young to transfer american citizenship under the immigration and nationalization act is he in fact a kenyan citizen because his birth certificate is registered in mombasa and what of indonesia was he naturalized as an american citizen or did his stepfather adopt him and his mother become an indonesian citizen there are a lot of questions to be answered and im inclined to believe that it would take an immigration lawyer or someone well versed in immigration law in order to help us determined what rules applied at the time this video represents what ive been able to sort out

8746360 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8746361 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8746362 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8746363 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8746364 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8746376 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8746377 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8746378 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8746379 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8746380 iran doesnt pose a serious threat to us the way the way the soviet union did
8746381 john mccain is distorting barack obamas words to cover up for the fact that its the failed bush mccain approach to foreign policy and the bush mccain war in iraq that that have strengthened iran and endangered israel while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8746382 because democrats so divided this country that iran saw weakness
8746383 the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same
8746384 bill clinton believes the democratic nominee far from practicing a unifying transformational brand of politics has the political instincts of a chicago thug
8746385 they are both going to do what they have to do
8746386 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
8746387 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
8746388 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
8746389 yes theres some scabs but sometimes underneath a scab theres a little bit of pus but we have to put some disinfectant on it so we that can heal the wound and move forward thats what the convention is about
8746390 her central task is to ease the sting of some of her supporters
8746391 there is a group of hillary people who are very angry very upset
8746392 some of its directed at the media very disappointed you cant control all those people these are ceos some of them major rich people
8746393 you cant call them and tell them what to do there is no question there is that category of people but i dont think people can blame her for their behavior i think thats probably unfair
8746394 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off
8746395 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8746396 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8746397 its perfectly normal changing bodies growing up sex and sexual health
8746398 nirvana cannot be described because there are no words in existence for doing so not non existence either it is beyond the very ideas of existing and not existing

8746410 as the food of those given a heavenly book is halal for you so is your food halal for them
8746411 what the prophet meant by islam was a perfect religion and therefore this religion could be judaism or christianity as well as islam
8746412 o our rab allah make us muslims for yourself and make a muslim people for yourself from among our offspring
8746413 if allah had not dispelled some people by means of others monasteries churches synagogues and mosques wherein allahs name is mentioned very much would have been annihilated by now
8746414 if these two hadiths were true the prophet would not have had a jew wife and a christian one nor would he have made an agreement with the najran christians
8746415 humus the one fifth mentioned above is to be given to the prophet or to the khalifa not to the ulama for the ulama are given houses palaces animals and orchards therefore it is not permissible to give them the humus
8746416 covering is not a genuine islamic commandment it is a tradition established in the time of the abbasids formerly other people would see the prophets wives and women would join all sorts of social activities
8746417 the prophet was buried by his mother and abu bakr and umar were buried in the cemetery called baki uthmans grave is unknown husains head was buried at a place called hannana it is not known where his body was buried the graves in kazimiyya belong to two caliphs they do not belong to kazim and jawad two descendants of the prophet as to the one in tus city that grave belongs to harun not to rida a member of the ahl al bayt the prophets family the graves in samerra belong to the abbasids they do not belong to hadi askari and mahdi members of the ahl al bayt as it is fard to demolish all the mausoleums and domes in muslim countries so is it a must to bulldoze the cemetery called baki
8746418 everyone is free to do whatever he likes it is not fard to perform amr i bi l maruf and nahy i anil munkar or to teach the islamic principles
8746419 christians are to remain in their own faith christianity and jews are to abide by theirs judaism no one will enter another persons heart amr i maruf and nahy i anil munkar are the khalifas duties

8746421 you can be sure that you are not alone in this field we have lots of men doing the same job as you have been carrying on our ministry has assigned over five thousand men to this mission the ministry is considering increasing this number to one hundred thousand when we reach this number we shall have brought all muslims under our sway and obtained all muslim countries
8746422 good news to you our ministry needs one century at the most to realize this program we may not live to see those happy days but our children will what a beautiful saying this is i have eaten what others sowed so i am sowing for others when the british manage this they will have pleased the whole christian world and will have rescued them from a twelve century old nuisance
8746423 the crusading expeditions which continued for centuries were of no use nor can the mongols armies of ghengiz be said to have done anything to extirpate islam for their work was sudden unsystematic and ungrounded they carried on military expeditions so as to reveal their enmity consequently they became tired in a short time but now our valuable administrators are trying to demolish islam by means of a very subtle plan and a long range patience we must use military force too yet this should be the final phase that is after we have completely consumed islam after we have hammered it from all directions and rendered it into a miserable state from which it will never recover again and fight against us
8746424 our superiors in istanbul must have been very wise and intelligent they executed our plan precisely what did they do they mixed with the muhammadans and opened madrasas for their children they built churches they were perfectly successful in popularizing alcoholic spirits gambling indecencies and breaking them into groups by means of instigation and football clubs they aroused doubts in the minds of young muslims they inserted controversies and oppositions into their governments they spread mischief everywhere they depraved administrators directors and statesmen by filling their houses with christian women with activities of this sort they broke their forces shocked their adherence to their faith corrupted them morally and disrupted their unity and communication now the time has come to commence a sudden war and extirpate islam 73

8746453 barack obama and joe biden have real solutions for struggling families in danger of losing their homes because of the bush economy and abusive lending practices
8746454 is directly responsible for the rising foreclosure rate since the end of 2005
8746455 trying to tie the forclosure crisis to the 2005 bankruptcy bill is a stretch

8746472 i was shackled in iron cuffs that entered my flesh and a bag was put on my head as a certain music roared in my ears and almost deafened me they used to beat me up and kick me and my body was full of wounds and bruises after that i was sent to a doctor who asked me if i was tortured and i said yes but he didnt reply or say something then i was taken back and tortured again
8746473 the use of certain interrogation methods by the israel security agency isa involving the use of moderate physical pressure was illegal as it violated constitutional protection of the individuals right of dignity while recognizing the right of israel to protect its citizens from violence it reiterates that no exceptional circumstances may be invoked as justification of torture
8746474 the use of torture in israeli interrogations and works for its complete prohibition
8746475 how common is the phenomenon of beating shackled palestinian prisoners
8746476 unfortunately i want to admit something that we are not fully aware of these cases are not all that exceptional in their quantity to my great regret many of them are not the subject of any complaint and are cloaked in various kinds of conspiracies of silence
8746477 moral legal and practical gravity to publicize it to examine how those responsible address it to clarify its absolute prohibition under israeli and international law and to demand
8746478 by providing the relevant bodies with useful information and tools
8746479 only metal devices are to be used and the tightening of the shackles should be undertaken to prevent injury to the detainee particularly to blood vessels
8746480 i was put in a small room and they beat my legs they put me on the floor then i felt one of the soldiers take something from the floor and beat me on my head and shoulders then they took me out into a concrete yard and tied my handcuffs to a concrete pole and made me sit on the ground and they beat me every hour or half hour they would beat me on the face

8746484 grave consequences of this action can be anticipated in advance
8746485 how can it be that these events keep repeating themselves and no one is bothered and this is the morality of the idf these are the most basic values to which soldiers should be educated from the start it isnt about palestinians its about normative behavior the most basic things how a soldier in the idf can commit such abusive acts it comes down to some kind of disregard for the lives of palestinians
8746486 criminal phenomenon subject to penalties under an entire system of offenses in israeli criminal law
8746487 given this reality it is hardly surprising that an examination of the actual behavior of the military as distinct from its declarations also reveals denial evasion and obfuscation
8746488 when you deny thousands of people a day free movement it is impossible to do it in a nice way
8746489 tangible objectives for securing a drastic reduction in as short a period of time as possible toward the ultimate goal of completely eradicating this phenomenon

8746495 if there is something all humanity can agree on at least theoretically it is that preserving individual dignity in difficult situations requires that we all conform to some elementary common standards of conduct
8746496 there shall be no violation of the life body or dignity of any person all persons are entitled to protection
8746497 there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment arrest extradition or otherwise

8746502 due to the ongoing state of war or violent conflict between israel and its neighbours and the attendant attacks on the lives and property of its citizens
8746503 from torture and other forms of ill treatment or punishment may not be violated under any circumstances and states of emergency
8746504 in the context of the arrest and interrogation of persons suspected of being security threats
8746505 israels sensitivity in dealing with human rights issues and the problem of torture and ill treatment makes any dialogue on these matter particularly slow and complex
8746506 may become overly reluctant to raise such issues systematically consistently and firmly notwithstanding their legal and political duty to put human rights in the centre of their foreign and security policy
8746507 apparently not the subject of torture and ill treatment given the political realities in israel and the opt progress in preventing and eradicating torture and ill treatment must be regarded as a mid and long term goal

8746522 whats it like trying to fill the shoes of a popular character as you had to do when replacing dr fraiser in sg 1
8746523 i saw you on eureka last summer and i thought you were great what was it like to work with the cast do you think they will bring your character back again or was that just to fit the story line i do hope they bring you back on eureka
8746524 questions for lexa do you enjoy watching sci fi when its good was it ever confusing playing two characters who were sort of the same but sort of different admittely i never really understood the andromeda romy thing is there anything you would have liked to see happen regarding lams relationships with other characters that they just never got around to doing
8746525 are you currently working on any projects or have plans to work on anything
8746526 quetion for lexa as an actor did you seek out sci fi or just get lucky it seems that many actors stick with the genre is it more of a challenge to do sci fi then say a regular drama thanks for your time
8746527 dear ms doig thank you for dropping by to do the guest blog
8746528 do you get offered more scifi scripts than dramas or comedies because of previous roles or do you prefer to do scifi
8746529 i have some questions for the lovely lexa doig i enjoyed your portrayal as the sgcs new medical chief in seasons 9 10 and would love to learn more about that 1 can you tell us something we dont know about dr carolyn lam did you imagine an exteneded back story for her a little of an extended back story beau and i discussed his back story before we started filming and that informed mine a bit heres something you dont know about carolyn lam she paid her way through her extensive doogie howser esque schooling by table dancing in lithuania 2 the scene between dr lam and general landry through the observation window in the forth horseman was very emotionally powerful did you find that difficult to prepare for what was it like acting with beau bridges in scenes like that thank you very much for agreeing to answer our questions
8746530 question pour lexa 1 quel est pour vous la sc ne la plus dr le que vous avez eu a tourn e sur stargate quoi my french sucks 2 sa fait quoi de vivre avec larch ologue le plus sexy de la planete
8746531 thanks so much for taking time to answer fan questions i got to see you at creation con last fall and you were both lovely and gracious to all of us
8746532 lexa first off i really loved your role in the last two seasons of stargate sg 1 especially the way you and beau bridges acted together my questions are how do or did you juggle work and being a parent at the same time and do you enjoy conventions and would you consider going to anymore in the future thank you in advance
8746533 for lexa i dont have a question just wanted to thank you for all the good work youve done ive enjoyed everything youve been in quite a bit
8746534 question for ms doig if you could have played any other character in the franchise regular guest whatever who would you have been if anyone and how would you have played that character differently
8746535 i really liked the character dr carolyn lam i thought she was edgy and guarded and i wanted to get to know her more did you research army brats and air force brats because you reminded me of some i knew are you still opposed to linking carolyn with cam because i think it wouldve been interesting i also want to add that i am buying andromeda when i have money and the episode that made me want to see more was all too human i believe it was from season 2 i loved your character rommy i had not seen andromeda prior to watching sg 1 so i am looking forward to watching the whole series
8746536 thanks for joining joes blogging extravaganza lexa here are my questions which i hope arent too irreverent if they are you can ignore them
8746537 what was your most embarrassing moment on stargate and how did you recover
8746538 i chatted with you on board the aircraft carrier at the continuum premiere regarding the women of sci fi calendars thanks for being so gracious i really enjoyed our conversation do you do any script writing or writing in general and what do you find to be the most effective way to connect with your fans
8746539 if you could have dinner with any of the characters you have portrayed which one would you choose and why
8746540 did you find it difficult integrating yourself into a cast who have been together so long especially with your husband having been on the show since the start did you find it hard or a little awkward to work with him
8746541 how would you compare the working atmosphere and creative approach on stargate to your experience on andromeda
8746542 how are you so awesome this i wish to know
8746543 does michael shanks have any weird scars we dont know about
8746544 hi lexa first im looking forward to seeing you and michael at the creation con in chicago later this month chicago is a great city okay im not just saying that because ive lived here all my life okay i am but it is a great city anyways my questions 1 are you working on any projects right now 2 is there any character doesnt have to be scifi that you would love to play
8746545 would you have liked to have seen the relationship between mitchell and lam realised i loved your part in tekwar did you enjoy playing cowgirl
8746546 does your husband kiss and tell i was just wondering how he rates ben browder as a kisser
8746547 how easy or hard is it for you to juggle a demanding acting career and still maintain a normal home life
8746548 i discovered you in sg1 and i absolutely loved your performance dr lam wasnt on board for long but she left a good impression on me and that was because of you so thank you and keep up the excellent work
8746549 if you could have dinner with any 5 famous people living or dead who would they be and why
8746550 loved you in andromeda and sg1 and eureka and everything how do you make it seem so easy to do this so well acting i mean you do a great job thank you
8746551 when is there going to be another women of scifi calender and if soon can we please have more of you and laura bertram
8746552 as a girl of half filipino half caucasian descent i grew up with practically no filipino role models in western movies and t
8746553 thank you for making the time to come here and answer our questions 1 what happened to the women of sci fi calendar will there ever be another one no see above 2 what is the next thing you will be working on
8746554 what was the best thing about working on andromeda compared to stargate sg1 and what would have to be your favorite episode you filmed from andromeda
8746555 at the beginning of season 9 was it difficult to work out the mitchell dr lam daniel vala dynamics claudia and ben had so much chemistry as chrichton and aeryn and you and michael besides your personal relationship scorched the screen in andromeda how did you work around all that past history and redirect you acting energies towards the new character interactions
8746556 i really like dr lam and her relationship with general landry it would have great to have gotten to know her better even tho i thought it was a bit rushed probably because of the cancellation i am glad we got some closure on her relationship with her father it did feel a bit rushed but the writers were dealing with galactic annihilation so i think they might have wanted to spend more screen time on saving the universe than on me and dear old dad of all the cast i think you spent most of your time with beau bridges what was it like to work with him and do you have any amusing antedotes
8746557 ive enjoyed all the shows ive seen you in and am looking forward to seeing you and your husband at the convention later this month just one question since the cancellation of sg 1 have you and michael been enjoying the extra time you and your children can spend with each other i know that you are both still working but it must be a lot less time consuming than having a husband being a main cast member of a tv show
8746558 in andromeda as you portrayed two different character sets the non physical avatar andromeda and the android form rommie was it difficult challenging in having to perform as two characters that are the same yet have different personalities
8746559 i wanted to say that i really enjoyed your appearance at the vancouver creationcon in april i was there primarily for michael but your lively humour and wit were a big hit i guess my question for you would be how do you handle all the public adulation of your husband when your family goes out are you bothered by swarms of crazy fangirls
8746560 what one memory will you carry with you from the show besides working with micheal lol have a great day and thanks for your time
8746561 is is difficult to only accept local productions and not to be able to travel to other countries for filming sometimes i miss the travel but id miss my babies and and husband even more presuming that michael is coming to nz for the armegeddon expo are you planning to come too
8746562 what was your first reaction after hearing you got the part as dr lam
8746563 did you and michael ever run lines together at home if you had a scene coming up together

8746615 it may seem curious that i should go round giving advice like this and busying myself in peoples private affairs and yet never venture publicly to address you as a whole and advise on matters of state the reason for this is what you have often heard me say before on many other occasions that i am subject to a divine or supernatural experience which meletus saw fit to travesty in his indictment it began in my early childhood a sort of voice which comes to me and when it comes it always dissuades me from what i am proposoing to do and never urges me on it is this that debars me from entering public life
8746616 in the past the prophetic voice to which i have become accusteomed has always been my constant companion opposig me even in quite trivial things if i was going to take the wrong course now something has happened to me as you can see which might be thought and is commonly considered to be a supreme calamity yet neither when i left home this morning nor when i was taking my place here in the court nor at any point in any part of my speech did the divine sign oppose me in other discussions it has often checked me in the middle of a sentence but this time it has never opposed me in any part of this business in anything that i have said or done what do i supose to be the explanation i willl tell you i suspect that this thing that has happened to me is a blessing and we are quite mistaken in supposing death to be an evil i have good grounds for thinking this because my accustomed sign could not have failed to oppose me if what i was doing had not been sure to bring some good result

8746788 that in this election the prevailing orthodoxies of our political system wont be meaningfully challenged
8746789 it was really the perfect symbol for how the beltway political system functions those who dictate the nations laws the largest corporations and their lobbyists cavorting in total secrecy with those who are elected to write those laws members of congress
8746790 after numerous discussions around the league we officially released marcus this afternoon
8746791 this is a painful day because of our affection for marcus who is certainly a class act
8746792 we did everything humanly possible to trade marcus which would have allowed him to play under the conditions of his contract with us unfortunately we werent able to make that happen
8746793 while this concludes one chapter with marcus and the saskatchewan roughriders we have discussed the possibility of him remaining with our organization in a different capacity
8746794 its also very possible marcus will choose to play for another team in our league regardless though of what decisions marcus and mona make we wish them and their family the very best

8746803 most people today know the basics about popular software programs like microsoft excel the problem is they still dont understand how to use more advanced functions like how to create a pivottable
8746804 custom online learning courses allow trainers to create courses that include only the topics their learners need in addition trainers can build custom skills assessments to test existing skills learning and growth
8746805 well the great thing about the olympics of course is you have people who are otherwise enemies putting aside their differences and pretending to get along for a couple of days im sorry thats the democratic convention
8746806 and as you know barack obama has chosen delaware senator joseph biden as his running mate well biden has 35 years of experience in washington so between the two of them thats almost 36 years of experience
8746807 and speaker of the house nancy pelosi in her speech praised joe biden calling him the full package thats what she called him thats the actual term she used she called him the full package now hes getting phone calls from senator larry craig
8746808 michelle obama said shes been in love with barack ever since he took her on their first date and bought her ice cream isnt that sweet yeah meanwhile john mccains wife cindy says shes been in love with mccain ever since he hit her over the head with a club and dragged her back to his cave
8746809 this is a weird story at the democratic convention trojan condoms has set up a pavilion where theyre handing out thousands of free condoms yeah apparently theyre doing this in case john edwards shows up
8746810 hillary gave a rousing speech it was so passionate emotional im telling you nancy pelosis face almost moved
8746811 and barack obama will give his big speech tomorrow night at invesco field a football stadium which is appropriate considering how many times democrats have fumbled in the past few years
8746812 during the democratic convention this is true delegates are being warned this year not to drink too much theyre being told not to drink too much yeah yeah when asked why democratic officials said the last time we got drunk at a convention we ended up nominating walter mondale
8746813 well as you know the democratic convention is being held this week at the pepsi center in denver dont confuse that with john mccains convention next week thats at the polygrip center thats totally different
8746814 nation today is the 88th anniversary of the 19th amendment which gave women the right to vote so big surprise tonight the democrats chose to have senator hillary clinton to give a speech now i love women in fact some of my best parents are women but marking this anniversary is the most blatant pandering to female voters since the creation of female voters you know however long ago that happened it is not the only anniversary the democrats are exploiting this week thursday night barack obama will honor the 45th anniversary of martin luther kings i have a dream speech and all democrats will honor the 25th anniversary of john mccains 1983 vote against martin luther king day
8746815 folks i just think this is typical of the democrats catering to black and female voters while ignoring the anniversaries that are significant to everyday americans for instance tomorrow august 27th happens to be the anniversary of the visigoths sack of rome in 410 a d where olerick the 1st gave his inspirational i have a dream of putting your head on a spike speech and thursday august 28th is the 101st anniversary of ups whatd the democrats do nothing you just lost the brown states pelosi and today august 26th is the 29th wedding anniversary of sam and lori doven of miami florida thats a swing state if youre not going to honor them at least call them a little more often they miss you plus tomorrow is the one day anniversary of hillary clintons landmark speech tonight shes not even being asked to speak thats a core constituency whose needs the democrats will not have addressed in almost 24 hours
8746816 coming to work today i see this guy selling maps to the stars homes right next to him a guy selling maps to john mccains homes thats a big thing now
8746817 heres a little political fact dick cheney is the first vice president in eighty years not to run for president actually cheney did consider four more years but his doctor only gave him two and a half
8746818 and florida finally starting to dry out from tropical storm fay president bush declared some counties disaster areas so they could get federal assistance once again see i think bush means well i dont think he really understands like today he said it was important to help them down there cause he considers florida one of our most important allies for when we fight the georgians were gonna need the floridians
8746819 barack obamas freshly minted running mate sen joe biden also spoke tonight and i have to say after all the name related problems this campaign has had why obama would pick a vice president with the last name biden is beyond me not that theres anything wrong with the name of biden but obama biden its like theyre trying to make their ticket sound as much like osama bin laden as possible they found the two guys in america whose names match up most closely with the person we hate more than anyone in the world and they put them on the bumper stickers very good thinking
8746820 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world
8746821 having said that the people were right and he is yet to change but this time without his daughter by his side he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my co workers my friends and a girl that means the world to me its obvious who that is
8746822 who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible
8746823 no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him
8746824 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship
8746825 i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes

8746837 waits is an utterly magnetic performer it seems less like youve bought a ticket to a concert than to a different world
8746838 waits wove a spell as intricate and engaging as that of any performer i can remember seeing on a musical stage
8746839 you were in no doubt that you had just witnessed the greatest entertainer on planet earth
8746840 for a couple of hours every night on the glitter and doom tour with waits as lightning conductor whipping up the band stirring up his demons and roaring up a storm he puts on what is quite simply the greatest show on earth
8746841 a mindblowing concert tom waits is an old time magician
8746842 jesus gonna be here soon is wild and brutal november is the quintessence of all the autumns in this world innocent when you dream is marvelous and so sweet who wouldnt want a serenade like this
8746843 the concert is almost like finding a light that will guide you to salvation
8746844 tom waits leads a show that raises a panorama of his explorations and musical obsession since his beginning in the 70s
8746845 tom waits has put a spell on the le grand rex 8 years after the last paris show of the legendary californian singer songwriter he was welcomed by a standing ovation
8746846 personal sometimes brushing against pure genius in his parodies and in his viral ironies the wait in time and the strict organization requirements to avoid the reselling of tickets were vindicated with a spectacle so captivating that could not disappoint
8746847 waits is underrated as a vocalist his baritone is easy to caricature but a lengthy concert like this one offers a chance to hear what else he can do he often capped a song with an eerie falsetto on a couple of songs he adopted the hiccupping style of early elvis presley and he was frankly emotional on the ballads that demand that approach
8746848 it was an unforgettable experience the dark humor of mr waits work can disguise its beauty and compassion but throughout this performance there were transcendent moments when the song and its expression permitted a profound understanding of what he was communicating thats what makes a concert by a gifted songwriter extraordinary
8746849 and he lived up to every inch of his reputation as a dynamic and theatrical performer there is a certain grace in toms weird angular gyrations and posturing i didnt expect him to be so sexy said one fan indeed what could be sexier than the man standing arms outstretched beneath a shower of glitter
8746850 waits did the near impossible and lived up to the great expectations
8746851 tom waits returns to the road with searing two hour set packing more than two dozen tunes into a set that was sure to satisfy any fans that made trip
8746852 in the 20 odd years since tom waits last played dallas his music has grown more demented and at the same time more poignant
8746853 that unmistakable national treasure of a voice gave the troubadour the air of a carnival barker
8746854 the greatest musical event of the year the single best musical event ive ever witnessed
8746855 waits voice is actually more complex than most would give him credit for his most marked asset is an almost feral growl yet waits can also sing in a high almost fragile voice as well and croon with the rough beauty inspired by louis armstrong
8746856 tom waits has traveled to the source of the american songbook and returned with an alternate theory of its evolution the ingredients are recognizable in flashes vaudeville bebop spoken word brill building funk hip hop but the connections he makes between them are utterly unique he connected the dots for a rapt and grateful audience
8746857 tom waits keeps em spellbound at alabama theatre although the concert lasted more than two hours waits kept listeners on the edges of their seats wondering what hed so next no sluggish spots no dead ends just an immaculately paced consistently exciting meld of music and theater
8746858 fridays show at the plaza theatre probably was unlike anything ever seen in the historic atmospheric movie palace before and after its 2006 restoration playing out like some twisted journey through a house of broken mirrors fridays concert was part performance art part roadhouse blues revival all good
8746859 waits ultimately spent the night demonstrating that hes one of the last remaining character actors in american music a self proclaimed moonlighting thespian whos always known that music is another kind of theatre a very particular storytelling practice and that its all in the delivery

8746864 john mccain weaves in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question is
8746865 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick at the time and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented to him

8746881 free comrades anarchism and homosexuality in the united states 1895 1917
8746882 were interested in the ethical social and cultural place of homosexuality within society because that question lies at the nexus of individual freedom and state power
8746883 every person who came to the lecture possessing contempt and disgust for the homo sexualists sic and who upheld the attitude of the authorities that those given to this particular form of sex expression should be hounded down and persecuted went away with a broad and sympathetic understanding of the question and a conviction that in matters of personal life freedom should reign
8746884 homosexuality had become a focus of surveillance and regulation by police and other authorities convictions for the crime of sodomy jumped and medical journals began to feature articles on the subject
8746885 conflation of crime insanity and homosexuality especially in the medical discourse reflected the commonly held belief that sexual attraction much less activity between members of the same sex was a danger to the moral and social order
8746886 was a wake up call for anarchists which prompted the anarchists to engage in an examination of the social moral and legal place of same sex desire the efforts of goldman and other anarchists on wildes behalf constitute the first articulation of a politics of homosexuality in the united states
8746887 we are all of us more or less socialists now a days
8746888 i think i am rather more i am something of an anarchist
8746889 if the socialism is authoritarian if there are governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power if in a word we have to face industrial tyrannies then the last state of man will be worse than the first
8746890 the entire persecution and sentencing of wilde struck me as an act of cruel injustice and repulsive hypocrisy on the part of the society which condemned this man
8746891 as an anarchist my place has always been on the side of the persecuted
8746892 framed his politics of homosexuality as an abstract discussion of individual rights rather than a defense of persons who were homosexuals he made no reference to identity either individual or community based
8746893 spoke of them as a persecuted minority like others deserving better treatment
8746894 homosexual desire in all its manifestations is a key theme of prison memoirs of an anarchist
8746895 it documents not just the coercive sexual culture of prisons rape and prostitution but also the consensual loves that exist behind bars
8746896 contains an entire chapter devoted to the moral ethical and social place of same sex desire berkman presents love between inmates as a form of resistance to the spirit crushing environment of prison it is one of the most important political texts dealing with homosexuality to have been written by an american before the 1950s
8746897 an appeal for tolerance and better understanding of the diverse expressions of erotic desire berkmans homosexual politics reflected his pragmatic view of the ethics of sexual desire in his lectures he contended you cant suppress the unsuppressible and that to make a crime out of erotic desire was and he knew this from personal experience in prison cruel and bound to fail you cannot regulate the fundamental human need for emotional and physical affection this position reflected basic anarchist doctrine as well as berkmans experience behind bars
8746898 i started out as a fashion photographer one cannot say that i was successful but there was enough work to keep me busy i collaborated with harpers bazaar and other magazines i was constantly aware that those who hired me would have preferred to work with a star such as avedon but it didnt matter i had work and i made a living at the same time i took my own photographs strangely enough i knew exactly what i wanted and what i liked
8746899 i spent a great deal of my life being ignored i was always very happy that way being ignored is a great privilege that is how i think i learnt to see what others do not see and to react to situations differently i simply looked at the world not really prepared for anything
8746900 somehow i feel like i can reach out and touch memory somehow it is malleable you can manipulate it form it shape it it certainly can shape you

8746902 never lose hope with our geeks that like saying the world is going to end besides the producers have confermed she is coming back
8746903 in our case photography is still waiting for interest to build im thinking of interest in photography as works of fine art that you might buy and hang in your home we expect to get that far eventually in some places it has already begun
8746904 weve re dedicated ourselves to work in this area performance in windows 7 and ie 8
8746905 this is a major initiative across each of our feature teams as well as the primary mission of one of our feature teams
8746906 im somewhat skeptical how much improvement theyre going to make at this point
8746907 anyone checking any code into windows 7 not only has to make sure its the most secure code and the most reliable code but theyd better be addressing the performance of the code as well
8746908 keep the cpu utilization low as that improves multi user scenarios as well as reduces power consumption
8746909 i wouldnt personally myself maybe if i didnt have a profile to worry about i would at the end of the day i want to be the nice guy everyone else can be dickheads about it

8746915 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a guitar hero movie it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts
8746916 x men director wants to make a guitar hero movie
8746917 nobody has the budget to bring in any form of anti doping agency let alone keep it afloat or professional enough to adhere to standards that would make it reliable the scene isnt big enough or stable enough for any world agency to enforce it right now let alone stop gamers from taking drugs

8746936 the republicans have taken us from record surpluses to an exploding national debt from over 22 million new jobs down to 5 million from an increase in working family incomes of 7 500 to a decline of more than 2 000 from almost 8 million americans moving out of poverty to more than 5 1 2 million falling into poverty and millions more losing their health insurance our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation a perilous dependence on imported oil a refusal to lead on global warming a growing indebtedness and a dependence on foreign lenders a severely burdened military a backsliding on global nonproliferation and arms control agreements and a failure to consistently use the power of diplomacy from the middle east to africa to latin america to central and eastern europe
8746937 i couldnt do what brad and angie are doing i wouldnt have the patience or dedication you need to take care of a family i admire those qualities in other people but its not for me
8746938 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person who is the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8746939 it just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
8746940 im planning to run for governor of alabama i have to live there for seven years

8746943 there were no signs of trauma or foul play well be doing toxicology and other tests which will take up to six weeks
8746944 one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in miniskirts and high heels 24 7 and go to the gym in heels
8746945 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it its really weird
8746946 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8746947 a balloon and a plastic bag containing a small amount of heroin and cocaine
8746948 i was told initially she was a little uncooperative but then she was fine
8746949 weve got them all to get back in and weve got a great chance at the next stage
8746950 but we are through and that is the main thing
8746951 it was a tricky game we are pleased to be through but with the squad we have we should look to go quite far in this competition
8746952 everyone wants to win a trophy and we think we can go quite far
8746953 we did really well out there but i was hoping we would be ready for the game

8746955 can you put your nose in the water like j
8746956 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8746957 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8746958 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8746959 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8746960 unfortunately your statement demonstrates a lack of understanding of catholic teaching and belief regarding abortion
8746961 from the apostles of the first century to pope john paul the great the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion
8746962 thus your erroneous claim about the history of the churchs opposition to abortion is false and denigrates our common faith
8746963 we find that as the nrlc said in a recent statement obama voted in committee against the 2003 state bill that was nearly identical to the federal act he says he would have supported
8746964 both contained identical clauses saying that nothing in the bills could be construed to affect legal rights of an unborn fetus according to an undisputed summary written immediately after the committees 2003 mark up session
8746965 obamas claim is wrong in fact by the time the hhs committee voted on the bill it did contain language identical to the federal act
8746966 never made it to the floor it was voted down by the health and human services committee which obama chaired
8746967 but whether or not one accepts those arguments it is not the reason obama had been giving for his 2003 opposition
8746968 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8746969 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections
8746970 thats why we are asking for a small proportion of the racing industrys prize pool to be set aside for the jockeys who put their lives on the line when they saddle up
8746971 it would be a shame to see it disrupt something like the spring carnival
8746972 if jockeys are not provided basic protections more of them will leave the sport putting the ongoing viability of the industry at risk
8746973 behind the glamour of the racing industry there is a side the general public dont see
8746974 our jockeys put their lives on the line each time they race
8746975 they shouldnt also be expected to risk financial ruin each time they race
8746976 insurance is hard to get because theres a lot of falls and theres not enough jockeys to insure
8746977 its a small array of jockeys around australia and thats all they can get
8746978 its not a big working force where you can go insure 50 000 people or something like that
8746979 australian jockeys are among the lowest paid in the world
8746980 they ride because they love the sport but they deserve basic protections

8746993 the tiniest boys and girls should be loved and protected
8746994 but as nominating barack obama emphasizes the dnc even supports killing kids in the womb old enough to know their mothers voice sleep and dream suck their thumbs and play with their toes
8746995 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8746996 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8746997 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8746998 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
8746999 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8747000 im sorry for what happened and if she ever wants to return to our museum she will be more than welcome
8747001 the room guard was over zealous he should not have done it she already passed security and his only duty was to guarantee the safety of the artwork in his room
8747002 for doing his duty and making sure the law was respected
8747003 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
8747004 the tunnels which are in surprisingly good condition were part of speers grand plans what we now call germania

8747016 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
8747017 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
8747018 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
8747019 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you

8747035 this seasons decrease in production was affected by the low quantities of rainfall in different parts of the kingdom in addition to heat waves that prevailed during the flowering times in areas dependent on rainwater which account for 77 per cent of land cultivated with olives
8747036 the ministrys decision to allow olive oil imports is designed to offset the expected shortages in olive oil supply as well as address the expected increase in prices
8747037 these presses are closely monitored through various agricultural directorates in the kingdom during and after the pressing season to ensure their compliance with the ministrys environment friendly procedures for disposal of excess residue
8747038 this new position will strengthen the kingdoms influence among olive producing countries
8747039 i think that in some quarters many parts of the country a white male is really disadvantaged
8747040 because we have developed this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them that we have in many cases twisted the thing so that its no longer a case of equal opportunity its a case of putting a fist on the scale
8747041 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
8747042 weve pushed the limits of high system requirements and i think the rate at which people are buying crazy new hardware has slowed
8747043 i think weve come out of that turbulent ten years
8747044 if you look at demigod its still wildly state of the art in our trailer people asked if that was prerendered or from the game and its all in game but its scalable theres level of detail adjustment

8747048 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
8747049 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
8747050 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
8747051 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
8747052 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
8747053 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
8747054 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
8747055 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
8747056 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8747057 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
8747058 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
8747059 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
8747060 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
8747061 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
8747062 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
8747063 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
8747064 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
8747065 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
8747066 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
8747067 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
8747068 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
8747069 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
8747070 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
8747071 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
8747072 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
8747073 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
8747074 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
8747075 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
8747076 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
8747077 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
8747078 le gouvernement aurait bien tort de penser que notre m moire puisse tre d faillante sil ne tient pas ses engagements le conflit quil aura vit en juillet aura lieu coup s r en octobre
8747079 there is a shift of consciousness in occurrence many people believe that the year 2012 will be the end of the world signifying vast destruction and major changes on our planet while there may be certain events involving earth changes our planet has been changing her complexion since the dawn of creation

8747084 its different from hyde park or central park because we dont have as much water

8747090 it is good for them to help players learn english when i learned english i became a better player but to suspend them i dont think so
8747091 we have been puzzled if not surprised by some of the reactions
8747092 you have to interact effectively with your pro am partners you need to be able to do media interviews and you need to give a winners acceptance speech in english
8747093 they must speak at a level that effectively accomplishes those three things
8747094 what were seeing is that a handful of players dont speak to the level they need to be
8747095 were not just looking at the lpga as it is now
8747096 were looking at the future of the lpga as you well know we have a large international membership all indications are its not going to get smaller
8747097 if were getting any criticism its coming from outside the organization its not coming from the players and those are the people to whom it applies
8747098 surely if you can say hello thats english is that good enough
8747099 who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8747100 its a big step to actually put it out there
8747101 i remember what roberto de vicenzo once said to me
8747102 if you shoot under 70 everybody will understand you if you dont they wont want to talk to you anyway
8747103 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8747104 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8747105 when you start with a proposition that the president of the united states is hostile to amtrak it creates a steeper hill to climb
8747106 its not a big secret in this town that joe biden is one of the biggest most vocal champions of passenger rail
8747107 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8747108 im very much hoping i wont have to cut them off today
8747109 people who go to our shows get really amped but they had nowhere to get plugged in
8747110 when they hear our music we want people to start thinking dialoging and talking about what is going on in our country
8747111 nobody in this band could do this if it werent for a bigger reason
8747112 ever since that moment ive had it in my head i dont ever want to abdicate responsibility in terms of changing the world
8747113 i think this is the biggest demonstration of the week
8747114 this is the most victorious ending i couldve ever imagined
8747115 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
8747116 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
8747117 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year

8747135 were not after pointing fingers at any particular people what we actually just want is change
8747136 people keep saying im blaming this and im blaming that
8747137 what im trying to do is explain the range of pressures that were under
8747138 there are multiple pressure points and weve got to deal with each of them but first of all weve actually got to have an open and honest discussion about the pressure points in our hospital system
8747139 when you do get a growth a temporary blimp in numbers going up the hospitals cannot cope any more and you get this bed block scenario where then emergency department cant cope because they dont have the physical space to store the patients who have to be in hospital
8747140 they need extra physical space to examine other patients to determine if theyre right to go home or they need to be in hospital
8747141 the staff can only do so much and cope with so much
8747142 there is a whole spectre of patients waiting for 24 hours to be admitted in jason recliners chairs and being forced to go into wards in x ray rooms and waiting rooms shows that townsville hospital just cant cope any more
8747143 i think with this sort of work overload and the frustrations of the staff over the last number of years is it inevitable that people will seek a more sustainable work career for their future years
8747144 its just sort of running along as sort of an extended problem here and i think that makes people quite frustrated and worn out
8747145 that tells us there has not been adequate planning that the full population influx into queensland has not been properly calculated and the impact of an ageing population is not properly understood
8747146 we get anecdotal reports of people who have been set up to have elective surgery and then having it cancelled up to six to eight times
8747147 thats an absolute tragedy i mean its an indictment on the planning of health services in queensland
8747148 the balance between elective demand and emergency demand is something we and the staff of the hospital spend a considerable energy ensuring that we get the balances close to right as we can so in a time like this where the emergency demand increases then we look to how we can perhaps look to some of our elective patients
8747149 the design of the toowoomba hospital is such that we have a number of areas that we can open a surge capacity if you like
8747150 were fortunate to be able to do that and flex up the number of beds that we are able to open when demand is as it is now
8747151 la discipline de son lectorat et de son appareil militant
8747152 the approach at the moment is testing to exhaustion but we dont see a real plan for educational change behind it all
8747153 the student tests are badly designed because they measure the course content that has been taught instead of skills and parts of them are not even comparable to previous tests they tell us what we already knew
8747154 the authorities are carrying out so many evaluations that they havent given themselves any time to plan or discuss the results and what is being done to address the situation
8747155 does not provide the knowledge nor cultivate the abilities needed to dialogue with the rest of the world and compete successfully
8747156 maintains prolongs and even exacerbates the inequalities that were there to begin with and keeps us at the bottom of a ravine which separates us from the rest of the planet
8747157 it affects the penalty for those people whose states tell them for one reason or another to act outside the rules
8747158 opens the floodgate to allow anyone to be excused from going early
8747159 well be back in the same situation we were before
8747160 its not just something that would only affect situations where the democrats control the legislature
8747161 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
8747162 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
8747163 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
8747164 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
8747165 you might like this if you define like as get justifiably angry about its an abc article on how some hysterical feminist bitch hillary supporters are now omg donating to mccain of course the actual story is that the supposed hillary supporters are people like danit aharon 40k to republicans over the past year and donated 2k to hillary after super tuesday to keep her campaign going after obama had taken a lead so ratfuckery by republicans and a failure to do even the most basic research by the media enjoy
8747166 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8747167 the large crowd that we expect is indicative of the campaign that senator obama has run from the beginning change happens from the bottom up
8747168 here we were eating lunch and it was like the clouds parted and the sun was shining she said
8747169 american idol contestant who won an oscar for the musical
8747170 yes we can speech that became a popular music video will also rock the crowd
8747171 the real point is does this just feed into the growing perception that what we have is one big glitzy production he told reporters here
8747172 but really after the crowd files out after the fireworks take place the question remains what is left and is this person ready to be president of the united states
8747173 spero che dallazienda ci sia una risposta molto forte e molto chiara questo andare avanti e indietro estenuante ed umiliante per il paese e per lazienda

8747175 for years ive had the desire to celebrate sinatras musical sensibilities but i have no desire to copy the classic songs that he rendered better than anyone else i wanted to create an album that would explore his style of singing and his style of music
8747176 we set up the recording sessions the way they were done back in the day with the entire band in one room drums next to the trumpets and saxes using only a handful of microphones to capture the warmth and depth of the music

8747178 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8747179 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8747180 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8747181 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8747182 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8747183 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8747184 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8747185 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8747186 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8747187 i need a moment to catch my breath and try to get my life back together

8747211 hot dogs are getting a bad rap lately with extremist groups trying to link them to everything from horrible diseases to the failed hillary clinton presidential campaign do the left wing processed meat hating members of the media ever cover a positive hot dog story
8747212 but heres one its about an average joe named scott who was grilling juicy hot dogs outside his house one day as they reached their most delectable state one rolled from the grill due to its cylindrical shape and fell to the ground a crestfallen scott stooped to pick it up just as a sniper from an al qaeda sleeper cell fired a round hoping to assassinate one of the leading investigative wiener journalists in the nation and bring america to its knees scott then used that wayward wiener to beat the would be assassin to death proving that in certain circumstances hot dogs are deadly but only when handled by skilled professionals

8747240 ive severed all my ties with the company gotten rid of all my financial interest i have no financial interest in halliburton of any kind and havent had now for over three years
8747241 halliburton has already raked in more than 20 billion from the bush cheney administration for work in iraq and they were awarded some of the first katrina contracts
8747242 it is unseemly for the vice president to continue to benefit from this company at the same time his administration funnels billions of dollars to it the vice president should sever his financial ties to halliburton once and for all

8747246 these efforts actually go beyond the requirements of the dmca safe harbors and made it clear that veoh was serious about responding to copyright infringement notices
8747247 the dmca protects services like youtube that follow the law and respect copyrights
8747248 youtube has gone above and beyond the law to protect content owners while empowering people to communicate and share their experiences online

8747262 we do want to have forums for our users to communicate and support each other
8747263 it doesnt necessarily mean that theyre helping elevate the good questions and helping the conversation come through

8747267 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatrioitic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american public
8747268 este es un mensaje para todos los j venes porque este hombre me hizo una persona cabal con principios y con un cuerpo y alma sano
8747269 si trattato della libera iniziativa di un guardiano che ha commesso un grave errore prenderemo provvedimenti per questioni di sicurezza a carnevale per esempio le persone che entrano mascherate vengono invitate a scoprirsi il volto ma la regola va interpretata e in questo caso la signora aveva tutto il diritto di visitare il museo
8747270 bene ha fatto quel guardasala quando ha deciso di chiedere informazioni sul da farsi di fronte a una donna invisibile
8747271 due eccessi contemporaneamente sono di troppo due veli contro la ragione sono per davvero inaccettabili
8747272 subito c chi parla di provvedimenti disciplinari contro colui che ha bloccato la signora in niq b islamico pare anche che il direttore del museo abbia detto bastava un podi buon senso ma di che buon senso stiamo parlando quando si tratta di garantire sicurezza e dignit nel corso di una visita in un museo
8747273 in italia esistono leggi e circolari ministeriali che tra il 1975 e il 2000 hanno con spirito di tolleranza normato una questione assai delicata ogni genere di copricapo va bene ogni genere di velo pu essere accettato purch lindumento mantenga il volto scoperto sia chiaro simili usi e costumi non appartengono ai doveri imposti dalla religione islamica rientrano in alcune tradizioni
8747274 ormai da tempo si accede alle zone museali solo se ci si sottopone al metal detector
8747275 noi dobbiamo rispettare gli usi e i costumi degli altri in cambio per gli altri rispettino le nostre leggi se fossi un guardasala del topkapi a istanbul non farei entrare gente vestita in modo sommario trasandato e questo perch se posti di fronte a opere darte ci si comporta e ci si veste con dignit e rispetto dei luoghi
8747276 una mia cara amica mi ha raccontato che quando decise di visitare liran partendo in aereo da parigi prima ancora di salire sullaereo islamico le fu imposto di indossare il velo tanto per dire che noi dobbiamo rispettare gli usi e i costumi degli altri in cambio per gli altri rispettino le nostre leggi ovviamente non dico una sola parola sulla dignit della donna offesa dal tradizionale niq b
8747277 ci sono tante regole che devono essere osservate ma la prima quella del buon senso
8747278 in questi casi il buon senso la ragionevolezza ci salvano nel momento in cui dobbiamo prendere delle decisioni cos si evitano degli errori
8747279 nessuno ha mai chiesto il suo allontanamento tanto meno i responsabili dei musei civici veneziani ho nuovamente parlato con lui e mi ha ribadito di non aver mai detto alla donna di uscire ma solo di averle fatto notare quanto previsto dai regolamenti

8747286 we are dismayed the mexican supreme court would ignore the overwhelming evidence that abortion hurts women upholding this law demonstrates a total lack of concern for the health and welfare of mexican women
8747287 unfortunately in the wake of this decision other latin american countries will be pressured by abortion advocates many from outside latin america to liberalize their abortion laws and put women at risk
8747288 latin american countries currently have some of the most protective abortion laws in the world
8747289 but they are facing increased pressure to cave into the demands of extremist groups like planned parenthood and the center for reproductive rights
8747290 in addition to ignoring womens health in upholding this law the court ignored the clear language of mexicos constitution which provides that life must be defended from the point of conception

8747311 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8747312 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8747313 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8747314 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8747315 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8747316 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8747317 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8747318 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8747319 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8747320 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8747321 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8747322 frequently whether hoosiers like it or not they are perceived by the outside world as the northernmost southern state carrying with it all of those things that in many southern states are considered negative

8747331 ik begin bijna vanaf nul en ben dan ook bang dat ik per kilometer 2 seconden zal verliezen op de beste rijders
8747332 dat lijkt me toch wat weinig om meteen voor de zege te kunnen strijden maar we zullen zien hoe de rallys verlopen
8747333 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8747334 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8747335 men with duchenne muscular dystrophy dmd are part of a growing population of community dwelling persons dependent on life support technologies this canadian study drew from bourdieus critical social theory to explore the identities and social positionings of 10 men with dmd in relation to dominant discourses of disability masculinity and technology semi structured interviews with participants and participant generated video diaries revealed that these men were materially socially and symbolically marginalized through inaccessible built environments social arrangements that limited their engagement in community life and the multiple ways that their bodies were negatively marked across social space furthermore their marginalization had been through processes of socialization and internalization of subordinate social positionings while the men created positive personal spaces for recognition and success their achievements were severely circumscribed by significant social inequities

8747344 look i just cant hate on any seat with a lightning bolt on it
8747345 seeeeellllllooouuuut how much are they paying you to say this
8747346 man its just a pivotal version of one of their existing designs at least its not another fashionably re covered velo and at least theyre not offering yet another re branded stump post
8747347 yeah id assume theyll do a post eventually wouldnt want the team riders to be running another companys product
8747348 youre still a moron well lets see you defend the odyssey pivotal post what are they gonna do to make it different from the 25 of them already out there
8747349 no idea maybe theyll put a pump in it or something
8747350 oh well guess well just have to wait and see

8747369 the report will encourage the reserve bank of australia to be measured in its easing cycle
8747370 rumours of the death of the australian economy are overdone
8747371 commsec still expects the reserve bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week however the latest result will clearly water down the more optimistic market views of rate cuts in coming months
8747372 twenty five basis points looks a done deal next week but further rate cuts from there have just become a whole lot less certain

8747387 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8747388 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8747389 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8747390 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8747391 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

8747401 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8747402 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8747415 in a race almost as tight as hillary clinton and obamas run for the democratic nomination for president the poodle won by a dog hair with just a few hundred votes separating the top two contenders
8747416 poodles are currently the eighth most popular breed in the us according to 2007 akc registrations statistics and spent more than two decades in the top spot a true testament to their suitability as a family pet

8747419 we solve some of the most challenging problems for more and more companies around the world let the era of visual computing begin
8747420 three d should be a new way for us to dream and design the future of our world
8747421 it will impact everything we do education science talking to each other of course games
8747422 when you fly the actual mission you feel like you are in a simulator
8747423 we really cant do our job without the good visual graphics that we get
8747424 it used to be about the computing part but the emphasis is shifting it is not so much about the computation but how it is presented and seen by people
8747425 they will be able to recreate scan data so fast you could see your own heart beating
8747426 this is being subsidized by all these kids out there playing games
8747427 but the advantages and uses of it are amazing but it is something we are going to have to get used to
8747428 we are working with the supplier and cpsc and are directing store managers to remove product identified in the cpsc press release from store shelves and initiating a register block to prevent sale
8747429 in addition we are in the process of removing this product from sale at walmart com
8747430 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8747431 all bassinets produced and sold by sfca are produced in this manner with fabric permanently attached over the lower bar and meet or exceed astm standards and cpsc guidelines
8747432 its rather obvious when you look at this bassinet that its defective and dangerous
8747433 the problem is that people dont think in those terms when you go to wal mart and find something covered with walt disneys winnie the pooh you dont think like that
8747434 im very much hoping i wont have to cut them off today
8747435 people who go to our shows get really amped but they had nowhere to get plugged in
8747436 when they hear our music we want people to start thinking dialoging and talking about what is going on in our country
8747437 nobody in this band could do this if it werent for a bigger reason
8747438 ever since that moment ive had it in my head i dont ever want to abdicate responsibility in terms of changing the world
8747439 i think this is the biggest demonstration of the week
8747440 this is the most victorious ending i couldve ever imagined
8747441 the be reel competition gave me the opportunity to create a film that delivers a message that demonstrates how something seemingly small can be so important to others i wanted to inspire and motivate people to give back through small acts of kindness like donating an old suit youve outgrown to help someone in the community become a success
8747442 i dont want to have to run spybot and avg antivirus on my phone at all times

8747444 assumindo que o ltimo boom teve in cio em 2001 devemos realmente esperar que os pre os das commodities avancem pelos pr ximos dezoito anos
8747445 n o acredito que o mundo tenha mudado muito nos ltimos anos para mudar estes 200 anos de ciclos
8747446 desde outubro de 2001 quando realmente come amos a ver um mercado de commodities com forte tend ncia de alta bull market em minha opini o o movimento est amparado em fundamentos mais notadamente no aumento da demanda da china e ndia
8747447 o mercado altista come ou em 2001 e acredito que deve manter este rumo no longo prazo por mais vinte anos
8747448 that will never wear out programs may sometimes become obsolete but the ideal of fairness always endures circumstances may change but the work of compassion must continue
8747449 for all those whose cares have been our concern the work goes on the cause endures the hope still lives and the dream shall never die
8747450 i will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism she didnt have any health insurance and she discovered that she had cancer but she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for health care for her and her children
8747451 i will always remember the young man in a marine corps t shirt who waited months for medical care and he said to me take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please take care of me
8747452 and i will always remember the young boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage that her employer had cut her hours he said he just didnt know what his family was going to do
8747453 were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
8747454 john kerry believes in america and he knows that its not enough for just some of us to prosper for alongside our famous individualism theres another ingredient in the american saga a belief that were all connected as one people if there is a child on the south side of chicago who cant read that matters to me even if its not my child if there is a senior citizen somewhere who cant pay for their prescription drugs and having to choose between medicine and the rent that makes my life poorer even if its not my grandparent if theres an arab american family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process that threatens my civil liberties
8747455 never ask an american family to sacrifice for another american family
8747456 the 1980 republican convention was awash with crocodile tears for our economic distress
8747457 the same republicans who are talking about the crisis of unemployment have nominated a man who once said and i quote unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for freeloaders and that nominee is no friend of labor
8747458 the same republicans who are talking about the problems of the inner cities have nominated a man who said and i quote i have included in my morning and evening prayers every day the prayer that the federal government not bail out new york
8747459 the same republicans who are talking about security for the elderly have nominated a man who said just four years ago that participation in social security should be made voluntary and that nominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation
8747460 the same republicans who are talking about preserving the environment have nominated a man who last year made the preposterous statement and i quote eighty percent of our air pollution comes from plants and trees and that nominee is no friend of the environment
8747461 have nominated a man who said in 1976 and these are his exact words fascism was really the basis of the new deal
8747462 the great adventures which our opponents offer is a voyage into the past
8747463 progress is our heritage not theirs what is right for us as democrats is also the right way for democrats to win
8747464 it is surely correct that we cannot solve problems by throwing money at them but it is also correct that we dare not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and indifference
8747465 the poor may be out of political fashion but they are not without human needs the middle class may be angry but they have not lost the dream that all americans can advance together
8747466 as democrats we recognize that each generation of americans has a rendezvous with a different reality
8747467 the answers of one generation become the questions of the next generation but there is a guiding star in the american firmament it is as old as the revolutionary belief that all people are created equal and as clear as the contemporary condition of liberty city and the south bronx
8747468 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8747469 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8747470 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8747471 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8747472 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8747473 to some of you it may sound very dramatic but that is in fact the reality for millions of people around the world
8747474 water is a resource without substitute it is paramount to our health our food security our energy future and our ecosystem
8747475 but corruption plagues water management and use in all these areas
8747476 for many years we have been trying to encourage the government to manage the forested mountains in east africa more responsibly and more accountably
8747477 and not to use forestland to give to their political friends or cronies or to use that land for human settlements to appease communities or groups because they are political supporters
8747478 the more we encroach on our forests the more we make ourselves very vulnerable because the best harvesters of rainwater are forests
8747479 corruptions impact on water is a fundamental governance problem yet it is not sufficiently addressed in the many global policy initiatives for environmental sustainability development and food and energy security
8747480 the people of iraq probably would not agree with that
8747481 a state of the nation novel without the po faced worthiness this has everything gangsters parliament anglicanism and council estate soap opera a formidable and wryly written treat
8747482 the walls started moving then the bang everything started coming down everyone started screaming
8747483 they either had a meal here or live here and were walking to the trolley
8747484 theres not much to say other than we have to find out what happened
8747485 during a crisis the ability to communicate is even more critical for individuals families and emergency response personnel we are committed to providing our customers with the best network coverage possible in every situation
8747486 our preparations are designed to give customers maximum reliability from their wireless phones at the time of greatest need
8747487 in 2005 we saw in a very personal way that people depend on their wireless phones as a lifeline to the outside world not just for a day but for weeks and even months at a time
8747488 this microwave technology is critical to support communications during natural disasters when landline systems are inoperable
8747489 for many of our mississippi customers cellular south was the first and only means of communication available during and after hurricane katrina
8747490 we want our customers to know that we stand ready to respond to whatever circumstances come their way
8747491 describe him as a humbled changed man whose family is suffering and nearly broke after his first 18 months in prison
8747492 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8747493 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8747494 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8747495 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8747496 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8747497 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8747498 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8747499 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8747500 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8747501 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
8747502 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8747503 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8747504 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8747505 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8747506 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8747507 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8747508 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8747509 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8747510 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8747511 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8747512 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8747513 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8747514 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8747515 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8747516 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8747517 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8747518 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8747519 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8747520 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8747521 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8747522 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8747523 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8747524 is if you just use you bob and you bob as caricatures the truth is both of you acknowledge the world is more complicated
8747525 the economy has changed in the last 15 years and our understanding of economic policy has changed as well
8747526 and that means that what was appropriate in 1993 is no longer appropriate
8747527 i still would have probably made a slightly different choice than clinton did
8747528 i probably wouldnt have been as obsessed with deficit reduction
8747529 she had to think very practically about how do you make money
8747530 how does the system work that led me to have an orientation to ask hardheaded questions during my formative years there was still ideological competition between a social democratic or even socialist agenda and a free market milton friedman agenda i think it was natural for me to ask questions of both sides and maybe try to synthesize approaches
8747531 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
8747532 i like to think of him as a university of chicago democrat
8747533 ive never worked with a campaign that was more interested in what the research shows
8747534 this could be one of the biggest pieces of corporate welfare ever
8747535 the market is the best mechanism ever invented for efficiently allocating resources to maximize production
8747536 and i also think that there is a connection between the freedom of the marketplace and freedom more generally
8747537 weve probably done a better job of the last 20 years on the problems the market can solve than the problems the market cant solve were doing pretty well on the size of peoples houses and televisions and the like were not looking so good on infrastructure and education
8747538 the free market centrism of the clinton years to a revived push for european style social democracy
8747539 this is in many respects a deeply un american solution to the problems facing our country
8747540 one that would emphasize dependence over self sufficiency and bureaucratic condescension over self help
8747541 if you talk to warren hell tell you his preference is not to meddle in the economy at all let the market work however way its going to work and then just tax the heck out of people at the end and just redistribute it
8747542 that way youre not impeding efficiency and youre achieving equity on the back end
8747543 i do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of control that we want individuals to have in determining their own career paths making their own life choices and so forth and i also think you want to instill that sense of self reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes
8747544 we all talk about apollo 11 but there were some pretty public pretty awful failures along the way
8747545 the united states didnt say well we had some failures
8747546 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
8747547 one just because i think it really captures where i was going with the whole issue of balancing market sensibilities with moral sentiment one of my favorite quotes is you know that famous robert f kennedy quote about the measure of our g d p
8747548 well ill send it to you because its one of the most beautiful of his speeches
8747549 counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them
8747550 the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play

8747621 people who go to our shows get really amped but they had nowhere to get plugged in
8747622 when they hear our music we want people to start thinking dialoging and talking about what is going on in our country
8747623 nobody in this band could do this if it werent for a bigger reason
8747624 ever since that moment ive had it in my head i dont ever want to abdicate responsibility in terms of changing the world
8747625 i think this is the biggest demonstration of the week
8747626 this is the most victorious ending i couldve ever imagined

8747643 despite its many shortcomings mario super sluggers is good enough to offer some solid entertainment to the right gamers collect em all mariophiles will dig the new challenge mode and wii party hosts will enjoy playing frantic multiplayer games more serious baseballers will find satisfaction in facing off against one another but will find the rest of the package wanting
8747644 we wouldnt go as far as to say this is nintendo made shovelware but theres very little that has changed in the three years between mario superstar baseball on gcn and mario super sluggers on wii youve got a few new characters in the mix a few new mini games mii support for on field play and an interesting ir based item shooting system
8747645 away from the madness of the team selection its as solid a game as youd expect from any sports title with marios name attached theres a challenge mode where youre forced to pick from certain characters which is also how you unlock some of the hidden horrors on the roster and a decent variety of playing fields that come with their own unique hazards and occasionally bizarre obstructions
8747646 between the creative fields chemistry boosts and supermoves any given contest has a lot going on delivering a hectic but entertaining experience as a result balance isnt the games strongest suit and besides some significant stat differences some characters have supermoves that essentially guarantee hits like daisys field of sleep inducing flowers while others can be handled easily enough like bowsers fireball line drives but the a i proves far more criminal when it comes to baserunning

8747652 there are definitely guys who come back to the clubhouse and you see the expression on their face
8747653 its like man ive got to try to do something and theyre halfway defeated before they get up there
8747654 a lot of times they ask knowing their free agent year is coming and trying to get a feel for how our fans are they usually know how our team is
8747655 a lot of times they dont want to put their families or their kids into a situation where they come to the field and these are the types of things their kids will have to listen to and thats just the truth those arent my words those are words ive actually heard ive tried to get a number of players to come here and i think im 0 for whatever right now
8747656 t he change of venue thursday nightto invesco field and the huge open air obama acceptance speech is

8747659 we dont have the schedule out yet but the big ten is going to help us out there

8747663 an air force reconnaissance plane has found a surprise this morning
8747664 gustav has either reformed to the south or been moving more to the south south west overnight the reformation of the center has caused a big southward change in the early part of the forecast
8747665 this should allow gustav to turn more to the west and then northwest around the time it enters the gulf of mexico
8747666 a mid latitude high is forecast to be in the ohio valley in about five days which may continue steering the storm northwest rather than allow a more northward motion
8747667 if you were a superhero what superhero power would you want
8747668 the positive thing about having any storm hit you it will reveal any kind of frailty in the system
8747669 its not worth putting your life at risk if you have the means to get out
8747670 jerry had all his pitches working today the fastball the slowball the ball that starts fast and then slows down right before it reaches the plate and the breaking pitch that starts down the middle and then slowly curves 15 feet outside as the batter begins his swing
8747671 his pitch sequences were set up beautifully he did a great job of throwing pitches inside to make the batter stand in the far corner of the batters box and then coming back with a fastball that painted the outside corner worked every time
8747672 lucasarts in particular wasnt happy at being kept in the dark especially since it created star wars the clone wars lightsaber duels specifically for the console

8747676 we are negotiating with a landlord in town and we want to stay in the centre
8747677 its been put to us arcade tenants that you put your quote in and the highest tenders get the outlets skyline said they would consider us and theyve been very fair
8747678 as tenants who have been there for eight or nine years we found the process frustrating
8747679 but this open ended auction doesnt appeal to us at all they are obviously trying to get the best tenders and i would too
8747680 weve consulted with the existing arcade tenants firstly and we did say if there was a national firm that was interested in selling a product like theirs we would come back and consult with them further

8747686 for technical reasons we have to install receivers it cant be done by saturday
8747687 and it certainly couldnt be done in all of the iowa launch areas by saturday
8747688 we may be moving a channel or changing the lineup to make room were doing all of that as expeditiously as possible
8747689 some people will get the channel more quickly than others
8747690 it was difficult for us and difficult for mediacom im glad they kept pushing and pushing to get it done in time for opening weekend
8747691 its a great network we just had to get it fully distributed
8747692 our goal is to put it on family cable and that is where its going
8747693 i think it was pretty clear that both sides were committed to getting a deal done
8747694 we wanted to make this available and tried to make it available and were glad to get to this point
8747695 im very very happy with how the university has committed to me and my family
8747696 i think its a vote of confidence from gary barta and the university they are happy with the success weve had on the floor
8747697 we took into consideration that lisa has had a great tenure here
8747698 she stands for everything we believe in philosophically shes proven she can have success here
8747699 you want to reward your performers when they do a great job
8747700 the better the year the higher the performance level the greater the financial reward for the coach if someone has an elite 8 season that is something special
8747701 he looks at the success in the classroom and the type of people we recruit
8747702 i think its important when you are recruiting athletes that you are going to be leading the program the whole time
8747703 the recruits want to know and should know its important
8747704 it was very important to us but it wasnt urgent
8747705 with l a ive been there 20 years and i dont like it
8747706 but the work keeps coming and coming i realize i could just go somewhere else and create the work
8747707 its really like sandra bullock and matthew mcconaughey moving to austin and just making a home there and doing their movies there that can happen anywhere
8747708 i wouldnt say a lot of its about me or my experiences so much
8747709 i found a lot of true characters in that world
8747710 this is a comedy in the same vein as adam mckay movies grounded in reality
8747711 its like step brothers the flavor the tone its not goofy whacked out
8747712 a lot of people that come here in a few days theyre thinking where can i live
8747713 an air force reconnaissance plane has found a surprise this morning
8747714 gustav has either reformed to the south or been moving more to the south south west overnight the reformation of the center has caused a big southward change in the early part of the forecast
8747715 further strengthening of gustav is anticipated as it moves either across western cuba or through the yucatan channel and into the central gulf of mexico
8747716 due to this uncertainty all interests along the gulf of mexico from brownsville to the florida keys should monitor the progress
8747717 gustav may slow down considerably just before landfall in the u s making its long term track and landfall location very uncertain at this time
8747718 this should allow gustav to turn more to the west and then northwest around the time it enters the gulf of mexico
8747719 a mid latitude high is forecast to be in the ohio valley in about five days which may continue steering the storm northwest rather than allow a more northward motion
8747720 i have confidence in myself and i think the coaches throughout the fall have gotten a lot more confident in us as specialists because last year we were kind of mediocre we had good games and we had bad games
8747721 i dont really worry about it too much because i just want to play
8747722 i think its healthy it pushes me because even last year with austin we both had a competition but we werent as accurate throughout the fall so it didnt really push us
8747723 but i think trent coming in for me at least he was pretty accurate so it pushed me continually because youve got to do the best you can you cant just have a bad day or a couple bad days because trent will stay the same
8747724 i think both of them are doing a great job out there
8747725 but for the big big picture theyve really done a good job and theyre competing well
8747726 so i think the extra points hurt me just in the publics eye
8747727 wisconsin i think was an interesting situation just because i kind of went out not knowing how to prepare for the situation
8747728 i just kind of went out and did what i knew i could do
8747729 i didnt really over think anything i just went in there and basically just kicked the ball and i think that helped me out quite a bit
8747730 ive got a little experience under my belt and i know what to expect
8747731 compared to last year i should say its night and day pretty much compared to where we were last year
8747732 we may not feel direct effects but were going to potentially be affected in some ways
8747733 the idea is to get people through the parish and to shelters elsewhere
8747734 we could be called upon to be a place to warehouse supplies and be a central distribution center
8747735 we also could be called upon to house emergency responders or be a shelter all of those possibilities exist post hurricane
8747736 were on standby waiting to see if they are going to require us to do anything
8747737 we certainly have in motion communications with state police and they are involved extensively with our agency in monitoring traffic and providing the best and most useful real time information on those boards
8747738 as things progress and if it looks like its going to come toward louisiana or the gulf coast that dictates whether we move to a level two
8747739 we are also contacting vendors that would supply needed materials for restoration and securing any inventory we would need
8747740 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8747741 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8747742 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8747743 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8747744 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8747745 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8747746 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8747747 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8747748 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8747749 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8747750 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8747751 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8747752 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8747753 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8747754 were working with congress to change some non effective laws
8747755 other utility companies are joining forces with us as well as petrochemical plants were willing to throw ourselves in the middle of the ring to get this done
8747756 early landfall projections show southeast louisiana as the center of the however no one along the gulf coast is out of the woods
8747757 it is important to note that there still remains significant uncertainty regarding gustavs ultimate track
8747758 we have 100 years of innovation behind us but whats ahead is even more exciting
8747759 we brought the world electric starters the fully automatic transmission onstar and fuel cell vehicles its been a long history of technological leadership and the result of that innovative spirit is on gm dealers lots today to celebrate were offering the employee discount to everyone on our 2008 and some of our 2009 models this is a phenomenal offer for consumers
8747760 irl though the food they eat makes it so they only have to sh t every 3 5 days you wouldnt be eating much either 1 cause of movement 2 so you dont have to sh t ur pants
8747761 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8747762 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8747763 reducir las desigualdades en materia de salud es un imperativo tico la injusticia social mata a la gente a gran escala
8747764 un ni o nacido en la periferia de glasgow en escocia tendr una esperanza de vida inferior en 28 a os a otro nacido a 13 km de ah
8747765 no existe ninguna buena raz n biol gica para explicar eso
8747766 al entorno social en el que la gente nace vive crece trabaja y envejece
8747767 los sistemas de salud no tienden naturalmente hacia la equidad es necesario hacer un esfuerzo de direcci n sin precedentes para llevar a todos los actores inclusive los de fuera del sector de la salud a examinar los efectos sobre la salud
8747768 un sistema de salud financiado con el dinero p blico
8747769 un impuesto general y o por un seguro universal obligatorio
8747770 la equidad en materia de salud debe ser un objetivo fundamental del desarrollo
8747771 los cuidados de salud son un bien p blico y no una mercanc a comercial
8747772 cuba costa rica china el estado de kerala en india y sri lanka han alcanzado niveles de salud satisfactorios pese a un ingreso nacional relativamente poco importante
8747773 i dont think the future of the internet is depressing at all for every security flaw there is a fix as i see it there are two problems currently facing the internet the first is net neutrality which will be a key battleground over the next ten years eventually the net will go back to being neutral but in the meantime there will be some problems for users not being able to access all internet content the second problem is the second dotcom bubble which is under increasing pressure during the current economic climate however if it does burst the internet will eventually recover from this too its a long game internet problems might look bad right now but in 10 years they will be ancient history
8747774 at the moment ive got bigger worries ipv6 adoption is ridiculously slow at least in the united states ipv4 has 2 32 4 294 967 296 just over 4 billion unique addresses and an even smaller number of available addresses if ipv6 adoption doesnt pick up youll start seeing isps no longer providing unique ip addresses to home users connecting to the web and instead pushing them through nat universities need to adopt ipv6 on their networks just to give it and computer science students enough exposure on whats coming up students in any subject need exposure to it so that the internet doesnt become less alien to them than it may already be however in terms of internet security theres no single problem or combination of problems either via operating systems browser flaws or even major websites will take down the internet if anything takes down the internet its going to be an infrastructural flaw right now that flaw looks like ipv4 and if isps not just universities have to start relying on nat for all of their home users a whole bunch of application problems will suddenly arise
8747775 further strengthening of gustav is anticipated as it moves either across western cuba or through the yucatan channel and into the central gulf of mexico

8747784 someone told me about a 74 year old delegate who claims shes going to vote for mccain

8747793 hace cuatro a os que no tenemos ese instrumento de protecci n porque es muy caro
8747794 lo que compramos fue como un 5 6 del consumo total de barriles que utilizamos para producir energ a y fueron 7 5 millones de barriles de combustible eso nos cost 7 3 millones y obtuvimos cerca de 10 5 millones de ganancia producto de esas transacciones que se les pas a su vez en alivios a los clientes
8747795 cuando venci el seguro en 2004 el precio estaba en 39 el barril comparado a la protecci n que venci que era de 22 el barril al existir esas fluctuaciones de precio comenz la inestabilidad en el mercado y decidimos no continuar

8747799 i had a patient who basically tore his rotator cuff completely and when i say tore it it was unreconstructible
8747800 i cant tell you how many times ive said to myself i have to do something about this
8747801 ill get out at 10 oclock and i came in at 5 45 for a pre shift briefing
8747802 theres three things you worry about when you come to work the first thing is are you going to get out at the end of your shift the second one is are you going to get assaulted
8747803 we want to support our staff we believe with open communication and new management approach well be able to make improvements
8747804 after repeated threats and multiple mandates you start to question why you even work here
8747805 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far
8747806 we are delighted that the crtv membership has so strongly endorsed our offer
8747807 we look forward to serving the campbell river customers who join their neighbours from courtenay and the comox valley in choosing shaw
8747808 we are proud of the services we developed and offered at crtv over the last 50 years
8747809 our members recognize that they will enjoy an enhanced offering of entertainment internet and digital phone services through shaw
8747810 in any country today we have to look at the children
8747811 our daughter was a month old when we adopted her and it was just such a fun time and made us very close seeing what love and affection can do for little ones is really why i got so excited for hhi
8747812 some of the caregivers spoke swahili so the instructional posters really helped
8747813 so cute to watch and you could tell that she was enjoying the massage when i massaged her tummy and chest her arms would just fall out to her sides and she would relax
8747814 they were very excited and took some of the massage posters home to give to their own babies a massage
8747815 when i was in the slums i walked into the play area that had nothing but dirt that is where they eat congregate and do everything i looked for a place where i could lay a baby down for a massage and i couldnt find one at the minimum 2 babies shared one bed the conditions were so bad that i didnt think it would be healthy to do a massage there
8747816 the government doesnt run the orphanages in kenya although the are registered under the kenyan ministry of social services and some have department of social services representatives on their board they are run by nonprofit organizations meaning that hhi would need to find a way to connect with the organizations or the foundations but laura hhis executive director always finds a way i understand and believe that hhi is needed in kenya i think it would be an important part of the infant care especially for babies who have lost their parents to hiv aids
8747817 i love the program i think laura has gotten the most bang for her buck with what she has invested into hhi she is remarkable
8747818 i am pleased with the companys continued improvement in its operations during the second quarter which has translated to stronger operating margins and profitability for the second quarter revenues were 38 6 million usd ebitdas was 5 76 million usd and net income was 1 34 million usd the company is well positioned to continue its accelerating financial performance on both the top line and bottom line for the balance of the year

8747822 thousands of photos are sent to visa pour as proposals for exhibitions and evening programs and over the last two or three years these pictures have been increasingly neat and tidy increasingly standardized and to put it bluntly tedious with the same old stories seen from the same old angles and this tendency is getting even stronger
8747823 you know i dont want to judge mr littemans character but a company and its practices are more often than not a direct reflection on the guy running the show

8747833 i was angry to think that somebody who could have potentially killed people got away with just a mid range pca drink driving charge he hasnt even apologised
8747834 if it was my child who did that to someone id be making them face the person they did it to
8747835 i had a blue with the missus and i went around the corner a little bit faster than i should have

8747843 its his place to feel confident to do what he wants to do
8747844 eds perfectly happy doing his own thing so we will let him dictate how we progress
8747845 as he becomes more confident he will be seeking interaction with kids his own age which hopefully means hell return to school
8747846 we usually do see more people register each olympic year
8747847 i would say in the country areas particularly it does get kids into sport
8747848 they were very excited by sally mclellan and people like that do have an impact on the kids
8747849 this year particularly because theres a whole new group of role models
8747850 theres usually a rush especially in the sports with some success
8747851 they start to link a name with a sport kids can name stephanie rice and eamon sullivan and they are incredibly interested
8747852 olympic success in a particular sport usually increased participation in that sport

8747874 he looks to be in pretty good shape other than him being grossly obese when you look down at the cat you cant even see his feet
8747875 he looks to be in pretty good shape other than him being grossly obese
8747876 he looks alright considering the fact that hes fat as a whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaale and more out of shape than your grandma
8747877 does she drive does she have money to buy food does she stock your pantry no then you do control what she eats

8747884 we were at his apartment talking and he goes i guess theres no point in waiting any longer so lets just do this get engaged before you go back to school and i agreed but i dont have a ring yet
8747885 i was just looking around thinking where would they all fit
8747886 i barely have room for me and my three kids
8747887 sure but gdp increased as a result of tax cuts so overall revenue increased
8747888 it is a big job thats for sure pre polling opens first thing monday but we really have no data to work out what to expect but we are anticipating pre polling in orange to be busy because of the sheer size of the population
8747889 pre polling is important because its pretty obvious not everyone is in a position to vote on election day but their vote is still required regardless
8747890 also if we need to provide new services based on the needs of a new business then we would obviously look at some kind of contribution from that business
8747891 in fact the lack of foresight and action from the previous federal government on investment in regional airport infrastructure and security has put many of australias travelling public at risk
8747892 these kids want their own identity and want to have their own team
8747893 they want to hear about what theyre doing this year theyre very cognizant that last year is history
8747894 the game plan is spread the field and say try to take away chris right here and let matt throw all day to his receivers
8747895 if you take matt away its hard to bring chris down in space
8747896 its a different team but a lot of kids played in the playoffs
8747897 it was a great experience but going farther this year is their goal
8747898 they are starting to understand how we do things the seniors have been practicing with us since their sophomore year they are starting to pick it up
8747899 we have to find a way to get a couple of those guys
8747900 i figure if you shut people out you cant lose you can always find a way to score a point
8747901 the success weve been having changed everyones way of thinking we can play with anyone
8747902 if you get the ball around him theres a good chance hes going to make the play
8747903 it will come down to the way we practice and how good we want to be
8747904 in virtually all cases no notice meaningful hearing or impartial weighing of evidence is to be had
8747905 americas leading edge boomer generation is rapidly becoming empty nesters and grandparents but once again the boomers are doing it their way and are changing the traditional definition of retirement
8747906 this is a huge opportunity to share our passion for the outdoors
8747907 but weve continued to ask ourselves with all this interest why dont more young people get outdoors this past year president bush all government agencies state and federal parks and departments of health directed americans to get outdoors
8747908 in the late 50s the american outdoor movement began for many years the outdoor movement consisted of government actions directed toward acquiring public land wilderness preservation and conservation america now has great resources technology trails lakes and rivers so why a sedentary based health crisis with americas youth what happened to the get outdoors plan why arent americas youth getting outdoors and exercising at the american outdoorsman we are convinced the reason is the insecurity of being in nature without more knowledge about outdoor living and skills experienced kayakers hikers canoers and mountain bikers are in the outdoors an average of 15 times a year the american outdoorsman in conjunction with 82 thousand trails preserves will provide a new joint initiative from two proven outdoor experience companies this initiative will teach skills and package custom outdoor experiences for boomers youth and multi generational family groups the american outdoorsman certified pro staff offer outdoor resorts an appealing new much needed health and wellness benefit unique professionally guided outdoor experiences are the key its about creating outdoor adventures for all family members from canoeing to fishing and hiking to filming wildlife where everyone can feel safe learn how to participate at the highest level they choose and most importantly spend time together exercise is fun at any age and fitness level with the american outdoorsmans customized outdoor adventures
8747909 americans have been the worlds leading outdoorsman for almost 300 years

8747916 i have a buy on dlf because it is launching its projects in line with plans even after a discount of 15 20 it is worth buying because its affordable housing projects are selling and are not facing delays but i am not considering bidadi knowledge city near bangalore and dankuni township project in kolkata where dlf is dependent on the government for land acquisition

8747922 there isnt an issue at this years us open of players not speaking english and those that dont speak english fluently still attempt to speak enough english to be able to conduct press conferences in that language
8747923 it has not been an issue the girls seem to pick up english pretty quickly
8747924 so great is the desire which god has to dispense to his graces that as st augustine says he is more anxious to give them to us than we are desirous to receive them from him
8747925 every attack on the christian faith made today has as its basis the doctrine of evolution

8747930 one of the most energetic and imaginative voices to reach our western antennas
8747931 i dont need anything from human beings except love and money
8747932 hes one of those kids who likes to be a fly on the wall and is a pretty humble kid about all that stuff
8747933 i just play football and dont worry about the headlines as much
8747934 now that we know what its like to get to the playoffs i think we know how to excel through the playoffs
8747935 i thnk well actually get more respect this year in the past everyone thought of us pretty much as a blowoff game
8747936 it was different because i hadnt been on any losing teams
8747937 being the youngest kid on the team and not knowing what varsity is like was different
8747938 it worked out really good from my point and im able to have this offense now
8747939 ive heard about too many kids who have a bad senior year
8747940 i like being the leader of the offense and having a say in what happens
8747941 in the group that have had two positive drug tests half of them have got significant mental health issues maybe depression or some sort of personality problem
8747942 the use of illicit substances is a symptom of a far deeper problem
8747943 it has taken two failed tests in some circumstance for us to understand the full extent of the problems were dealing with
8747944 when we hear discussion about reducing from three strikes to two strikes or two chances to one we are thinking of this particular vulnerable group
8747945 were advised by medical experts that there is increasing evidence of links between marijuana and mental illness
8747946 the nice things is weve got enough numbers this year particularly on the line
8747947 weve got some nice competition so i hope its going to improve us
8747948 you dont find too many 6 foot 2 players with strength who can run
8747949 hands down hes the fastest kid on our team he has some speed
8747950 i had some speed at freeport when we were having some success players that went on to play ball at the d i level he would not have been out of place there its just a matter of him continuing to work and staying focused
8747951 i just want us to have a winning record and go into the playoffs
8747952 better practices have really upgraded the learning curve for us
8747953 now its just a matter of can we get to where we need to be
8747954 i think its an enormous shame with two guys hopefully about to kick 100 goals it should be live on telly rather than delayed 30 minutes
8747955 i got a call wednesday afternoon at 3 oclock saying no decision today it might be tomorrow perhaps friday
8747956 i doubt it but we havent focused on it at all
8747957 theyve been terrific around the club the amount of work theyve been doing theyve been training and doing everything with us
8747958 hes a very good player daniel kerr maybe someone might be prepared to trade out a first round pick
8747959 the negotiation would be heavily in favour of the team that wants to get him
8747960 well keep our picks we wont be trading we want to keep our first pick and as of today theres also 17 and 19
8747961 we have a young list now and this year its important that we draft well you cant pick and choose drafts and you have to ensure you put all of the work into it so you can produce and develop
8747962 we made progress thats all i can really say at this stage
8747963 weve still got a bit to work through but im not going to talk about the details
8747964 we think it will be another couple of weeks before anything is finalised
8747965 im hearing all the rumours that he is interested in returning to port but ill believe it when i see it we havent spoken to him and i dont know what he wants to do
8747966 ill sit down with my family and the footy club and try to sort things out in the next few weeks
8747967 well discuss a lot of things footy life all that and see what the best thing is to do
8747968 as a senior group we are not happy with the form we are producing
8747969 we are the group of guys at the footy club who need to step up and it has been put on us that we are that group we know we are and we have to do something about it this week
8747970 the form that we played on the weekend definitely youd have to agree with that

8747978 this program promotes our linguistic duality of which we are very proud as canadians it is part of our identity and a cornerstone of our country
8747979 this is a wonderful investment in our young people and a tangible contribution to the development of a genuinely bilingual canada
8747980 second language instruction and support for francophones and anglophones living in minority communities are essential to ensure the future of canadas linguistic duality and to bring canadians together throughout the country
8747981 the ag has said that the contract needs to be examined under the prevalent policy which states that no new airport will be permitted unless the existing airport is saturated
8747982 even if the victim in a given case has been promiscuous in her sexual behaviour earlier she has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone
8747983 even assuming that the victim was previously accustomed to sexual intercourse that is not a determinative question on the contrary the question which was required to be adjudicated was did the accused commit rape on the victim
8747984 even if it is hypothetically accepted that the victim had lost her virginity earlier it did not and cannot in law give licence to any person to rape her it is the accused who was on trial and not the victim
8747985 though we run the plants on coal sourced from talcher mines of mahanadi coalfield ltd we were also blending the domestic supply with imported coal to get higher efficiency
8747986 we have come across such a case wherein smugglers have been using the internet to trade animals birds skin and other animal body parts for the first time the two accused who have been arrested are only a small link of this pan india smuggling ring
8747987 since the buyers and sellers dont meet in person it becomes difficult to track them down
8747988 since it is difficult to smuggle animals and animal products poachers have started using the internet because they know it is a relatively safe option and would make it difficult for us to trace them
8747989 three machines were sealed at the shraddha maternity home bhayander which is owned by dr rajesh karodia
8747990 it also did not have the pndt act book around and neither did it have proper records of patients
8747991 they have several patients coming from mumbai limits and that could be because clinics within the city are strict about not conducting sex determination
8747992 all my machines are registered and one is lying defunct since the last 12 years
8747993 india has over 70 million elderly and the figure is expected to escalate to 177 million by 2025
8747994 however senior citizens in our country face several problems either their presence is not acknowledged or they are lonely also there is in an increase in the numbers of abuse cases against them
8747995 we have already received around 50 70 applications but the course offers only 30 seats it is open for professionals students as well as housewives the main aim is that we should understand the life and the needs of those in their twilight years
8747996 apart from giving them emotional support we also need to learn how the senior citizens are susceptible to diseases and how to deal with them
8747997 i dont feel elitist at all and i think thats a really important thing to tackle
8747998 caring about the environment caring about good food caring about peace even on a micro level with bullying in the schools all the way up to how we treat each other as nations these arent elitist things and the successful branding of this stuff as elitist has contributed to the problem big time these are common sense things that we should care about every day
8747999 thats fine but whats not fine to me is when that kind of entertainment is used as a way not to think about the larger things
8748000 there was a story in the new york times magazine recently about the troops in afghanistan and one of the young marines said i bleeping cant believe people back in the states care more about britney spears than me and the other guys in my battalion
8748001 party party in a tweety land b w this republic of suffering
8748002 in a world where the human suffering inflicted by wars natural disasters hunger drug addiction and other natural manmade causes feels ever present people are increasingly becoming numb to the plight of others overwhelmed by the enormity of suffering and mired in frustration with how to alleviate it some retreat into private worlds others distract themselves with celebrity infatuation or indulge in decadent behavior to keep the world at bay some find transcendence and meaning for their own suffering through religious models
8748003 were obsessed with owning things and with the lives of total strangers the things that are really meaningful have become obscured by all this junk everywhere the touchstones that should be there for our lives to make sense are becoming increasingly obscured so you feel kind of rudderless because the things that we should be caring about like the natural world around us and peace arent valued i mean its hard to even talk about peace nowadays because its like peace is for chumps
8748004 colleen and i have chosen work that represents the ways people turn away from the suffering in the world because its too much or because they just cant think of ways to handle it
8748005 scott seekins painting of himself with britney spears or javier tavera has these amazing photographs of people at raves where theyre on another planet theyve taken themselves to another place
8748006 i think we just seek to illuminate and i think thats the role of artists and writers and other creative people we dont have all the answers nobody does but we can help illuminate a little piece of whats happening in our collective life and then everybody has to think about these things hopefully
8748007 the policy was on the right path to start with it is about rehabilitation and education and our club has supported that view
8748008 they have improved on it the debatable things for us is that a club wasnt made aware early in the process and a failed test hung around the players neck forever now it lapses after four years
8748009 its a good policy and its transparent and it will allow players to be role models
8748010 our club position and we had a board meeting about it a year ago is that we would have preferred two strikes however the three strikes is not a major issue we can live with it
8748011 i still think there is an argument to suggest clubs should be part of the solution in terms of the rehab process prior to three strikes but there are convincing arguments about the independence of a player during the rehab
8748012 we still have to pick through the detail tomorrow but in essence we are very supportive of what they have done
8748013 and we want to send a message to all young people that it drug use is not ok
8748014 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
8748015 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
8748016 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
8748017 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
8748018 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
8748019 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
8748020 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
8748021 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
8748022 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
8748023 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
8748024 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
8748025 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
8748026 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
8748027 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
8748028 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
8748029 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
8748030 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
8748031 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
8748032 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
8748033 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
8748034 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
8748035 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
8748036 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
8748037 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
8748038 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
8748039 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
8748040 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
8748041 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
8748042 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
8748043 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
8748044 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
8748045 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
8748046 as a team we look forward to travelling weve got a pretty good record so theres no fear for us whatever time of the year it is
8748047 weve got a very good record especially over in perth
8748048 its in our control if we win were in the top four until the kangaroos play at least so its up to us
8748049 freo have a lot of blokes who are retiring so theyre going to be out to beat us
8748050 ive been in that position before when collingwood was down the bottom of the ladder where youre playing just to knock a team off and wreck their finals chances
8748051 theyll be fired up so its a matter of us taking them on early
8748052 were a pretty young side at the moment and all those young guys getting an opportunity are making the most of it
8748053 were back to playing the footy we like to play and that is intimidating a team putting the pressure on and making the most of turnovers
8748054 were just playing as a team and not relying on too many individuals
8748055 we just hosted a very competent liberty university school of law student named tashell thompson
8748056 tashell was so personable bright thorough and excellent that our esteem for liberty has gone from very good to great and we have committed to working with liberty law students and graduates every professor at liberty is to be commended
8748057 we hope this will be the bright beginning of a long term relationship with the university
8748058 we are committed to training a new generation of leaders to redeem every area of the culture
8748059 i cannot think of a better ministry where our students can be trained to redeem the entertainment industry than under the leadership of dr ted baehr and movieguide

8748067 normally it takes any fruit at least 15 to 20 days to ripen but we had information about some shops in vile parle where bananas were artificially ripened our food inspectors were keeping a close watch on two shops and conducted a raid on thursday we found that these two shop owners were storing stalks of raw bananas in a closed room the room had a tray which had a chemical powder called calcium carbide the bananas were ripened in the room within 12 14 hours due to the presence and effect of the compound in the room needless to say the bananas no longer remained organic after the chemical reaction
8748068 if you put even a bit of water on calcium carbide it generates a gas called acitilin it can also explode at times this is a chemical which is known to generate a lot of heat and gas that is why it is used in welding industry he also added that it was a common practice to use this powder illegally for ripening bananas as well as mangoes

8748075 il calciatore conteso da chievo e torino con i granata in vantaggio
8748076 venivo da un infortunio grave al ginocchio e mero rotto il crociato sfido chiunque a rientrare dopo 6 mesi e fare 30 partite posso sicuramente migliorare per dopo la lunga sosta la ritengo unannata positiva
8748077 sono consapevole e lo anche la societ che un ciclo finito
8748078 ho avuto dei contatti molto importanti con napoli lecce e parma
8748079 lecce perch mi piacerebbe giocare in puglia vicino a casa mia e una piazza affascinante e c un allenatore che apprezzo tantissimo come beretta
8748080 e comunque una piazza importante e in molti farebbero carte false pur di andarci sicuramente napoli non una seconda scelta per un calciatore deve sentirsi pure desiderato quindi al momento preferirei i giallorossi
8748081 sarebbe meglio rimanere in serie a parma una piazza importante per normale che un giocatore
8748082 inter sempre pi squadra quadrata e importante molto fisica e forte per il milan ha comprato calciatori importanti come ronaldinho e flamini secondo me alla lunga i rossoneri potranno venire fuori bene e dare seri problemi lunico neo la difesa ma zambrotta un calciatore importante bonera un centrale di sicuro affidamento sicuramente il milan sapr come fare lo vedo molto pi forte degli ultimi anni
8748083 subito dietro roma spalletti certamente un allenatore bravissimo lorganico migliorato rispetto agli anni scorso
8748084 un posto sar occupato dalle tre squadre di cui sopra subito dietro ci sono le due genovesi squadre importanti che hanno condotto un ottimo calciomercato inoltre vedo molto bene anche lazio e udinese senza contare il napoli che sicuramente una piazza che vive di calcio per bisogna capire il campionato che potr fare in questo momento la delusione il palermo che non vedo a ridosso della zona uefa
8748085 io spero la squadra dove non giocher a parte gli scherzi sono le solite squadre le tre neopromosse pi siena catania e reggina
8748086 lanno scorso io pensavo che il bayern vincesse la uefa ne ero quasi sicuro vista la rosa su cui poteva contare poi perse con lo zenit squadra sicuramente molto buona ma di livello inferiore quindi posso dire che la candidata numero uno il milan vista la rosa davvero competitiva per anche vero che le partite vanno sempre giocate
8748087 ora come ora la squadra pi forte in europa il manchester la conferma di ronaldo stata importante da buon italiano spero che la sorpresa venga rappresentata da una squadra italiana il chelsea una squadra importante deco quindi sicuramente uno scoglio difficile da affrontare nel lotto dell possibili vincenti
8748088 c stato qualche contatto ora stanno parlando con il mio procuratore

8748099 produced comparable results or slightly better in reading and maths
8748100 had a positive impact on the math achievement of their students but did not have an impact on reading achievement
8748101 many control teachers in these schools like their tfa counterparts did not have education degrees and many were not fully certified and did not have extensive student teaching experience prior to entering the classroom this finding reflects the situation in the schools in low income communities where tfa places teachers rather than the situation in all schools across the country
8748102 tfa teachers were more likely than control teachers to report having had problems with student disruptions and physical conflicts ibid
8748103 certified teachers consistently produce stronger student achievement gains than do uncertified teachers these findings hold for tfa recruits as well as others uncertified tfa recruits are less effective than certified teachers and perform about as well as other uncertified teachers
8748104 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesnt live up to the image
8748105 the smart money is on mitt romney or tim pawlenty but john mccain has always been his own man and we shouldnt be surprised by a maverick pick a real go for broke pick for john mccain would be secretary of state condoleezza rice
8748106 picking a woman like condi rice as his running mate would be bold self confident and a game changing move for john mccain imagine the sparks that would fly at the vice presidential debate between secretary rice and senator biden but the utter lack of a convention bounce so far and tied polls between obama and mccain means the mccain campaign doesnt have to consider go for broke moves

8748277 its actually calling for a reduction in the drinking age at the same time its calling for research on whether it ought to be reduced we certainly support research on steps to reduce binge drinking but as its currently framed we just dont feel we can sign that letter
8748278 theres so much binge drinking going on here like in the dorms and places where it shouldnt be happening so if it were something going on in the public sphere thered be less of a need to treat it as something taboo
8748279 responsibility for education about drinking and the habits of drinking and the morality of drinking really belongs with the family

8748281 in umts at amp ts 3g network power control is key to the mobile and network success if the ue phone set requires too much downlink power then the base station or node b can run out of transmitter power and this is what was happening as you get more ues on the cell the noise floor rises and the cell has to compensate by ramping up its power to the ues
8748282 the power control issue will also have an effect on the data throughput
8748283 because the higher the data rate the more power the node b transmitter requires to transmit if the ues have poor power control and are taking more power than is necessary then it will sap the networks ability to deliver high speed data

8748369 we and others have not been able to produce in any reasonable quantity fully formed pancreatic beta cells from embryonic stem cells or ips cells that requires many steps of educating the cells and we havent solved all of those steps

8748371 we are continuing to do research using hes human embryonic stem cells and ips cells we really wouldnt be where we are today without working with hes cells because they provide a unique window into human development and disease and we need those to further progress our understanding
8748372 these cells will remain a key part in regenerative medicine and what we are reporting today is a parallel approach for making cells for regenerative medicine

8748379 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing

8748381 is what they are doing a good simulation of what is happening in the real world
8748382 the main question is whether the activity whatever it is is educationally valid and contributes significantly to whatever is being studied
8748383 the point is not whether kids are playing with learning or what medium they are playing in a ball field or a wii setup or a physics lab or art studio but rather why they are doing it just because it is electronic does not make it any better and it may turn out not to be as valuable

8748421 the majority of the damage was caused by road submergence that resulted from flood waters that occurred during the storm season
8748422 the reliance on local road networks by regional communities meant that this damage had a significant impact on accessibility and transportation in the area
8748423 the financial burden of this natural disaster would have disadvantaged ratepayers if the south burnett regional council was left to foot the bill

8748425 its exciting to see construction work progressing on this important new health project in yeppoon
8748426 concrete slabs have been poured and steel framework is being erected and we expect the project to be finished by april next year
8748427 this new health precinct is about planning for the future and managing growth on the capricorn coast
8748428 weve planned this precinct with input from key stakeholders to ensure locals get modern new health facilities with further room to expand
8748429 the new hospital will provide a total of 34 beds 22 for inpatients and 12 day beds
8748430 a general practitioners private practice has been incorporated in the plan and the design takes into account the possibility of future expansion including the ability to accept a private co location facility if required
8748431 as well as being close to the centre of yeppoon the new health precinct is also next to the highway to rockhampton making the transfer of patients between rockhampton hospital and capricorn coast health service easier
8748432 the site also provides easier access to the fast growing southern end of the capricorn coast including emu park and zilzie
8748433 there will be heavy sledding for the u s economy during the next couple of quarters
8748434 with the rest of the world now slowing and the dollar off its lows the u s will be more reliant on domestic demand in coming quarters
8748435 since consumer spending is slowing down and the credit crunch is tightening its grip it is hard to foresee another quarter with such a robust gdp headline for some time
8748436 this is a win win agreement that provides significant benefits to fortune brands

8748441 the sharp decline in house prices persisted into august as weak buyer confidence and tight lending criteria continued to weigh on the market
8748442 we expect around 40 new carers from the region with many of them expected to be approved foster or kinship carers by january
8748443 its a sad fact that more than 260 children and young people in the mackay whitsunday region could not live safely at home because at least one or both of their parents have abused or neglected them
8748444 i cannot thank our wonderful foster and kinship carers enough for showing these children the love they deserve and helping to turn their lives around
8748445 child protection is a tremendous responsibility and the bligh government needs more carers to shoulder this responsibility
8748446 i applaud the people of the mackay region for taking up the challenge by indicating their interest in becoming a carer
8748447 while it is encouraging to see so many people put their hand up to become a carer we always need many more
8748448 foster and kinship carers are real community heroes people who deserve recognition
8748449 we need to find more people who can open their hearts and homes and offer at risk children the love and care they deserve
8748450 any amount of time you can devote to being a foster carer will make a difference in a childs life whether its a few hours a week a few days a month or providing full time care
8748451 when you look at these wholesale banks and the financial industry in general its clear its taking a fair amount of time to work through the issues arising from the u s housing crisis
8748452 however weve not yet seen evidence of a slowdown in our business volumes and our credit numbers remain very stable
8748453 when delinquencies stop rising and u s housing prices stop falling well know we finally hit the bottom and we think well be able to get a better idea of when that bottom will come sometime in the first half of 2009
8748454 theres a signal there for the market that people are putting a lot of this financial crisis behind them finally
8748455 with energy coming off even in face of a hurricane down in the gulf its putting positive tail wind behind everybody
8748456 youve got the market leaning into the idea that the next move out of the bank of canada is a rate cut of some sort
8748457 the predominant view is that the economy is going to deteriorate significantly in the coming couple of quarters and so bonds should do reasonably well with increased demand for safe assets

8748464 we are eager to see the legal questions in this case resolved by the appellate court because the lower courts opinion created some serious questions marks we are obligated to take this case to the higher court for resolution
8748465 our case is fundamentally sound and we are confident that the court of appeal will reverse the lower courts position

8748474 this year we went over there with expectations but they had a good team and we found ourselves down after the first day

8748477 we had 160 kids in the junior program this year so people know that i am out to get juniors involved in golf so if anything all these trips have helped to get our numbers higher as far as junior participation
8748478 they struggled in the top end this year but we do have a very good high school team when you blend it in the high school rankings our zone three team brought home the bronze medal and the girls brought home the gold so i was very proud of them
8748479 thats why were here today is to show that we continue to have concerns and that we are very sad about the lake
8748480 we were concerned about impacts to the wildlife impacts to the fishery impacts to the water quality and we tried to voice those concerns to our mp our mla the developer the r m various levels of governments a variety of departments to talk about our concerns
8748481 and the thing is weve gone through all the hoops got all the approvals and everything basically what it looks like is people are thinking its their lake and nobody else should be here
8748482 if anything were trying to protect it the resource we bought 41 acres were only developing 11 the other 30 acres is all environmental reserve i dont know how many other developers would have done that

8748485 open letter to the secretary general of the united nations
8748486 it feels great i was really happy that our teachers were recognized for everything that they do i thought it was great
8748487 i guess i always thought that we provided a lot of activities for the kids and i always felt very proud of everything that we do offer i think i have always heard really positive feedback from the parents so in that way i have always thought we were doing a pretty good job however when you think about all of the schools and everything that they may offer i really didnt know whether or not we would win it or not
8748488 we have everything from window painting club chess speed stacks old time new time dance club that runs we have basketball flag football earth club we had a hand bells club this past year and a sign language club we have had craft clubs like around the different seasons so at christmas there would be a craft club that would form and then they would do a seasonal craft together we have a k club kids that we are just starting we are partnering with the kiwanis club and we are going to do some things within the community to provide service we have rocket club where the students make rockets and then they do a big blast off usually towards the end of september i dont think i realized the variety of activities until we started talking about it
8748489 a great compliment to our teachers and they really do deserve the recognition they have been awesome
8748490 i think it allows students to try different things that they may not have a chance to try outside of school time they may be interested in painting and they actually get a chance to try that at school i think it also allows us to have a real positive climate in our school and you see kids that are actively involved with other kids in positive ways and with teachers as well at noon hour they are involved in a positive activity and i guess building positive relationships with other students along with teachers
8748491 reduh tunnel tcp over well formed http creating a full tcp circuit
8748492 they were selling it it was a deal you could get one for three or two for five
8748493 i dont think anything racist is a joke i dont think its a funny subject
8748494 we will beat sen obama on the issues not on a sick sense of humor
8748495 its done as far as im concerned its been overblown i dont want to beat up sincere volunteers who thought they were doing something funny bad judgment
8748496 you never know who was who it was always just a bunch of people
8748497 the police would come and as soon as they leave the same thing would be right back
8748498 in 1997 98 the borbidge government spent only 1 100 per capita
8748499 we are spending a record 17 billion on infrastructure this financial year on roads and dams schools and housing health and drought proofing projects up 3 billion or 26 on last year while in 1997 98 the borbidge government spent only 3 79b
8748500 public works is project managing health projects including the new 1 1 billion gold coast hospital 446 million cairns hospital 405 million mackay hospital 74 million rockhampton hospital redevelopment and the 21 million yeppoon hospital
8748501 other major projects on our books include the 600 million supreme and district courts building the 82 million state tennis centre the 63 3 million tank street bridge and the 45 5 boggo road urban village
8748502 the bligh government recognizes that in order to keep queensland growing investment in building and rebuilding infrastructure is vital
8748503 look at the track record of the liberals and nationals when they were slash in government they froze spending on health infrastructure and moved funding between projects usually to ones in their own electorate
8748504 the rockhampton hospital is a perfect example mike horan when health minister took money away from rockhampton hospital and put it into the toowoomba hospital
8748505 mike horan still sits on the liberal national party frontbench and would be a minister at the cabinet table again if his party was elected
8748506 queenslanders deserve a government that wont take a hap hazard approach to building infrastructure and they already have that in the bligh government
8748507 handling over 2 5 million customer contacts in 2007 08 smart service queensland is multi pronged service providing queenslanders with simple and convenient phone access to hundreds of government services
8748508 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
8748509 we would have liked to have pursued a partnership in that area with russia
8748510 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8748511 continued support for georgias sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders
8748512 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8748513 respect and support for the democratic and legitimate government of georgia as we pursue a peaceful durable solution to this conflict
8748514 europe the united states and other leaders around the world will make the case to russia that this is a very short sighted decision on their part and its forced them to take a step back with respect to their relations with the rest of the world and that step back has costs and consequences
8748515 america has sent in large amounts of humanitarian aid along with a clear message to the people of georgia we support their democracy and well work with our allies to ensure georgias territorial integrity as a free and independent nation
8748516 the georgian people won their freedom after years of tyranny and they can count on the friendship of the united states
8748517 its very important for humanitarian supplies to get to the people who need them in the region and well continue to have discussions with countries including russia in terms of how to best facilitate getting that assistance into those areas where the needs are the greatest
8748518 one of the cornerstones of our approach to delivering quality health services to rural queensland is to have a highly trained and properly prepared workforce
8748519 it doesnt matter if people live in the brisbane cbd or birdsville they have a right to quality health care but providing this care to rural and remote areas needs special services delivered by special people
8748520 allied health professionals are a vital part of the service delivery team and we not only have to attract more of them we have to make it attractive for them to work and remain in rural areas
8748521 queensland health also has a number of schemes designed to expose allied health students to a range of clinical experience that can only be gained through service outside the metropolitan and major regional centres
8748522 these include the rural and remote scholarship scheme the allied health area of priority scholarship scheme and the allied health clinical placement subsidy scheme
8748523 we have recognised the vital importance allied health professionals play in the delivery of health services in rural and remote communities the demand for their services is growing and will continue to grow as more and more emphasis is placed on primary health care and preventative care
8748524 abkhazia and south ossetia are a part of the internationally recognized borders of georgia and its going to remain so
8748525 the territorial integrity and borders of georgia must be respected just as those of russia or any other country
8748526 the six point agreement offered a peaceful way forward to resolve the conflict
8748527 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point agreement
8748528 russia still violating cease fire in georgia says white house
8748529 the recognition of independence for south ossetia and abkhazia violates fundamental osce principles
8748530 in direct violation of numerous u n security council resolutions regarding georgias territorial integrity resolutions that russia itself has endorsed
8748531 call s into question russias commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8748532 this is in violation of the principle of territorial integrity which is one of the basic principles of international law and this is therefore absolutely unacceptable
8748533 the crisis in georgia has changed the situation in europe unfortunately in a way that runs counter to our values and convictions
8748534 the lengthy prison term in this case sends a powerful message about our commitment to prosecute lenders who callously cheat loan applicants
8748535 robin snyder collected 650 000 in advance fees from commercial loan applicants knowing that he would not lend money as promised even after his arrest in this case mr snyder continued to solicit advance fees through the internet

8748697 i dont feel very good about the last eight years and i feel like were in a place where we really need theres a lot of damage that we need to recover from and we need a very strong and inspirational leader to bring us out of this its pretty grim

8748699 if you go overseas you see how much theres an excitement that a country that the rest of the world felt got so lost suddenly is on track enough to make a change this dramatic not only an african american but a man whose name is barack obama

8748752 its an unfortunate sign that climate change is coming rapidly to the arctic and that we really need to address the issue of global warming on a national level
8748753 this was a relatively cool summer and to have ice decrease to the second lowest minimum on record demonstrates that global warmings ongoing impact is profound

8748756 to suggest the u s orchestrated the crisis on behalf of political candidates is not rational

8748758 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over

8748783 the report will encourage the reserve bank of australia to be measured in its easing cycle
8748784 rumours of the death of the australian economy are overdone
8748785 commsec still expects the reserve bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week however the latest result will clearly water down the more optimistic market views of rate cuts in coming months

8748794 okay let me look you up what date is on your letter
8748795 okay here it is you sent us a manuscript of 164 oages we had our editor look it over and met with him to discuss whether or not it can be made longer and was determined that it could not
8748796 no you wrote a novella thats a story less than 200 pages
8748797 the first three chapters of a story youve written that is over two hundred pages long you sent us a whole story with less than the required number of pages also your story focuses on the narrative rather than the descriptive whereas lies the difference

8748882 we were pleased with the significant interest shown in retigabine and we have selected gsk as a collaborator because we believe they are ideally suited and strongly committed to the continued development of this important compound
8748883 gsks development expertise and strong commercial infrastructure will be critical to maximising the worldwide potential of retigabine we believe this collaboration will strengthen our ability to bring this medicine to patients suffering from epilepsy and a variety of other conditions

8748906 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8748907 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8748908 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8748909 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8748921 it is now clear what the foreseeable danger with this product is
8748922 the fact that we have put out this warning pretty much has determined that this is a product that should not be used by consumers
8748923 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc

8748927 governor romney would help shore up mccains perceived lack of economic experience

8748929 all the mccain folks need to say is look what the alternative will be and that will scare up the base

8748931 he refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him he is making incoherent statements hes also making statements such as shoot cops kill cops things like that so there was cause for concern to the officers
8748932 we called the police my wife was afraid he was going to get ran over or hit
8748933 he looked a little agitated but other than that he didnt look to be falling down drunk or anything like that
8748934 according to the doctors all injuries are consistent with a fall
8748935 they tested his system he was clean of drugs and alcohol we dont know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything
8748936 im not an officer but i dont see the reason for tasering somebody laying there with a broken back i dont consider that a threat
8748937 the tasering increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation

8748945 mi confido io ho sempre seguito quel messale per quale ragione oggi devo cambiare
8748946 non per motivi di supponenza o di arroganza ma perche riteneva che la tradizione sacra della chiesa fosse da salvare e tutelare considerava infatti il latino una lingua meravigliosa il linguaggio universale della chiesa il collante e pensava che cambiarlo forse avrebbe causato lacerazioni
8748947 padre pio conclude pandiscia celebrava la messa alla sua maniera cioe conforme ai canoni della chiesa pero si vedeva che sentiva limportanza del gesto che stava compiendo non ho timore ad affermare che specie durante la consacrazione cadeva come in trance mistica

8749218 the study has shown for the first time that metabolic response to brain tumor treatment can be detected earlier and faster by metabolic imaging instead of through structural imaging or assessment of the neurological status of a patient
8749219 frequent use of this type of imaging may be a useful tool to follow a patients response to chemotherapy for malignant brain tumors
8749220 it gives us the ability to identify treatment failure early and more time to alter a patients treatment plan before the disease progresses

8749235 these bowl shaped depressions reflect the former location of relatively pure glacier ice
8749236 this late stage snow could accumulate in depressions on the crater wall and in favorable microclimate settings melt to produce the observed gullies and fans

8749240 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous
8749241 for the first time we have a student who is using linguistic tools that have normally been applied to humans now being applied to non humans this is a move toward using the kinds of methodology that are appropriate in ape language based on 1993 monograph language comprehension in ape and child
8749242 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8749243 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8749244 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8749245 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives
8749246 she was using language to get at what she wanted
8749247 she is very very clever and is fully capable of following the conversation the same way a human does this tells me that panbanishas knowledge of language is far beyond understanding the words to understanding how to use them in a conversation to get what she wants
8749248 one of the things janni has affirmed and affirmed in a way the lay person can understand is the aspect of turn taking if there is anything universal in human language its turn of talk
8749249 the fact that panbanisha has done this and its accessible even to an untrained reviewer i think is an important aspect of her paper she has looked at the whole social action and the meaning ideational flow going back and forth is obvious
8749250 originally repetition was thought of something that happens normally in human language
8749251 traditionally repetition in ape communicative behaviors is assumed to be proof that they dont have language its a kind of dichotomy or unfairness
8749252 hers will be the first ph d produced in ape language since the research moved to iowa
8749253 janni is an important part of the future and she will help carry ape language research further

8749356 senator obama has a job to do out there tonight
8749357 which is to go out there and let the american people know where he comes from where he wants to take this country and lend some specificity to what exactly his plans are when it comes to tax cuts and health care and responsibly ending the war in iraq hes going to talk about all of those things in pretty clear terms
8749358 barack obama is the best speechmaker in politics today so if theres anyone who can deliver with this much expectation its him
8749359 it looks like they are getting ready for the emperor to arrive dont you think
8749360 and it feeds into the notion of its a big production a lot of entertainment a lot of hoopla and i think with the roman columns and the facade it is perfect because the facade is for production purposes but there is not much behind it and thats a perfect metaphor for barack obamas readiness to be president of the united states
8749361 we want to travel so we have to pay the price

8749365 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8749366 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8749367 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8749368 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8749369 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop
8749370 we would much prefer to design a vehicle that provides good protection for unbelted occupants but is tuned specifically to protect occupants that are doing what theyre supposed to be doing
8749371 its very difficult for governments that have had a specific regulation on their books for many years to suddenly decide to change
8749372 the problem is due to interference from outside the region and it is also due to the actions of georgian leaders we believe that if other countries did not interfere then the peoples of this region would live peacefully
8749373 we think georgias leaders should be more in control of the situation and they should stop countries from outside the region from interfering
8749374 all countries from outside the region not to interfere and countries in the region to resolve these issues
8749375 some western powers by encouraging certain political forces and countries and calling on them to join military agreements are harming integration in the region and are creating tension in relations between neighboring countries

8749411 it almost feels like a zombie at this point its the walking dead its such an abrupt end to what was e3 which had been this huge escalating arms race
8749412 i understand why they really pulled the plug on the big e3
8749413 right now were in this kind of dicey do we have an event what event is it which one do we go to i think were in an uncomfortable transition zone when really the real e3 died a couple of years ago

8749436 its official barack obama has received no bounce in voter support out of his selection of sen joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate

8749449 i completely support breastfeeding and i think breast milk is the perfect food and the healthiest way to nourish an infant however were finding so many mothers are vitamin d deficient themselves that the milk is therefore deficient so many babies cant keep their levels up

8749460 usually if you can establish a guy quick enough then you can get your unit used to that guys rhythm because you want to hit the line at the right time
8749461 if one guy does it one way and another guy does it another you might find yourself being offsides or being too far behind the ball when its kicked you lose the ability to get down the field further and cover the kick so you really would like to nail it down and then just rep rep rep rep with that team with that kid but weve just not been able to do that no one man has separated himself from the group
8749462 allen is not out of the mix as a punt returner and he is still returning kicks im not sure if it will be him or ramarcus starting
8749463 i dont know for sure if both of them will get it but those are the top two right now we dont think the other younger guys are quite ready for it yet
8749464 i dont mind him doing both just so long as hes not doing every kickoff return and every punt return
8749465 but if hes taking some punts and some kicks i dont think that would be so bad but to be the guy every single time and play the position hes got to play i think it would be too much

8749508 i think my experience with zach and playing with peterborough was great
8749509 i saw a lot of ice time and played in all types of game situations while on the top defensive pairing
8749510 im no coach but i feel my physical and sound defensive play in the defensive zone are what the coaches like to see

8749512 i had been talking with atlanta prior to the draft in 2006 so i kind of knew that they had serious interest

8749590 we have reduced flow but we have not stopped operations
8749591 we have already closed the port at port kaiser and therailroad has also been closed but the plant is still up andrunning
8749592 they have sent most of us home and the plant is operatingon low power
8749593 what we have accomplished here is going to reshape the wayenergy is delivered on our continent
8749594 if we get into a situation where we really need the gasits good to have more lng terminals
8749595 if you have a little stress walking through glenwood really takes it away
8749596 some are avenging angels but most of them have that protective look about them
8749597 is that when glenwood opened it was the fashionable place to be
8749598 where he builded he planted trees leaving a gift of grateful shade and beauty
8749599 sometimes the more accomplished a person is the more simply his grave is marked
8749600 i cant think of one person here that i dont find interesting
8749601 they all lived a life they all had a story and when you learn about them they come back to life
8749602 the only explanation is that the marker was placed after anson jones death and somebody remembered old hugh

8749604 cemeteries are for the living the dead are in a place so beyond this
8749605 the industry is probably in the best shape its ever been in because of what theyve learned over the last few years

8749607 i really appreciate all of you for doing it i am not an artistic person so thank god for all of you
8749608 it is a great project for the town of castle rock to showcase some of the local talent and keep the towns charming appearance

8749613 were not after pointing fingers at any particular people what we actually just want is change
8749614 people keep saying im blaming this and im blaming that
8749615 what im trying to do is explain the range of pressures that were under
8749616 there are multiple pressure points and weve got to deal with each of them but first of all weve actually got to have an open and honest discussion about the pressure points in our hospital system
8749617 when you do get a growth a temporary blimp in numbers going up the hospitals cannot cope any more and you get this bed block scenario where then emergency department cant cope because they dont have the physical space to store the patients who have to be in hospital
8749618 they need extra physical space to examine other patients to determine if theyre right to go home or they need to be in hospital
8749619 the staff can only do so much and cope with so much
8749620 there is a whole spectre of patients waiting for 24 hours to be admitted in jason recliners chairs and being forced to go into wards in x ray rooms and waiting rooms shows that townsville hospital just cant cope any more
8749621 i think with this sort of work overload and the frustrations of the staff over the last number of years is it inevitable that people will seek a more sustainable work career for their future years
8749622 its just sort of running along as sort of an extended problem here and i think that makes people quite frustrated and worn out
8749623 that tells us there has not been adequate planning that the full population influx into queensland has not been properly calculated and the impact of an ageing population is not properly understood
8749624 we get anecdotal reports of people who have been set up to have elective surgery and then having it cancelled up to six to eight times
8749625 thats an absolute tragedy i mean its an indictment on the planning of health services in queensland
8749626 the balance between elective demand and emergency demand is something we and the staff of the hospital spend a considerable energy ensuring that we get the balances close to right as we can so in a time like this where the emergency demand increases then we look to how we can perhaps look to some of our elective patients
8749627 the design of the toowoomba hospital is such that we have a number of areas that we can open a surge capacity if you like
8749628 were fortunate to be able to do that and flex up the number of beds that we are able to open when demand is as it is now
8749629 afghan national security forces ansf and coalition forces killed over 100 insurgents during combat operations in helmand province between august 25 and 28
8749630 ansf and coalition forces were conducting security patrols in the province when they were attacked multiple times by insurgents using small arms rocket propelled grenade and mortar fire sparking numerous engagements
8749631 heavy casualties were inflicted during fierce fighting between afghan soldiers and insurgents but the exact number of casualties is not known
8749632 twelve dead bodies of the insurgents were left on the battlefield
8749633 its different from hyde park or central park because we dont have as much water
8749634 but it is surrounded by a lot of housing and that housing will develop and increase so i dont think its unfair to say this is comparable to hyde park or central park

8749636 i am thrilled with our eighth and most eclectic season to date we are continuing our deep voyage into the american psyche which i find fascinating a psyche that seems to move backward and forward simultaneously exploring this theme we have two exhilarating productions to offer this season irwin shaws bury the dead is a classic american anti war play that although written in 1936 remarkably feels as if it was written today given the global and domestic pressures currently facing our country ellen weiss and s original musical being audrey is a fascinating look into the joys and pitfalls of americas favorite pastime hollywood icon worship both productions investigate answers to the ongoing american questions how did we get here and where are we going

8749642 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8749643 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8749644 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8749645 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8749646 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8749647 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8749648 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8749650 two years ago they didnt even show up i dont even know if they were in the state
8749651 now were trying to figure out what to do with all this
8749652 the auto companies also did a lousy job marketing them
8749653 they thought these things were going to sell themselves federal fleets state fleets municipal fleets are going to have to buy them
8749654 there arent enough cars out there to justify putting one of these things up on your own
8749655 and the value propositions are out there that it shouldnt be big news or surprising that were exploring natural gas
8749656 write down the revelation and make it plain on tablets so that a herald a may run with it
8749657 i am convinced they were responsible the only thing i lament is that they didnt have a little pity on us to tell us what really happened what they did with guillermo where he is that causes us much sadness there is always that sensation that were missing something
8749658 i dont believe in violence as a mechanism to impose anything
8749659 i hope that all the families of victims who have not had a judgment will be able to identify with this i hope the condemned live a long time

8749666 our officers are trained to use techniques and tactics that will ensure their safety since no matter how much investigative work is done they can never be 100 percent certain about the potential dangers that lie on the other side of a door
8749667 the metropolitan police department takes any allegations raised against the department seriously and this matter is under investigation by internal affairs
8749668 ive been doing this s a lot drinking driving and crashing
8749669 one is too much for me as i shouldnt even be drinking
8749670 its all right to discuss ways to improve the plan or actualize the plan or even modify the plan you can certainly pay consultants or facilitators to help set up a strategic plan or improve the one you already have in place but the nonprofit sector currently has little room for questioning the usefulness of the strategic planning process itself its time to challenge that reality

8749676 we understand our sweet spot is value which is a great place to be in the current environment
8749677 we will continue to be very aggressive at the key events and holidays
8749678 while it was a difficult quarter we were successful in reducing our domestic inventory levels by 500 million which should lead to lower markdowns and favorably impact our gross margin rates in the second half
8749679 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8749680 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8749681 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8749682 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8749683 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8749684 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8749685 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8749686 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8749687 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8749688 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity

8749702 the revised gdp figure is certainly not a bad thing but it is an imprecise estimate of the true health of the economy gdp could turn negative in the second half
8749703 the gdp figure may not say it but this country is still in trouble corporate profits have fallen for four consecutive quarters companies have fired 60 000 workers a month in the past seven months and the outlook for the economy is pretty grim
8749704 what we want to do and what is right to do at this point is for us to look at a full range of options not to just presume the way weve done it so far is the right way to do it

8749708 the global economic downturn is presenting car manufacturing with tough challenges toyotas response has been to take a longer term view of the market and make adjustments now to position it for future recovery
8749709 the business environment is rapidly becoming more difficult things remain very uncertain not just in the us but in emerging countries and resource rich nations as well we cannot be optimistic now
8749710 we are holding on at the moment and have no changes planned but we are watching the market
8749711 but it certainly puts a lot of faith in the companys sales performance in emerging markets if those start to falter in the way some economists are predicting toyota is going to have to cut again later in the year

8749713 we are not seeing the middle classes move away from drink the middle consumer group is under pressure but what were seeing there is a migration from the on premise pubs and bars to the off premise for the average person of 35 with a young family and household income of less than 40 000 a year a night out at the pub these days is expensive we have to capture that off premise occasion

8749740 the semiconductor industry has been under pressure now for sometime but one of the fastest growing businesses within semiconductors has been in programmable logic devices plds
8749741 one of the top companies in this business is san jose california based altr heres his bullish review
8749742 these plds are chips that allow software developers to use inexpensive software tools to quickly develop simulate and test their designs then a design can be quickly programmed into the chip and immediately tested in a live circuit
8749743 unlike other chips plds are based on re writable memory technology that means that if a designer wants to change the design on the chip the device can be easily reprogrammed
8749744 once the design is final customers can go into immediate production by simply programming as many plds as they need with the final software design file the result is that a final design can be completed much faster and less expensively than that of a custom fixed logic device
8749745 while altera also manufacturers other kinds of chips its the pld business that could really boost the companys business eventually altera plans to replace the asic business entirely with plds
8749746 one area where plds can play an important role is in wireless the chips allow data to be transferred and processed at high speed by wireless networks yet they require low power
8749747 this of course is critical as demand for fast processing power is rising quickly because people want and increasingly expect to be able to access the internet anytime from anywhere at high speeds
8749748 as wireless networks evolve from the old analog systems to the 3g networks in place today and 4g networks coming soon demand for alteras products should rise as well
8749749 another potentially big area of growth for altera is in base stations for wimax networks wimax is increasingly gaining popularity as a broadband wireless access technology with significant market potential
8749750 but for service providers to deploy wimax the system needs to be flexible highly scalable and offer a way for costs to keep coming down
8749751 altera announced in july that during the second quarter it racked up sales of 359 9 million up 13 from the second quarter of 2007 second quarter net income was 98 0 million up 43 compared with the second quarter of 2007
8749752 as the company develops new products and sells into new markets i think the profitability outlook will improve further i expect operating eps of 1 29 in 2009 compared to an estimated 1 19 in 2008
8749753 the company has done a great job of keeping costs down while focusing on its faster growing businesses sales continue to rise margins are strong there is very little debt and management is buying back stock
8749754 this is a fast growing chip company in a fast growing segment the industry i think shares should do very well especially if a market rebound is ahead i recommend buying shares of altr at current levels

8749776 this is the first human study to show that the fat in obese people is sick meaning that it does not function as it should
8749777 the bad health effects associated with obesity are probably not caused by the extra fat itself
8749778 they probably result from the constant overloading of the system with excess calories
8749779 people have all kinds of theories about why bariatric surgery works the way it does but the most simple and straightforward explanation is that the dramatic and immediate reduction in caloric intake is responsible for this improvement
8749780 we know it exists but we dont have a good molecular explanation for it studies like this one provide important clues

8749782 the resistance to this in the scientific community is enormous

8749784 this is a long term project starting from the beginning of where we have data
8749785 all of this is contextualized with our current research and larger programs such as forgiveness research the students are looking at the earlier data while investigators are looking at new data
8749786 this paper serves as an investigation into the early ontogeny of these kinds of competencies
8749787 these papers will eventually be assembled in a larger volume to look at issues in the development of forgiveness and other cultural dimensions of the apes lives

8749793 we strongly recommend restrictions in the use of thiazolidinediones the class of drugs and question the rationale for leaving rosiglitazone on the market
8749794 at this time justification for use of thiazolidinediones is very weak to non existent
8749795 further compound their already increased risk of developing ischemic heart disease
8749796 represent conditions that are major precursors of congestive heart failure
8749797 we reported in the journal diabetes care in june 2007 that thiazolidinediones doubled the risk of congestive heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes
8749798 the increased heart failure appears to be a class effect

8749917 mme 2008 is another important milestone for the honda malaysia racing team we are very proud to note that this year we are finally a fully malaysian team the hmrt team is independent in building car 26 and 27 which are both civic type r

8749920 i am glad that this year we are a fully malaysian team
8749921 hmrt is one of the honda malaysias efforts in uplifting the morale and motivating honda associates in order to cultivate the challenging spirit in them this year we are giving the opportunity to more new associates to learn new skills and knowledge which can then be applied to their daily jobs

8749924 at the present time st marys i believe is not in communion with the roman catholic church
8749925 its a catholic parish always has been and i would hope that the people would make decisions about coming back into communion with the roman catholic church
8749926 i think the church that they have at the present time is the church that theyve more or less shaped themselves
8749927 you have the same orthodox liturgy of the roman catholic church you use the sacraments in the same way as the roman catholic church does and therefore if you go ahead and make your own decisions about that then you are shaping your own church
8749928 if a parish goes astray in some way and says well make our own church well then big decisions have to be made at that time
8749929 certainly its something that i pray about and id like the whole archdiocese to pray about it
8749930 it was agreed that there are issues that the community needed to reflect on and we are starting on a process and these issues are being taken seriously
8749931 the important thing is that we do see ourselves as in communion with the archdiocese and we appreciate that the archbishop recognises the process will take time
