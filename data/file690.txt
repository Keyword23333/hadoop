6900272 certainly women arent their strong suit but the daughter in american a destructive force but shes also very human shes not nice but shes very real
6900273 thats debatable and second even if its true it proves my point you can only point to one example to make your case and shes an example of woman at her most destructive

6900287 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
6900288 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
6900289 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
6900290 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
6900291 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
6900292 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing

6900303 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on

6900306 our methods have the potential for providing early warning signs for cartilage disorders like osteoarthritis thus potentially avoiding surgery and physical therapy later on
6900307 unfortunately at the moment there is no treatment that could be offered that would change the situation
6900308 i hope weve changed the way we do democratic politics in this country
6900309 and i think it will lead to the election of barack obama as president
6900310 i think it remains to be seen but so far i feel my approach has been the right one we have a congressional majority in some large proportions in the house and i think were going to certainly gain in the senate and where were going to gain in the senate is places like virginia and alaska and colorado and new mexico all states that voted for bush in 2004 thats essentially expanding the playing field which is what this is all about
6900311 as many people know governor dean was not my first choice to become head of the dnc nor was he necessarily my second choice
6900312 but the success of his 50 state strategy has made a big believer out of me
6900313 the 50 state strategy has helped bring more people into the process democrats from barack obama to house candidates across the country are competing in even bright red states this will be a great democratic year
6900314 i truly believe that we are much more unified than the media is writing about because of their tendency to focus on the nail that sticks up rather than whats really going on
6900315 a different person with closer relationships with some people might have been able to push people around howard wasnt able to push people around
6900316 im a huge fan of hillarys and always have been
6900317 my own view is this party desperately needed to be shaken up and turned around and weve done that i believe were going to win the presidency but i dont think were going to go back to the old days of trying to eke out a victory by six electoral votes and focus on just 20 states i dont think were going to go back to that model anymore
6900318 ambience of distinction embraces residents and their guests upon arrival and rewards them with soaring architecture and a bountiful treasure of luxury amenities that ensure personal comfort

6900322 does a guy who made more than 4m last year just got back from a vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6900323 is a guy who lived in one house for five and half years in prison in vietnam
6900324 were going home our mood is marvellous beautiful we came here experienced war and are all going back in one piece
6900325 the only shame is we didnt make it as far as tbilisi
6900326 theres been no withdrawal from western georgia they are putting up checkpoints in the port of poti the ceasefire agreement clearly says that they dont have any right to block any major road or to be in major urban areas
6900327 we have to see whether they leave the administrative borders of south ossetia
6900328 its beautiful i feel a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders i feel free
6900329 everyone wants to play their part in making the olympics a success
6900330 the challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country
6900331 i will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make london 2012 a great success
6900332 thats a matter for the queen i think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve
6900333 not content to win a silver medal in athens in 2004 she decided to change sports
6900334 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community
6900335 the 2008 beijing olympics have set a new standard for the olympic games which we in london in 2012 will seek to follow
6900336 he responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions
6900337 sydney took the opening and closing ceremony into the air with cables beijing has demonstrated what is currently possible using lighting and visual imagery
6900338 the london olympic stadium will be the beginning of digital technology we see the stadium as the ultimate communication device
6900339 we have been dazzled we have been impressed we have been blown away by the beijing games
6900340 it is unlikely we will see a games of this scale and stature again it is unlikely this will be the format for the future it wont be in london
6900341 the idea of using digital technology on the wrap of the stadium is an option that is being discussed
6900342 it is early days as we look more closely at the creative treatment of this element in 2009 and 2010 we would assess the need for the creative skills of an artist and that would have to fit in with the overall look of the games
6900343 we have eight minutes to say this is london we dont want to overcomplicate to rebrand the nation or stage an opening ceremony
6900344 this is a short sharp shock that fires the starting gun for london
6900345 the london bus is an iconic image that will be recognisable to anyone watching anywhere in the world and it will be in complete contrast to what has gone before we wanted to do a show that is irrepressibly british iconic eclectic and witty
6900346 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
6900347 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
6900348 for the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force in afghanistan
6900349 now we have to struggle with the return of the classical nato challenge in georgia and were going to have to manage to do both
6900350 the era of russian weakness is over were now in a much more competitive relationship with russia and georgia has put european security back on the geopolitical map also for the us all that could mean a rejuvenation of nato
6900351 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
6900352 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
6900353 russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on natos part
6900354 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
6900355 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no
6900356 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6900357 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6900358 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6900359 we need to protect our people how would we be able to bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten if anybody is under the impression that because we have made a large investment of 15bn rupees 184m we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people
6900360 tata say they have no plan b the factory is nearly complete and the money is spent in west bengal if they start again somewhere else it will take time and there will be a cost implication however nano will be loss making at this price so tata may save some money in that way
6900361 its disastrous the real problem is the way that land was acquired by government strong arming people into selling their land
6900362 i think the real question here is whether indians want to remain starving peasants or part of an urban proletariat my bet is the latter
6900363 i think we are seeing local people having a say in the process and sometimes projects are pulled just recently 11 dams were cancelled after local protests in sikkim
6900364 industrialisation has been violent in other countries but i think indian democracy can accommodate it without the violence
6900365 and probably a bit of the big toes thats what worries me the big one is for balance id have to learn to walk again
6900366 i have no fever and i also have no nightmares so actually im doing fine
6900367 awful really awful painful and smells everything but hes still alive and thats the main thing
6900368 i hardly survived a big stone smashed my face and my arm people see me with a bloody face and they are shocked they think this is not just a walk in the mountains this guy is crazy then i start to explain that if you are ambitious there is a lot of risk
6900369 i had this drive to prove to all the people around me that i could do k2 that i can climb everest without oxygen that i can go to the north pole that i can survive for 80 days on the south pole
6900370 a lot of people didnt believe me maybe because of this i had this stubborn thing i will show you
6900371 but she didnt know anything about peaks it sounded romantic and there was media attention but then when it went wrong she was very scared and said i hope you never do this again
6900372 its a milestone you can say your whole life i was there when you talk about it you get this i dont know how you say it in english this shivering
6900373 and you are fighting for each other taking care of each other to survive this it gives you a soulmate the rest of your life you can always knock on the door they will always be there to help you
6900374 its always in the media when people are killed but if its a successful story nobodys interested to the summit this time it was all perfect and then all the way down its this big story because of the tragedy
6900375 people do think we are crazy but we also think a lot of people around us are spilling their lives by doing nothing my mother my father they died from cancer my mother was eaten away by this disease and for her the quantity of life was the most important thing she was 63 when she died for me its about quality maybe you dont get old but it doesnt matter to me
6900376 yes of course but you just have to put things in compartments and concentrate on the job in hand
6900377 you think fuck it is not possible because it is getting very stupid
6900378 first he slips then he tumbles over then hes gone its some kind of slow motion you think give me your hands then hes gone aaaah just like that then you realise fuck he must be dead then you see some movements on the glacier and everybody is shouting hes still alive
6900379 i thought nobody knows im here its bad weather no helicopter can get here probably i gave up i thought if i moved id fall there was no solution
6900380 it was just pure focus i was only thinking about surviving i was too busy to pray if i had prayed then it would have meant id really given up
6900381 im not sure if it was tiredness or that i lost consciousness
6900382 no i dont think so because as a mountaineer you know these things can happen
6900383 to build a farm we have just bought a farm
6900384 it was the most beautiful thing at the top youre looking over maybe 100 mountains the earth is not horizontal any more it makes a curve you see this beautiful round planet earth gerard had tears in his eyes
6900385 you see gerard standing there this huge man with a big smile on his face there was not a moment when we were thinking of tragedy everything was according to plan
6900386 one of the sherpas had reached the summit and the next day his wife gave birth and this norwegian couple is still in my mind
6900387 they were a really lovely adventurous couple and now if you know these people didnt survive why its very yah such beautiful weather everything was ok
6900388 hey veronica you wanna check out my fucking next masterpiece before it goes to print
6900389 hard to believe but its been a year and a day since peter josh and i published our intervention letter to palm wherein we rattled off a number of admittedly unsolicited suggestions on how we thought they might best turn things around at a time when microsoft rim and apple were really eating into their slice of the smartphone pie
6900390 forwarded our letter to palms entire executive staff and many others at palm have read it we are attacking almost every challenge engadget noted so stay tuned
6900391 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6900392 what we didnt know in july was that these cases were part of a larger ontario outbreak that only became known the end of july
6900393 the issue with that is that this is a bacteria thats invisible
6900394 it doesnt take a lot its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances
6900395 the chances of an election have never been so good
6900396 were not saying yes were not saying no everything is possible
6900397 were not ruling anything out were not ruling anything in the prime minister is reserving judgment until after he meets with opposition leaders
6900398 if he pulls the plug on the parliament without even having the members of the house come back to their seats and show what they can do then hes showing contempt for the democratic institutions and for the fact that canadians did not elect him to a majority government only to a minority
6900399 he will break the law he will break his word canadians will know how much he is not trustworthy
6900400 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6900401 researchers have speculated that tumors give off different odors but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odors
6900402 a different profile of chemicals above tumor sites relative to healthy skin the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6900403 open doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odors hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6900404 its not about us its a celebration of visual computing
6900405 no one has ever done anything like this visual computing is exploding right now no matter where you look on a notebook pc iphone car navigation
6900406 high end amazing virtual world demos that will knock your socks off herbst said and minority report like visual displays mental images an nvidia subsidiary will also present work done in remote graphics rendering a at the intel developer forum on friday nvidia announced cuda 2 0 the second version of its programming language cuda was designed to turn the graphics processor into a programmable processor engine allowing general purpose calculations to be performed in addition to graphics rendering the latest version includes a photoshop plugin to move compute intensive functions away from the pcs cpu and onto the graphics chip the 2 0 version also supports both 32 and 64 bt windows vista and mac os x and adds support for 3d textures and hardware interpolation theme number one is graphics beyond gaming
6900407 im extremely pleased to announce the launch of tracemonkey an evolution of firefoxs spidermonkey javascript engine for firefox 3 1 that uses a new kind of just in time jit compiler to boost javascript performance by an order of magnitude or more
6900408 tracemonkey advances us toward the mozilla 2 future where even more firefox code is written in javascript firefox gets faster and safer as this process unfolds
6900409 the goal of the tracemonkey project which is still in its early stages is to take javascript performance to another level where instead of competing against other interpreters we start to compete against native code
6900410 we have bugs to fix and an enormous number of optimizations still to choose from but we re charging full speed ahead on the work we need to do for this to be a part of firefox 3 1
6900411 depending on the benchmarks you choose you might see massive speed up minor speed up or maybe even some slowdown those latter cases are definitely bugs and reporting them through bugzilla will be a big help
6900412 this means we are ready for mobile and desktop target platforms out of the box
6900413 as the performance keeps going up people will write and transport code that was too slow to run in the browser as javascript this means the web can accommodate workloads that right now require a proprietary plugin
6900414 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
6900415 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6900416 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6900417 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6900418 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6900419 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6900420 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6900421 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6900422 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6900423 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6900424 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude
6900425 but if there is a specific individual who is dead set on perpetrating a crime an act of violence on another individual which was the case in this situation theyre likely to find a way to do it
6900426 paid his 2008 property taxes earlier this year and claimed a property tax exemption for his primary residence located in idahos 2nd congressional district
6900427 those taxes arent going to be due until december of this year the bill hasnt even been sent out yet
6900428 the mlv has been long overdue volleyball is a fixture across high schools and most university programs in the usa but there is no american indoor professional volleyball league for players to partake in many players have to leave the country or convert to beach volleyball
6900429 also with the success of arena football leagues professional lacrosse and other leagues we are confident that major league volleyball will find its niche and provide great competitive sports entertainment
6900430 alright guys this is going to be our last show with this drummer because hes going to jail
6900431 i was really psyched about their cd but i am being completely bulldozed by sound waves
6900432 this is not the cd you heathens play something i can recognize
6900433 i will be asking the spirits of nature to make it rain and my track record is quite good
6900434 i cant believe they are celebrating the life of this man its a travesty for all those poor people murdered under cromwells rule
6900435 the new policy meets one of our pledges we made in our clinical vision for the region to increase the number of nhs funded ivf cycles it is a great achievement that we in the east will be the first to implement the national guidance of three cycles
6900436 whenever i go out i talk to dogs and sniff behind their ears i swear ive had dreams where ive had a snout
6900437 dogs have lived alongside us for so long that we dont ask questions about them
6900438 i dont know how a kettles made but ive got one i think dogs are a bit like that we humanise them give them names and put collars on them but we dont ask what they are and where they came from
6900439 the experts told us that yellowstone provided the best chance of seeing a wolf but by seeing they meant that you might see one trot behind a tree we were so lucky to see what we did although it still took an immensely high powered lens and skilled operatives to capture the footage
6900440 i suppose statistically the most dangerous thing i did during filming was riding in a helicopter
6900441 but going in with the wolves was pretty exciting i thought theres a big animal right in front of me that doesnt realise that im filming a documentary and probably isnt aware of my earlier work i was certainly comforted by the fact that id seen richard the cameraman go in first
6900442 i think pedigree breeding is a shame when the dogs suffer
6900443 with bulldogs for example there was a direction from the kennel club to make the breed have the widest possible head and the narrowest possible hips because of this bulldogs couldnt even give birth and had to have caesareans but then the bitches didnt know theyd given birth so their maternal instincts werent kicking in it all got in a bit of a pickle but thankfully thats a trend the kennel club is now reversing
6900444 i worry that i might get forgotten for my day job
6900445 so i dont want to do too many documentaries but in terms of a work experience its been very different i dont have to wear other peoples clothes or put on make up or cry or show my bum and you end up doing such unexpected things taking helicopter rides meeting a wolf
6900446 because im not a professor addressing the camera and imparting knowledge we wanted to bring the camera over my shoulder so the viewers learn what i learn
6900447 i quite studiously didnt research too much so i could spontaneously discover things on screen the more uninformed i was the better at least thats how i justify my own laziness
6900448 they were dreamed up when the economy was better and letting was relatively easy but times have changed
6900449 i dont think well be able to rent out our workshop it looks like a farm building having to pay the full rate would make our monthly expenditure more than our monthly income and that would be quite serious
6900450 i have given consideration to the fact you have pleaded guilty despite being under considerable pressure and the threat of violence and am therefore not going to place upon you the four and a half year sentence i might otherwise have done
6900451 i accept the purpose of your distribution of class a drugs was to fund your own addiction but i have to say only a custodial sentence is justified as you are eventually adding to the misery and possibly even death of other people through this behaviour
6900452 this is an excellent day for the people of cambridge and im delighted with this result
6900453 kevin tame is a self confessed drug dealer and user who actively dealt crack cocaine and heroin in cambridge
6900454 when john lewis left the building it returned to its original planning permission for the site which was for retail on the ground floor offices on the first and second floors and residential for the third
6900455 the government target date for deciding on this permission is october 22 so i would hope to put it before the planning committee at their meeting on october 8
6900456 im sure the news will be welcomed by local retailers as it should give a boost to the burleigh street and grafton area
6900457 local residents will also be pleased as i am sure they didnt want the large store just lying empty
6900458 i think its excellent news my daughter would use it a lot its a great shop for teenagers and would be a good addition to the grafton
6900459 we are delighted that primark one of the leading uk value fashion retailers has made a planning application to turn the temporary john lewis building on burleigh street into one of its new stores
6900460 the real vulgarity is in the mindless ignorance of the rich
6900461 to spend 200 000 on a wristwatch is a defiant spit in the face of those whose lives would be transformed by such a sum
6900462 less intelligent less knowledgeable and despite their good schools less broadly educated than high flyers in other professions with minds this coarse they wouldnt succeed in the higher ranks of the civil service as heads of hospital trusts or good comprehensives
6900463 i wont take you to the park if you dont shut it
6900464 against oppression less because he loves the oppressed many than because he hates the oppressing few
6900465 the broadleaf trees were in full autumn colours vine leaves shouting red up aspen trunks crowned with fluttering gold coinage
6900466 their green issue was full of puff pieces on the environmental credentials of american celebrities yet not even printed on recycled paper
6900467 were marching to a faster pace look out here comes the master race

6900518 cricket south africa should have waited until the icc boards teleconference on sunday
6900519 its a decision in haste and we are totally disappointed with it
6900520 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6900521 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6900522 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6900523 i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue
6900524 if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support
6900525 that inexperience is a good thing for us theres a lot less baggage among this crew at the moment
6900526 we saw that in our first match against the all blacks a while back and hopefully we can see that over the next few matches
6900527 im certainly hoping that thats the case and i think the mindset of this team is extremely positive
6900528 the environment this year is one thats a little bit more relaxed and about backing yourself

6900535 when it comes to media freedom during the olympics china is not even on the awards podium
6900536 china is trying to show the world this face that they are a modern progressive country but that really isnt the truth
6900537 the real face is one that denies freedom of expression and that denies it brutally and violently when it can
6900538 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6900539 youve been learnin baby i been learnin all them good times baby baby ive been yearnin way way down inside honey you need it im gonna give you my love im gonna give you my love

6900543 they basically went completely against the input theyd received from sport and our peak body and its never been rationally explained to us
6900544 its just an arbitrary decision and you can now see its coming home to haunt them

6900561 the recent decline in commodity prices as well as the increased stability of the dollar has been encouraging if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next year
6900562 fomc is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary
6900563 maria had no time to run because he was already flying towards her i thought it was the end of maria until i heard dark magician roar in sudden ache as if something hit him i didnt know what it was it was until dark magician collapsed onto the floor and i saw maria safe and sound thank god and in front of her protecting her was celtic guardian his sword readied maria had blood everywhere on her face and she was more scared then me

6900568 i would like obama to visit his brother to see how he is living to improve his way of life
6900569 theres nothing like that sort of industrial sized company thats still doing everything in house
6900570 i could do it with a phone call but it dilutes the brand the image of the company the product

6900581 it is strenuous but the love of the fans is so strong we decided on this
6900582 between them they have had a wretched run at the box office in the past few years recently the bachchans are too much about the brand too much about cashing in on the brand and not enough about the films
6900583 the fact this number of verification measures has been taken in relation to one company when there is a developing corporate conflict between the russian and foreign shareholders of the tnk bp group over a short period of time provides a basis for concluding that there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate as well as a possible interest on its part in the outcome of the inspections
6900584 all their actions were purposefully focused on imposing the administrative liability of rw dudley alone the unambiguous conclusion is that the said officials were carrying out somebodys orders and we request that this be investigated
6900585 all the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law
6900586 the fed looks firmly on hold for many months caught between ongoing inflation concerns existing relatively low rates and the financial storm he talks about
6900587 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6900588 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6900589 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach

6900592 theyre too big to fail that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth

6900599 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6900600 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6900601 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6900602 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6900603 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6900604 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6900605 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6900606 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks

6900608 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6900609 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6900610 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6900611 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6900612 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6900613 its a very sad day its a very emotional day
6900614 the video shows that the plane caught fire only after it hit the ground
6900615 the fault fixed by spanairs maintenance technicians could not have had an influence on the crash
6900616 there was more than one cause an engine was not the cause of the accident
6900617 when we first got started we were all over the place
6900618 it tested a lot of people s emotions and patience
6900619 what we are doing is expanding the existing programs that we have
6900620 in these tight budget times we re trying to be a little more creative and knowing that the resources might not come so easily we want to make sure that we do have some programs in place to bridge students from the lower grades into the middle school grades
6900621 you are aiming towards the ability to learn second languages that are not necessarily western european
6900622 it seems to be that watching the olympics in beijing that has piqued interest

6900630 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6900631 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6900632 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under

6900644 john mccain says he loves this country stop giving him that free pass and i take him at his word but even if he didnt have bushs boys running his campaign its his bad and reckless judgments that have cost our country dearly cost us all really youve had your chance and look what you and bush have done record foreclosures an economy in shambles wages falling bad judgments that had placed america alone in the world weaker thousands dead in iraq bin laden free and an afghan war mccain ignored on the brink were on the wrong track and mccain helped put us there it is his bad judgment supporting bush 100 along the way that has hurt us all but we can change that thanks john but well take it from here
6900645 i understand how important it is for schools to be a stable focus in the community especially in a time of war
6900646 my father returned from vietnam with seven kids and i know it was hard on my mom
6900647 i think of the children as if they are all my children
6900648 i would want my own children to have the best education possible so i want all the children in dodea to have that i think we re providing that at dodea i know we re providing that at dodea
6900649 but dodea is well resourced if we have to make any cuts they ll be as far from the classroom as possible
6900650 parents deployed to iraq and afghanistan and anywhere in the world can access it as long as they have access to the internet
6900651 it ll be ready to go from the first day of school
6900652 i dont know what it was like to watch but it was fun from where i was sitting
6900653 you could run all over the race track you could race guys werent running over each other to pass it was the most fun ive had at bristol in my career and that includes the night i won
6900654 i think the people at bristol and the speedway did a good job redoing it
6900655 the track is better racing wise than it ever has been i think that a lot of the fans are disappointed in the lack of bumping and the lack of pushing that happens now compared to the way it was but the racing from where i sit is by far better and i look forward to going there

6900704 manufacturers attempting to improve both operational and corporate performance should first examine the overall structure of their business processes as a general theme we find best in class manufacturers are most significantly differentiated from their competition by the incorporation of real time data into these processes specifically best in class manufacturers are more than twice as likely as laggard manufacturers to monitor exceptions on the plant floor in real time use real time data in production optimization processes and in using real time data for production release and control
6900705 to incorporate real time data into business processes many of the best in class are looking towards technology in fact 55 of the best in class are currently using automated spc statistical process control software which makes them 38 more likely than laggard manufacturers to be doing so

6900726 la ley no es antitabaco sino que pretende garantizar los derechos de aquellas personas no fumadoras y los derechos que tienen a respirar aire puro libre de tabaco esa es una diferencia sustancial porque el fumador puede seguir fumando siempre y cuando no altere las condiciones de vida que tienen las otras personas que no fuman

6900734 he had just cleaned up and shoved everything back into the building
6900735 that to me is a direct violation of the public spending code
6900736 he took anything of value and it looks like he left the rest of the crap for the city to clean up
6900737 according to the u s committee for human rights in north korea there exists a vast network of structured institutions for punishment in north korea including forced labor colonies along the north korea china border prisoners are brutally treated in these institutions with testimonies from north korean defectors describing torture hard labor starvation forced abortions infanticide families of up to three generations imprisoned detention without judicial process public executions chemical and medical experimentation on prisoners and gas chambers resulting in thousands of deaths comparisons have been frequently made to the nazi concentration camps
6900738 virtually any state defined crime such as being a christian making a negative comment about the regime failing to have a picture of kim il sung in their house and failure to keep it clean enough traveling to china to look for food
6900739 i mean come on this is the agenda of the republicans guess what theyre not in charge anymore
6900740 weve received our first piece of paper with costcos name on it
6900741 we wanted to make it a community event and wanted it to be for kids

6900751 quando teve a oportunidade de fazer o certo ele n o fez
6900752 we lost all of our track position and seemed to lose focus
6900753 it was just one of those long nights where we were great to start and then went down the drain pretty quick that was disappointing
6900754 i feel like every race im getting ready to be cut loose almost
6900755 i never have that false sense of job security i think a lot of guys get in trouble feeling like you can be here forever and i feel like going into this weekend if i dont perform right if i dont get the job done if i make mental mistakes im going to be on that border line
6900756 last year we would struggle for a while but then wed bounce right back and have some top 15s we knew it was around the corner we just had to make good decisions and not make mistakes but i still have that same feel i feel like that im not irreplaceable that i can mess up for a few weeks in a row and ill be on the hot seat
6900757 davids done it the way that i think it should be done
6900758 he came in going to prove to the world that he had to figure out how all this worked and he backed it down and he became much more concerned about running well but also understanding they were 500 mile races
6900759 he deserves a tremendous amount of respect and accolades because hes made huge improvements and hes done it in a quiet way you can have several approaches in how you do this but one thing you have to understand is you make the rules for everybody else so the way you drive is the way everybody else drives you his first few races i dont think he got that but he did learn it really quickly
6900760 i tried to be aggressive my first few starts in this series and i didnt have the experience to back it up and i looked like a fool
6900761 now ive got the experience to back it up ive obviously got better car control and a better feel for what i need in the race car to go fast and probably have a little bit more respect from the competitors out on the racetrack and everything is just a little easier
6900762 when you have all those things you can afford to be more aggressive
6900763 its like having a 3 year old and being mad because that 3 year old acts like a 3 year old
6900764 you cant have a young driver and then give up on them because he acts like a young driver once you make that commitment youve got to be willing to see it through and help him mature and it looks like all parties did that with ragan
6900765 weve got as good a shot at getting in as any of the guys in the top 14
6900766 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6900767 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6900768 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6900769 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6900770 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6900771 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6900772 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6900773 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6900774 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6900775 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6900776 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6900777 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6900778 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6900779 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6900780 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6900781 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so i thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6900782 id gone into the film thinking why are they doing it
6900783 from the second youre pregnant they tell you that breast milk can do anything from cure conjunctivitis to send your child to university if it could put the kettle on it would make you a cup of tea kind of thing so i knew that
6900784 i went back to work albeit part time relatively early at three months and i just felt it was really important to me when i came in the door and dereks mum had been looking after darcey all morning emotionally i could push her to one side mums here now and it was something only i could do that bond was really emotionally important to me and so i would never have been able to let someone else breastfeed her in a million years
6900785 they said what youre entirely thinking about is your role as a mother and your mental state youre not thinking about the child at all these were clever interesting women and they said thats all about you not the child id never thought about it like that before
6900786 i felt a bit like a milch cow when i was breastfeeding a bit unfeminine particularly when youve got a pump its a bit unsexy and you feel disempowered and thats been the view of breastfeeding for a while youre chained to this baby and its not the modern feminist woman but i came away from this documentary feeling the opposite just in wonderment at the female body just how clever the breast is if i was breastfeeding a baby right now and you sneezed within hours my body would have produced antibodies that through the milk would protect my baby from those germs its just an incredible thing that we take for granted but because of the sexualisation of breasts we dont see them as the clever brilliant things they are not in the way that we see the brain or the heart
6900787 before i wouldnt have because id have found it a bit icky
6900788 mine i wanted to make people stop and think about whether its crazy to feed milk from another species i want to go as far as possible to be provocative and shake people up without actually being so offensive that i upset gmtv viewers its quite
6900789 the thing about strictly is the worst you could say about me was that im a rubbish dancer you havent discovered any of my politics
6900790 and if youd been on love island in a bikini i dont think people could take you seriously interviewing gordon brown
6900791 they might not after my calf shoot actually well have to wait and see
6900792 oh yeah totally you have to be really aware of that you have to stay as neutral and credible as possible
6900793 because youre saying yes this shocking but its got your attention and now i want you to think about this project ive been working on because i think its fascinating and you might just do too
6900794 it depends what you think of as pr but what pr is i suppose is trying to show yourself in the best light and everyone on the show was trying to do that
6900795 i think hes always been that when i met him i dont think i ever believed in this idea that he was no longer a political animal i think he was very conscious of not being sucked back into his old life but it was obviously all still in him and i do completely admire that even though
6900796 weirdly actually we talk about politics so much less now politics at home has completely dried up i said to him you cant tell me anything because everyone will assume i know everything so its best i know nothing and hes got his outlet now whereas he used to rail at the television screen and bulletins about things he disagreed with now he just quietly makes a little note
6900797 the only reason to employ a presenter is because they hope it will increase the chances of people watching the show thats my job so i never object to being followed even though i know there are privacy laws that say you shouldnt be i kind of think you know what that is the name of the game youre on television youre asking people to watch your shows and get involved in your life i totally understand that that means youre a commodity for photographers and newspapers and things
6900798 i just think your job as a presenter is to form a relationship with the viewer and when that relationships formed youve got to expect that theyre going to want something back as well
6900799 for years gordon brown boasted about consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst millions of people are paying an unfair price for labours economic incompetence and the fact the prime minister didnt put money aside during the good times to prepare for a rainy day
6900800 we now have official confirmation that the british economy has already reached the point of stagnation any further slowdown and well be in outright recession were now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6900801 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half
6900802 there is nowhere for the uk consumer to go but to continue to retrench real income growth has slumped as inflation accelerated while nominal pay growth remained subdued households can no longer resort to their borrow and spend habit
6900803 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6900804 we have eight minutes to say this is london we dont want to overcomplicate to rebrand the nation or stage an opening ceremony
6900805 this is a short sharp shock that fires the starting gun for london
6900806 the london bus is an iconic image that will be recognisable to anyone watching anywhere in the world and it will be in complete contrast to what has gone before we wanted to do a show that is irrepressibly british iconic eclectic and witty
6900807 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6900808 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
6900809 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
6900810 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
6900811 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6900812 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6900813 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6900814 were going home our mood is marvellous beautiful we came here experienced war and are all going back in one piece
6900815 the only shame is we didnt make it as far as tbilisi
6900816 theres been no withdrawal from western georgia they are putting up checkpoints in the port of poti the ceasefire agreement clearly says that they dont have any right to block any major road or to be in major urban areas
6900817 we have to see whether they leave the administrative borders of south ossetia
6900818 its beautiful i feel a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders i feel free
6900819 i dont want people saying how sad that beautiful hair all gone never
6900820 yes the text for the card the location the flowers the coffin im really busy
6900821 to think that this all started in that bloody womb of mine but i am glad i had it to bear you two
6900822 dad im wondering here mum is in the capable hands of staff whose authority she accepts at home shell just try to be the boss
6900823 she ought to come home it feels more natural if she dies there and i want to be around her for a bit i dont want to drive to this depressing hospital every day and leave her alone at night
6900824 we prefer not to receive telephone calls visitors or flowers
6900825 as soon as this medication loses its efficacy i request euthanasia
6900826 it should be your own decision none of us is to say anything
6900827 i think what she finds unbearable is not so much her pain and sickness but the fear of it getting worse and of losing control
6900828 the doctor had to ascertain if i was not being forced into euthanasia
6900829 i was planning to stay with some friends this weekend
6900830 and who has got more priority then your friends or your terminally ill mother
6900831 why dont you stay with your friends next week when im dead youll have all the time in the world then
6900832 when im dead its just going to be your dad and me here
6900833 does it happen at all that people pull out at the last minute
6900834 quite often i go home again and a new appointment is made but in many cases the patient passes away between visits
6900835 can i just ask you something is there still a lot you feel you need to do
6900836 i can always come back later if you are not ready
6900837 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6900838 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6900839 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
6900840 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
6900841 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
6900842 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
6900843 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
6900844 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
6900845 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
6900846 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
6900847 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
6900848 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
6900849 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients
6900850 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6900851 the aircraft overshot the runway at the eastern end it embedded itself into the ground close to the runway which obviously posed a danger to other aircraft
6900852 we got the runway up and running quickly but it may take a while for things to sort themselves out
6900853 some people will have been affected by the delays but alternative arrangements are being made for them things should be ok by tomorrow but passengers are advised to check with their handling agent or on our website
6900854 a tornado gr4 from 13 squadron raf marham made an emergency landing at newcastle airport this afternoon
6900855 nobody was injured in the incident and the raf will recover the aircraft as soon as possible
6900856 we regret the inconvenience caused by the closure of newcastle airports runway an inquiry will be held
6900857 i didnt see the tornado come down but we were told something had happened on the runway i saw a lot of emergency vehicles with flashing lights around and then we told there had been an emergency
6900858 we were sat on the plane for quite a while until we were disembarked but the flight attendants opened the doors so we could see what was going on i saw the plane surrounded by emergency vehicles
6900859 i was supposed to be flying down to heathrow with three friends but that flight has now been cancelled i think we are all just going to head back home now and try again tomorrow
6900860 ive been here for a couple of hours now waiting for my baggage to come back through there doesnt seem to be that many people to help i was going to amsterdam on holiday but my boyfriend has had to drive back to pick me up
6900861 no one has said anything about compensation but this will cost me quite a bit of money to sort out and get back to the airport again tomorrow
6900862 discontinuing the use of tokens was a hard decision because uta does not want to inconvenience its riders
6900863 as a taxpayer funded organization and at a time when we are implementing fuel surcharges and asking our riders to pay more its not appropriate for uta to knowingly allow this fraud to continue
6900864 its nice to know if you see something wrong and take the time to do something about it that it actually gets followed up on
6900865 ive had a lot of mosquito bites im from the midwest every summer it happens
6900866 mites that bite mammals are coming from other animals usually
6900867 dogs and cats can get mites horses can get mites and other animals can get mites too
6900868 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6900869 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6900870 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6900871 he actually threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
6900872 it didnt get worse but at the same time hes not going to go back out there and resume what he was doing hes going to get treatment his range of motion was good but youre not going to see him running around and catching grounders either its definitely a setback how far of a setback i just dont know
6900873 oh but im too tired i worked a lot of overtime this week
6900874 oh but im eight months pregnant and feel bloated and sick
6900875 the taxpayers are footing the bill for essentially 4 day long campaign ads for the parties and their candidates
6900876 it was to try to insulate the people who end up in the white house from that money fundraising phase where people who raise the money might be expecting some sort of special consideration down the road
6900877 with the checkoff the concept is only if citizens are actually willing to basically earmark at that time a dollar of their taxes to go to this program will it go there
6900878 certainly i think most people when theyre checking that box have no idea that theyre paying for party conventions in denver and st paul
6900879 if you look at the conventions they are still heavily financed by corporate contributions and then also get a big chunk of change from uncle sam
6900880 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6900881 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6900882 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6900883 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6900884 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in

6900887 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6900888 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6900889 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6900890 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6900891 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6900892 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6900893 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6900894 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6900895 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so i thought i would give it a shot and see if it works
6900896 i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did
6900897 i think i wanted to learn about my father the same way he did
6900898 he came hear searching for his roots and i was also trying to find my roots
6900899 i was brought up well i live well even now
6900900 i think i kind of like it here there are some challenges but maybe it is just like where you come from there are the same challenges
6900901 i would like obama to visit his brother to see how he is living to improve his way of life
6900902 i think in life what you want is what you are supposed to get
6900903 our goal from the outset has been to fairly compensate people harmed by this tragedy
6900904 our clients are very pleased with the settlement which provide some assurances of security for their long term financial needs
6900905 i got there two to three minutes after it had happened
6900906 the woman was out of the car and was being helped to walk along the beach
6900907 theyve been great the fans travel very well everywhere playing at fenway in every home game in that atmosphere is unbelievable i think its different than anywhere else in the big leagues just with the following boston has and deservedly so
6900908 its a history rich organization i dont think there are too many guys who play baseball who wouldnt want to experience it at some point
6900909 no slight to pittsburgh it just didnt work out now you come in here and realize youre playing for much more than yourself much more than just your statistics when youre 20 games under its very tough
6900910 what kind of helped me with the whole manny thing was that if i was an in house candidate and i had been here a little bit and played with him or seen him and all this stuff i think there would have been a bit more pressure to try to live up to that
6900911 but we crossed paths in the air so everything is just what i hear its a lot easier not knowing anything about him
6900912 and i really think he believed it hes been a good player hes run the bases hes played the outfield i think hes genuinely excited about being in a situation where every game is like i dont want to say chaos but where every game means so much he has been longing for that
6900913 we h old th e s e truth s to b e s e lf e vide nt th a t a ll m e n a re c re a te d e q ua l

6900915 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6900916 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6900917 while the dog is quite probably native born its highly unlikely that it meets the constitutional age requirement of 35
6900918 i am the very model of a modern major general
6900919 maybe the truth is obama has dropped in the polls so much even a dog is having second thoughts about being his running mate
6900920 i am the very model of a modern major general
6900921 i have never harboured any illusions but i have always hoped that common sense would prevail but unfortunately it is as it always is
6900922 by a court that is not free and is heavily influenced by those who are simply scared of freeing mikhail khodorkovsky
6900923 let them clean up the mess created by their fellow countrymen
6900924 marked the beginning of the mexican movement of modern social painting
6900925 an art without an ideological function in spite of the genius of its creator or more specifically its maker changes the artist progressively and inevitably into a juggler for the society of ladies and gentlemen inasmuch as the generator governs the force of the current
6900926 liberalism transformed the private forms that were complementaries into special forms almost exclusively used for the pleasure of society it substituted the wealthy gentleman the art market that before belonged to the state that is to say to the masses there one must localize the source of transformation from the traditionally social art into an art for society into an art which is an aesthetic compliment to the furnishings in the private homes of the wealthy elite and there is no man however genial he may be who can escape this reality sooner or later
6900927 intentional but the inside is equally intricate depicting a latin dripping of paint
6900928 he did not commit the offense for which he was convicted
6900929 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the uk where we can do that
6900930 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6900931 if anybody is under the impression that because we have made this large investment of about 15 billion rupees about 345 million we would not move they are wrong
6900932 there is a definite concern of being where we are not wanted and there is a definite concern about being where people are suspicious of our motives
6900933 it was the center of heavy engineering in the past but it had disappeared from the industrial scene
6900934 so we decided to locate the small car factory in calcutta
6900935 the speaker has been an advocate for increasing our countrys energy independence and for renewable energy for years long before this purchase
6900936 the ethics rules are so incredibly narrow that unless you are pushing or voting for something that will impact only you it doesnt count as a conflict
6900937 will increase the use of natural gas which is abundant clean and cheap
6900938 we believe clean energy stands to benefit from the momentum generated from energy issues coming to the forefront in the u s
6900939 there is proposed legislation in congress promoting natural gas as a transportation fuel and we are seeing an increasing number of grants providing incentives to switch to natural gas fueling solutions
6900940 the ineffable joy that can be had in pursuing the absurd
6900941 my head was so full of words that i often had trouble forming simple sentences out loud
6900942 and my speech became a curious jumble of obscure words and improper syntax
6900943 some days i feel as if i do not actually speak the english language
6900944 like trying to remember all the trees one sees through the window of a train
6900945 i find myself wondering why ive never seen this odd term that describes such a common article of clothing
6900946 sometimes i get angry at the dictionary and let loose with a muffled yell
6900947 the point at which i became bored has long since passed
6900948 human smoke the beginnings of world war ii the end of civilization
6900949 its a lot more than i ever imagined getting but id have to play until i was about 80 i think its amazing its consistency its work ethic its health its talent theres a lot of things that go into it
6900950 from a hit standpoint its going to be a lot
6900951 when i think about derek i think hell get well beyond 3 000 what does that mean 3 500 i dont know but hes still got a lot of hits in there
6900952 well do it again on sunday and if everything goes well im sure theyll probably have me do something on tuesday or wednesday ive got to get to 100 percent a couple of times before they make that call to return to action i assume
6900953 the purpose is basically to educate kids middle school and high school aged about how the justice system operates and about what really goes on in the courtroom as opposed to what you see on television
6900954 i dont know what my role is right now i am ready for anything
6900955 if they need me at whatever position i dont care
6900956 i like it here and it is much more important for me as a baseball player to play good ball that would be good for me
6900957 i am coming in here working hard 100 percent 200 percent i am working
6900958 if people cut back a small proportion of the amount they spent on holidays and kept their savings this would make a real difference to their financial wellbeing with savings rates at excellent levels there has never been a better time to save for the future
6900959 this offers two primary benefits first by eliminating the slow z axis motion the laser head can be directed to rapid or reposition to the next tool path more quickly decreasing processing time in addition it prevents the laser head from running into the tipped up edge of a part which has already been cut this avoids potential damage to the laser head or lost productivity due to shut downs should such a collision occur
6900960 hi 911 yeah its quagmire yes its stuck in a window this time
6900961 here we go the world is spinning when it stops its just beginning sun comes up we laugh and we cry sun goes down and then we all die
6900962 but i think with british ingenuity wit and resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6900963 i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the 9 3bn i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
6900964 i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
6900965 we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves
6900966 we do need to be firm on this we cant allow the olympic delivery authority or whoever else involved with the games simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom
6900967 the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
6900968 planning strategic management and coordination of services supporting the undergraduate experience
6900969 we had two goals in mind the first was to align the colleges structure to better correspond with the administrative offices of the fas
6900970 the second was to strengthen the office of undergraduate education in order to address the challenges of implementing the new general education curriculum
6900971 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6900972 i have been sick for more than a year now five months ago i was finally diagnosed with cancer of my bladder i was working at the islamic university here in gaza city but now i am stuck at home and taking a diet of painkillers
6900973 i go to the european hospital in khan younis for my treatment
6900974 the palestinian ministry of health referred me to echelof hospital in tel aviv for specialist treatment
6900975 but of course i need a permit to leave gaza and my permit was denied so i applied again with the help of human rights organizations
6900976 picketing or other protest activities within 300 feet of the funeral or burial service from one hour before until one hour after the funeral or burial service
6900977 any action that is disruptive or undertaken to disrupt or disturb a funeral or burial service or a funeral procession
6900978 protect ing the citizens of ohio from disruption during the events associated with a funeral or burial service
6900979 when the family of the decedent objects to the release of photographs showing the condition of the body at the scene of death
6900980 of the respect a society shows for the deceased and for the surviving family members
6900981 objecting to unwarranted public exploitation that intrud es upon their own grief
6900982 left with no ready means of avoiding the unwanted speech
6900983 p ersons who attempt to enter health care facilities are often in particularly vulnerable physical and emotional conditions
6900984 deep tradition and social obligation quite apart from the emotional support the grieving require
6900985 want to take part in an event memorializing the deceased they must go to the place designated for the memorial event
6900986 the funeral protest provision by its terms does not necessarily proscribe marching or walking within the 300 foot zone
6900987 the funeral protest provision only restricts picketing or other protest activities that are directed at a funeral or burial service
6900988 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
6900989 a wise man is cautious and turns away from evil but a fool is arrogant and careless a quick tempered man acts foolishly
6900990 this is embarrassing to have a girl over this many times and nothing has happened yet
6900991 our goal from the outset has been to fairly compensate people harmed by this tragedy
6900992 our clients are very pleased with the settlement which provide some assurances of security for their long term financial needs
6900993 my husband showed me a knife my husband bruised me

6900997 doch dann habe ich losgelassen werde sogar im n chsten jahr heiraten
6900998 ein f nfstelliger betrag aber die nachfolgerin muss auch die gleichen qualit ten wie ich besitzen
6900999 ich denke schon aber jetzt ist es an der zeit einen schlussstrich zu ziehen
6901000 es ist wirklich unfair dass sich unsere bez ge im alter so stark unterscheiden schlie lich haben wir doch den gleichen gef hrlichen job gemacht die unterschiede bei rente und pension m ssen endlich weg
6901001 dass angestellte kollegen weniger rente bekommen finde ich ungerecht aber wir beamten haben w hrend der dienstzeit h ufig weniger geld in der tasche so dass es sich am ende ausgleicht
6901002 ich bin der einzige der in dem haus berlebt hat
6901003 ich komme aus ossetien ich wollte mit eigenen augen sehen was hier geschehen ist
6901004 sehen sie sich an was die georgier hier angerichtet haben
6901005 sie haben die menschen im schlaf in den tod gebombt diese leute hatten keine chance wegzulaufen
6901006 aber nicht in diesem ausma die georgier haben zchinwali einfach dem erdboden gleichgemacht ich habe im fernsehen die ganze zeit gesehen was in georgien passiert aber von diesen bildern hier habe ich nichts gesehen die welt soll wissen was hier geschehen ist
6901007 54 jahre habe ich mit meinem mann in demselben haus gewohnt
6901008 nun habe ich kein haus und keinen mann mehr wer tut so etwas was haben wir verbrochen
6901009 ich w nschte wir k nnten menschen mit der musik wieder zum leben erwecken aber das geht leider nicht wir k nnen nur versuchen den berlebenden mit unserer kunst kraft und zuversicht zu geben

6901011 send rows with no matching entries to the no match output
6901012 he explained this partially by saying that he always heard the guards with his food for example but was often so much in his private world that he strongly resented their coming around and bringing him back to reality by intruding he was enjoying his fantasies so much
6901013 mr mccain whose father and grandfathers had been admirals refused offers of an early release in march 1968 when he realized the propaganda importance his captors placed on him
6901014 especially with utley and howard due up i thought maybe if i split them they might not be so free to bring them in on us
6901015 but i kind of like dobbs way of swinging right now
6901016 for some reason it just wasnt a good fit for me
6901017 me and the manager and maybe the people that kept a direct relationship in the front office with him just couldnt see eye to eye on a couple things its just how the ball rolls sometimes
6901018 as far as muscle spasms and things like that his arm has been bothering him too but the muscle spasms are the ones that are keeping him out of the lineup
6901019 hell be back and its his position ive been told that specifically but ill step in and play there until he comes back and then play different outfield positions i can move around and theyre going to use me like they can
6901020 its been up and down for the last five years and ive never been on a winning team so its going to be a great atmosphere for me to be in and hopefully i can contribute to keep getting more wins and closer to that playoff spot
6901021 weve been producing 15 000 cinnamon rolls a day for breakfast
6901022 its the first time in seven years weve had a price increase
6901023 just like everyone else the food costs and fuel costs are hitting us too
6901024 when its mandate that we use more whole grains fresh fruits and vegetables we are on board thats what we want to do is serve good healthy meals but as with anyone who goes to the store knows those kinds of foods can be more expensive
6901025 we are wondering if we will have more families take part in our free or reduce price meal program
6901026 for families that are struggling this program can be a real benefit they dont have to worry that children arent eating
6901027 we are in the business of feeding hungry children and we know that hungry children cant learn
6901028 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not

6901035 we are going to continue our enforcement of immigration law whether it is convenient for people or whether its not convenient
6901036 congress has mandated that we enforce these laws and that is what we intend to do
6901037 it seems to me ice used this as nothing more than a publicity ploy as a means to justify their harsh enforcement of immigration law

6901065 we did not want to see a recourse to violence and force and we made that very very clear
6901066 the fact that we were trying to convince the georgian side not to take this step is clear evidence that we did not want all this to happen
6901067 we have seen the destruction of civilian infrastructure as well as calls by some russian politicians to change the democratically elected government of georgia that is why we believe that russia has gone too far

6901089 state has no business telling a man sitting alone in his house what books he may read or what films he may watch
6901090 an interrogation conducted within the suspects home is not per se custodial
6901091 on the contrary courts have generally been much less likely to find that an interrogation in the suspects home was custodial in nature the element of compulsion that concerned the court in miranda is less likely to be present where the suspect is in familiar surroundings
6901092 is the place where when you go there they have to take you in

6901097 like most films devoted to the absurd kickassedness of rock its hopelessly derivative but ive sat through worse moviegoing experiences than a secondhand spinal tap
6901098 even if the films level of invention sputters here and there its star is really something to see creating a gurning fearless portrayal of americanus idiotus that even chris elliott might envy
6901099 for tuya yu nan the difficulty of eking out a living in inner mongolia is a given its the institution of marriage that has to be stretched and massaged until it conforms to the circumstances of her life politics hum in the background in the forces that are pushing her family away from a nomadic lifestyle and in a squabble over water rights but the central conflicts of the plot are on a human scale
6901100 she is not a slave no one is forcing her to sell her sex the shameful situation has resulted from a choice she made society is not to blame capitalism is not to blame her family is not to blame her tragic end has its source nowhere else but in herself her freedom
6901101 some nice christian women have checkered pasts no shit ben kingsley looks awesome in a furry russian hat so true but if you concentrate very hard and dont let the blaring danger cues spoil the fun transsiberian is an entertaining film just dont expect finesse and suffer the xenophobia in silence

6901106 its a lot like being trapped on a roller coaster a really good one with lots of twists and turns and huge drops the kind that make your stomach turn over
6901107 it in this case of course is life with cancer in some ways the life of a cancer patient becomes a little predictable but then every once in a while they change the ride new drops new twists new fears
6901108 you bet it hurts in ways that you cant imagine it hurts in ways that transcend physical pain that first diagnosis is like a knife into your heart that first bleak prognosis thats a punch to your stomach waiting for the results of a scan water torture slow agonizing excruciating so to answer the question does cancer hurt i havent felt a thing except for when it hurts so badly you can barely stand it

6901151 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6901152 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6901153 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6901154 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6901155 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6901158 devin is a proven nba player and hell help strengthen our backcourt with his ability to play both the shooting guard and the small forward positions
6901159 he knows our system and we are glad that he is back as a hornet

6901161 all of the good feelings that i had last year at westchester basically they are there but as far as it relates to the course they are gone because we are at a different venue
6901162 youve just got to go around and learn this one all over again and try to gain some good positive feelings from what youve got here
6901163 it is what it is and ive still got an opportunity
6901164 i didnt look at it as a downer i talked to ben and he thought i would be mad at him and all that kind of stuff
6901165 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like i think i would be a good addition but its hard when im thinking about that and when im trying to play golf here too

6901170 if i were god i would shut down indian point
6901171 i dont think the terrorists will go after a plant outside of minnesota but i do think they will go after one near a major metropolitan area
6901172 the bad guys can blow a hole in the bottom of it and when that happens the water drains and then all of a sudden you get a cesium fire which can be deadly downwind
6901173 by nrcs the nuclear regulatory commissions calculation it will probably take new york city and one third or a quarter of connecticut making it uninhabitable
6901174 we have spent over 2 billion upgrading things like intrusion detection systems and vehicle barriers
6901175 nuclear power plants are the only part of the critical infrastructure that does force on force we also have a better integrated response working with federal local and state response
6901176 if i was a terrorist i would tell everyone that i would want to hit a nuclear power plant or a chemical plant or chemical agriculture products etc because i am a terrorist and i want to terrorize people
6901177 you never really expect it to be someone that youre close to but after a few minutes when it started to sink in i was very proud
6901178 its always difficult when a friend dies however theres a time for mourning and theres a time for standing up and carrying on
6901179 you wouldnt think you were going to get hurt but he would hurt you
6901180 he told me maccready im going to save this beer for when you get back
6901181 he was the kind of guy that i could look to for reassurance or confirmation he was proud to go and he knew what he was doing
6901182 like a child awaiting christmas he even initiated a countdown as he got closer to going overseas
6901183 he insisted many times are we not here for the kids is that not why we are here dustin was there for the kids and hoped one day his work would make a difference
6901184 this is the worst burying your child is not supposed to happen they were able to articulate that theyd never felt this type of pain
6901185 its tough you talk to everybody talk to the family just make sure that everybody that needs to talk to somebody can talk to somebody
6901186 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan
6901187 whether the kid is disabled or unruly or just being a hormonal teenager the state is saying hey we have a really easy option for you
6901188 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6901189 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic
6901190 circumvents every rational practice in child welfare that im aware of
6901191 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6901192 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6901193 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6901194 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6901195 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6901196 we want to play our best players that give us the best chance to win
6901197 for our football teams sake its time to get ready for our opening game this decision puts more focus on where it should be now
6901198 i started exercising and i started eating more of the right food and i started feeling better i just get up in the morning and say my prayers
6901199 i think the new album is just as good as anything the beach boys ever recorded
6901200 van dyke parks brian and melinda thought this should be a love letter to los angeles
6901201 at this point brian was 65 years old and it just felt right to embrace his legend and be a bit nostalgic
6901202 kind of introspective kind of how i feel around people
6901203 yes brian had a rough time of it with his mental health but i would kill to have the kind of catalog he does and tour everywhere with his brothers like he did
6901204 when i go to the keyboard i feel holy like an angel over my head i feel very holy when we did the beach boys hit god only knows i felt holy about that too a godly something comes through me
6901205 im always thinking about melodies the melodies come from my brain and my keyboards i play a really pleasant keyboard it sounds so pleasant it makes me want to write melodies
6901206 sometimes i want to get out of the house to get away from my kids but i love my kids a lot i love my kids quiet time comes around 10 at night when i go to sleep its peace of mind things run smoothly at night during the day things are more rough
6901207 i dont talk to them very much i used to i recorded with them at one time but i dont talk to them a lot
6901208 we dont want any publicity about me getting back with the beach boys cause i dont want to theyre not my group anymore thats mike and bruces group now im on my own and i would rather do that than go back to the beach boys
6901209 the drugs i took which kind of messed up my mind the lsd the marijuana the cocaine
6901210 the only person i really want to work with is paul mccartney
6901211 a rock n roll album inspired by phil spector type records a really hard rock album that really rocks with big orchestration the whole bit
6901212 you cant call yourselves the doors because you cant have the doors without jim morrison
6901213 while the three partners had agreed to the commercial morrison vehemently disagreed and the commercial was not done
6901214 morrison had been adamant against doing commercials and densmore wanted to honor morrisons memory
6901215 they may start out with a little card table and selling a couple of things but then who is to say what else they have is all the produce made there do they make it themselves are they going to have eggs and chickens for sale next
6901216 he comes in a couple of times a week these days in fact he was just in last night he gave a party for friends
6901217 he was never here unless you came in together now hes here all the time
6901218 and then youll be fine because youre a survivor youve always been a survivor
6901219 youre not the only one whos ever gone through a breakup
6901220 do i need to get on the phone and take care of this
6901221 i want to become the kind of person whos able to be in a loving relationship
6901222 i keep it at my bedside so i wont ever forget you
6901223 i want my mail and i want it now i want it left outside my door tomorrow
6901224 well youre wrong dont ever call me again and if you ever see me in the street youd better turn around and walk the other way because if you come up to me and talk to me ill spit in your face
6901225 i look like a lot nicer person than you do so everyone would assume youre the asshole
6901226 rock this muthafucka like the hard 3 tha hard way
6901227 yeah i kicked a little who can name the most stars featured on the tv show the booncks who found this interesting

6901237 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6901238 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6901239 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6901240 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6901241 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6901242 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot six or seven under
6901243 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6901244 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6901245 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6901246 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6901247 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6901248 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6901249 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6901250 its good to be back where they have uniforms that fit
6901251 if we get what we had with him the first part of the year it will be a great addition to our lineup
6901252 a tremendous addition to our lineup and to our defense as well
6901253 were in a race for the playoffs any time you have that situation its just an extra boost
6901254 but the biggest thing for me was going out there every day and making plays running around being on the bases throwing and really testing my legs in the outfield
6901255 after all the hard running i did there were no setbacks no dizziness or anything like that
6901256 and i was kind of like you know what i think this is the turn right here and every day after that it just got better and better
6901257 hopefully i can just fall right into it jump into the flow of things just help out
6901258 its all going to come ive just got to be a piece of the puzzle

6901269 i like driving this track it is different to other street circuits we have known
6901270 yesterday when i walked the track i thought it would be fun and today confirmed that impression
6901271 there are some very quick parts and almost everywhere theres a lot of room maybe similar to some of the north american circuits used in the past
6901272 i like street circuits because i raced on so many of them during my time racing champ car in america but apart from the harbour and the buildings this doesnt really look like a street circuit because it has long straights
6901273 the circuit is very challenging but feels more like a permanent race track than a street circuit as it has lots of run off areas and long straights and very smooth asphalt
6901274 it is lots of fun to drive and technically demanding
6901275 while it might look a bit like canada its actually completely different
6901276 the corners are tricky and it took some time to find the right line
6901277 the circuit is both interesting and challenging and the final sector is definitely my favourite and quite exciting from the cockpit
6901278 obviously on the first day its difficult for everybody to get the braking points especially as it is very hard on brakes
6901279 you need to find the braking points as soon as you can and then there are some parts that are very similar
6901280 i think going into turn 12 and going to turn 17 the two longest straights are very similar so one time i thought i was in turn 17 and i was in turn 12 and i missed the apex and vice versa
6901281 this was in first practice in p2 i learned the track a little bit more
6901282 it is not easy quite challenging and also the last sector is quite nice to drive and you need to really concentrate to get the maximum there
6901283 we can say that it is not a normal street circuit it is a little bit more than a street circuit
6901284 i feel i miss some high speed corners in the last sector there are some high speed corners but they are flat out easily
6901285 so it is a stop and go track which is good for me
6901286 i mean we have seen in hockenheim with the hairpin in corner five that once you have very hard braking after a very long straight there are opportunities to overtake as i think everybody misses overtaking in f1
6901287 i think here in valencia we have some opportunities in two places or maybe three
6901288 it is very impressive what they have put together here in less than a year
6901289 the track as the drivers said is not a real street circuit it is quite fast you have run off zones as we havent seen them on any street circuit so far
6901290 this is another good circuit for formula 1 with the boats in the harbour the atmosphere it is the right way to see formula 1 go
6901291 the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
6901292 we are called not to be successful but to be faithful
6901293 we have no reason to believe air new zealand did anything remiss they did everything they could
6901294 for two or three of his researches he deserves the highest honor a scientific man can obtain but the sum of his work is absolutely overwhelming had he never lived the aspect of chemistry would be very different from that it is now
6901295 you never really expect it to be someone that youre close to but after a few minutes when it started to sink in i was very proud
6901296 its always difficult when a friend dies however theres a time for mourning and theres a time for standing up and carrying on
6901297 you wouldnt think you were going to get hurt but he would hurt you
6901298 he told me maccready im going to save this beer for when you get back
6901299 he was the kind of guy that i could look to for reassurance or confirmation he was proud to go and he knew what he was doing
6901300 like a child awaiting christmas he even initiated a countdown as he got closer to going overseas
6901301 he insisted many times are we not here for the kids is that not why we are here dustin was there for the kids and hoped one day his work would make a difference
6901302 this is the worst burying your child is not supposed to happen they were able to articulate that theyd never felt this type of pain
6901303 its tough you talk to everybody talk to the family just make sure that everybody that needs to talk to somebody can talk to somebody
6901304 sgt shawn eades cpl dustin wasden and sapper stephan stock exemplify these values and were willing to sacrifice their lives to clear the road ahead for the people of afghanistan
6901305 to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6901306 these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6901307 we just remind vanoc of course that the opening ceremonies are a time for all canadians to be included and to be celebrated as we present canada to the world
6901308 it speaks to the domestic and international priorities of the government
6901309 we have spent a tremendous amount of time with the government of canada understanding brand canada and what they are taking canada out to the world and to canadians as and were aligned with that
6901310 so i think it would be expected that the government of the day would have input with respect to how an olympic games occur on its own soil
6901311 so i would expect that their political platforms will be part and parcel of the opening ceremonies and anything that contradicts those policies i would see them probably rejecting
6901312 it is a very political event and it always has been
6901313 its not going to be carte blanche for the creative directors
6901314 the conservatives and everybody else would like to show canada as a happy shiny place like beijing has done for its facade as london will do in 2012
6901315 its just part and parcel of what the opening ceremonies are all about
6901316 they can certainly say well make it known that youve made conditions that were unacceptable or well simply scale down the size of the opening ceremony
6901317 and if people ask well say the canadian government was only willing to support it if they could have whatever they had in mind
6901318 if they had heard something they certainly would have pushed back
6901319 i think the word appropriate is key to what is meant there
6901320 theyre putting in half they would have a lot to say about what goes in
6901321 its unreasonable i would say that someone would give you 20 million blindly and say here go do whatever you want
6901322 as i said after the 2008 beijing olympics we will read in our daily newspapers
6901323 no medal again wala na naman nakuha sa olympics ok lets call for the resignation of the head of the philippine olympic committee lets not entrust our athletes with the government lets trust abs cbn and gma 7 instead for the olympics padala nila si capt barbell for weightlifting dyesebel swimming palos track and field marathon asero boxing kung fu kids taekwondo lastikman gymnastics sure dito gold medal ito real dream team
6901324 we will pray hard for our athletes the incentives promised them by the government and the private sector wont help them win gold medals we have powerful prayer warriors in our group who will storm the heavens with cries and prayers for rp to win its first olympic gold
6901325 youre right we can still bring home gold from beijing if we steal maos gold teeth from the museum the master thief in the palace by the pasig can do it with ben abalos as lookout joc joc bolante will then finish if off with a sprint he he
6901326 keep lambasting these great pretender rp sports officials all they did was predict and get a free ride to the olympics at peoples expense but all our athletes flounder and fail because of their incompetence wala naman binatbat wrong system wrong direction they should be humble para hindi sila mapahiya keep punching
6901327 manny lopez must be feeling very bad after reading your column he might call a press conference to lecture on art and mediocrity
6901328 if they will not make radical changes we will focus our money for the establishment of the national sports institute and at the same time launch a genuine talent identification program to fortify our grassroots talent development system
6901329 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
6901330 discovered a hand rendered sign inside that i regret to report contained a few errors
6901331 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
6901332 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
6901333 hold on theres a storm coming soon face down face down ive seen too many birds shot down too many birds shot down face down face down do i really want to play that song i see you
6901334 but i think with british ingenuity wit and resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
6901335 i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the 9 3bn i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
6901336 i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
6901337 we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves
6901338 we do need to be firm on this we cant allow the olympic delivery authority or whoever else involved with the games simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom
6901339 the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
6901340 the big change were seeing is increased adoption of the mobile lifestyle among rank and file workers not just the traditional mobile group
6901341 taking a holistic approach creates a lot of process efficiencies
6901342 you want all the applications running on the device to look and feel the same way as they do on a laptop or desktop computer
6901343 the business value increases exponentially when a mobility strategy is implemented across an entire organization rather than as a one time point solution
6901344 one action spawns multiple reactions to improve productivity and efficiency
6901345 you need clear policies in place to support mobile tools and that kind of work
6901346 its more than just cell phones and laptops you need a more comprehensive program to be truly effective
6901347 the watchword is caution because companies and products come in and out of fashion very quickly especially in this mobile market
6901348 what is seen as a sterling product one day can fall like a lead balloon the next day
6901349 caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions
6901350 russian general vyacheslav borisov told me that the russians will leave gori today by 17 00 and that by 20 00 they will be in java in south ossetia
6901351 i can confirm that the russians have already abolished two checkpoints in gori and that 13 russian armoured vehicles have left the city
6901352 we will listen to him but of course its not russia that must decide these things unilaterally we have a framework in the six point plan and the future developments are subject to further diplomatic efforts
6901353 rather than this narrative and this development approach that just focuses on on mainstream options we need to recognise the possibility for innovation and diversity working with indigenous communities in relation to their aspirations
6901354 i am very disappointed in the development pathways taken by the northern territory
6901355 what is needed is equitable needs based funding of remote indigenous communities
6901356 we need to see the delivery of health care educational services housing and infrastructure
6901357 theres no doubt that significant investment is required in indigenous territorians and remote communities and probably if the northern territory was a nation it would be looking for foreign aid
6901358 hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up
6901359 if you allow that then anybody else can just do that
6901360 anybody can just call for an audit of any private company
6901361 i actually want to talk to the erc they know that the coa was responding to the request of nasecore for an audit we attached a copy of coas letter to us
6901362 we are ready and willing to allow the coa to conduct an audit on our books and accounts pursuant to the sc decision on meralcos unbundling case
6901363 however the company believes that any such audit must be made only for the purpose of ensuring that the rates being charged by the company strictly comply with those approved by the erc in its unbundling decision
6901364 the coa had been given sufficient opportunity to participate during the hearings of the companys unbundling application which lasted for more than two years for the purpose of examining its books accounts and assets and aid the erc in arriving at meralcos unbundled rates therefore any coa audit at this point in time may not be made in a manner that would effectively re open the erc decision on meralcos unbundling application
6901365 was not one of the mandated functions of the commission
6901366 why the sudden desire now to audit meralco when there has not been any amendments yet in the constitution with regard to the jurisdiction of the coa
6901367 he was a good change for us from guys coming out of the bullpen throwing 90 95 mph where he can throw 90 but he has a good curveball and a changeup
6901368 its kind of like an opening day feeling but im excited its a new experience for me
6901369 coming off the all star break i thought i would be able to play third base for the rest of the year but that didnt happen
6901370 now i want to finish the season strong im excited to be back in the big leagues and playing with the guys my body feels great now i just want to go out and have some fun
6901371 i know if they throw one in the wrong spot hank will take a hack at it
6901372 if they hit a ground ball at him hell catch it if they throw a ball at him hell catch it and step on first thats all he needs to do hanks a pro
6901373 after two days of working with chris he doesnt seem too rusty
6901374 if he has any difficulties it might be on the slow roller coming in picking up the ball and getting rid of it quickly but that might be the only problem if they hit a ground ball at him hell certainly catch it
6901375 its starting to feel like its there but i think it will hit me a little bit more when i get on the field for the first time
6901376 i head out to class a aberdeen tomorrow i wont be playing with the team but ill be there dressing out that will be exciting i think thats when it will hit me that now im playing professional baseball
6901377 were excited about getting him in the draft and as soon as we get him out and get him started hell get into the routine
6901378 hell take care of his business i do think it will be quick but as far as a timetable i dont know

6901402 a city that hands its police force a license to trash the constitutional rights of its citizens is not a city that is upholding law and order and protecting its citizens on the contrary unlimited police power is a complete breakdown of the law
6901403 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
6901404 such measures also recall the repression by police and private security firms in post katrina new orleans which accompanied the obstruction and expulsion of mostly poor and black residents from their homes
6901405 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution
6901406 democratic and republican politicians are equally responsible for the transformation of civilian police into militias
6901407 the drug war has very little to do with drugs its about control coercion and power its about money america wont get sane drug laws and law enforcement until enough greens get elected to public office to overturn these self defeating unconstitutional policies

6901427 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6901428 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6901429 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6901430 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6901431 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6901436 said that if the bill passed and a nine month old fetus survived this late term abortion and was deemed to be a person who had a right to live and a right to medical care that the law would forbid abortions to take place which is just you know medically false
6901437 and there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion unfortunately this bill goes a little bit further and so i just want to suggest not that i think itll make too much difference with respect to how we vote that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute for that purpose i think it would probably be found unconstitutional

6901442 the couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller
6901443 the previous owners of obamas house say there was no rezko discount and generally via his campaign exonerate him though rezko did tour the place with obama
6901444 c ouple who sold obama his illinois home said his 1

6901449 barack obama is more similarly situated to bill clinton in 1992 than any other candidate in recent history
6901450 bill clinton was a new candidate on the national scene he was running in a change oriented election cycle and the economy was voters top issue a dynamic he was able to capitalize on
6901451 obama will correct his underperformance with hillary clintons primary votes and emerge with a much more cohesive base
6901452 this convention gives obama a platform to unite his base
6901453 this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
6901454 its not cool with the sort of rebellious punk street artist types to support something that is seen as a part of the system
6901455 obamas a rock star hes got a great brand and hes a very sexy candidate
6901456 its pretty unusual to find things that street artists and graffiti artists are in support of
6901457 i could go and volunteer at the campaign and make calls but thats probably not the best use of my skill set
6901458 a conscious effort to position obama in a certain way to position him as cool and to position him as hip
6901459 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details

6901514 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6901515 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6901516 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position

6901522 i was talking to konan and she said i should get a piercing then i told hidan and itachi and they bought me the earrings then we were going to get me a piercing at the nearby village once you left on a solo mission but kakuzu wouldnt give us the money so hidan decided to do and and im sorry
6901523 i promise ill never do anything so foolish again and
6901524 yes i do but not enough for you to have two of them on
6901525 how about this you can wear jewelry any kind but only in the hideout around me
6901526 well since they know youre a girl which i wonder why
6901527 i cant believe it either i thought he was going to yell at me but he didnt even fight un
6901528 maybe he hit his fucking head on the damn mission of his
6901529 i dont know but he complimented me and was nice to me too that was what amazed me un
6901530 perhaps he has changed for the better and realizes how badly he has treated you in the past and wants to make it up
6901531 yeah and kakuzu is gonna start to fucking donate to fucking charities
6901532 i dont know tachi kun might be right hi kun maybe sasori danna does want to be nicer to me un

6901541 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6901542 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it
6901543 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
6901544 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice
6901545 he has said to us if you need me to resign from this football club because it will serve the needs of the premier league im fine with that he is embarrassed about the indignity he has brought upon his football club and the premier league he never intended this to be the case three months ago it was very different
6901546 we are looking at taking him off the board as a director
6901547 but can he be a shareholder those are two very different issues the jurisdiction around the term fit and proper person needs to be more clearly defined it is a very loose term almost tongue in cheek because there have been plenty of unfit and improper people in the league over the last 10 years
6901548 the one thing he is adamant about is that he is not going to sell his majority or bring in institutes
6901549 were talking about friends of friends it should all be resolved before the end of the transfer window these are very wealthy friends
6901550 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice from many people about being in a public space
6901551 there has been a threat to his safety worldwide and he has to be conscious of that but i think one of the safest places for him to be right now would be this stadium
6901552 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6901553 we need to protect our people how would we be able to bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten if anybody is under the impression that because we have made a large investment of 15bn rupees 184m we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people
6901554 tata say they have no plan b the factory is nearly complete and the money is spent in west bengal if they start again somewhere else it will take time and there will be a cost implication however nano will be loss making at this price so tata may save some money in that way
6901555 its disastrous the real problem is the way that land was acquired by government strong arming people into selling their land
6901556 i think the real question here is whether indians want to remain starving peasants or part of an urban proletariat my bet is the latter
6901557 i think we are seeing local people having a say in the process and sometimes projects are pulled just recently 11 dams were cancelled after local protests in sikkim
6901558 industrialisation has been violent in other countries but i think indian democracy can accommodate it without the violence
6901559 we have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances
6901560 the crisis is if you are losing customers and we have resolved that issue almost everywhere
6901561 who is going to want to buy city link when it is losing money and who is in the best place to fix it i am convinced we can do it in three to four years time we can think about our portfolio

6901569 this man told me i will never publish you and hung up the phone
6901570 i had the most miserable birthday feeling id never make it in literature id given it everything
6901571 met a critical need for books to address sensitive issues in egyptian society political corruption and social oppression head on there was a sigh of relief in the arab world at last a book that calls a spade a spade
6901572 success can be dangerous you get isolated but if you block your contact with the street youre in trouble more than 60 of egyptians are below the poverty line i must keep loyal to them or ill lose everything
6901573 i felt i had so much power they were obliged to hear my ideas but they couldnt tolerate my presence
6901574 does not change the situation for democracy you must engage in direct political action but it changes the reader teaches us to be less judgmental
6901575 when salah was supposed to make a stand i was hoping hed make it
6901576 but he lost his courage this is happening every day giving a picture of people who are not very courageous is a way to push you to do something yourself
6901577 i love america but hate american foreign policy coming from a part of the world damaged for years by it
6901578 the cooperation between the fbi cia and arab dictators is documented even in congress american detainees are exported to be tortured in arab dictatorships and they come back with confessions why do dirty work in my house if i can do it elsewhere
6901579 his hair dyed jet black was rumoured to be one of the best hairpieces available in the world
6901580 its a pretext they wanted him in prison by any means
6901581 i had a liberal education i was a child when egypt was tolerant at the lyc e there were jews copts catholics wed celebrate three or four religious feasts this is the secret of egyptian civilisation weve been absorbing cultures for 60 centuries
6901582 great leader who guaranteed free education for social mobility but made one big mistake he left the machinery of dictatorship he was the no 1 enemy in the western media in the 50s and 60s and was afraid of establishing political parties that could be used against him but without democratic rule even if youre not corrupt you lose your vision
6901583 opportunity to keep contact with a world id never see elsewhere
6901584 didnt understand me though shes still my friend i could have stayed in america or worked in the gulf and made a fortune but i refused i was learning how to write
6901585 for 20 years arab novelists have thought that the way westerners write is best so if you tell stories youre old fashioned i was strongly against this i keep my own voice the novel is like a love affair if you plan everything you spoil the most beautiful part
6901586 language thats literary but not complicated easy to read but very difficult to write
6901587 i got good reviews but i called myself a successful writer without readers
6901588 every time you have trouble with the corrupt system in egypt
6901589 a young egyptian hears government propaganda that we egyptians taught the world how to write and says where are the pharoahs i dont see any i was accused of insulting my country which is very dangerous
6901590 im making money only because im a bestseller in the west
6901591 the government doesnt want writers to survive from their writing because in any country without democracy an independent writer or journalist is a threat
6901592 they want to keep any intellectual under pressure you dont have the time or concentration to rebel
6901593 i said its the egyptian peoples money not yours if i compromise ill betray my father
6901594 two related struggles in egypt the one for democracy and justice and the one between a tolerant culture and wahhabism
6901595 the fanatics are not real opponents of the regime but a complication of it if youre young and dont have hope youre pushed to be a criminal or a fanatic
6901596 last year the government threatened the owner of a caf but we continue to meet im proud that weve had young fanatics there some have become my friends i feel a commitment towards these young people who dont really have an education to be fanatic is to categorise people not to see the human being literature is the opposite its a very individual vision of life
6901597 was a very good student but was passed over as a policeman because he was from the wrong class
6901598 he said i hate this country this government is full of thieves and he had a point i felt that faced with a certain injustice anyone could become dangerous a terrorist because he had lost the dream of his life
6901599 any ruler in history with strategic plans from alexander the great to george bush has had to control egypt weve had terrible rulers and been occupied many times were professors of compromise but the moment egyptians believe compromise is no longer working they revolt i believe were at such a moment
6901600 you cant be an unelected regime and be liberal at the same time
6901601 what we have is not freedom of expression as a tool of democracy but freedom of talk as a decoration of the regime for more than 10 years you can say what you want but the regime does what it wants if you attack a minister they might even be promoted
6901602 theres a big difference between the culture and the regime
6901603 arab culture was very tolerant theres a category of arabic poetry about homosexual feelings
6901604 you cant defend the human rights of a group in society while everybody else is deprived of them there are 60 000 egyptians detained without charge many are in prison for more than 10 years and torture is a daily practice whats happening to homosexuals is happening to all egyptians
6901605 the stink of sour grapes is all over the arab world about alaas success
6901606 new era which cant be ignored either by those who loved the novel or by those who hated it as it disproved claims that arabs arent great readers
6901607 reward from readers they mean egypt is still more tolerant than it appears
6901608 his agents came to toulon and we came to a financial agreement pretty easily
6901609 i only had one demand given his inexperience i didnt want him to be considered as one of the two supplementary players we were allowed to sign after the july 15 deadline for signing players
6901610 so on the morning of the 15th sbw sent us his signed contract that we sent straight away to the league
6901611 the problem was the four year contract that sonny had with the bulldogs
6901612 he quickly explained to us that his departure from australia would not be simple and that the bulldogs directors wouldnt just let him go like that
6901613 i measured the risk of engaging a player who had never played in rugby union but tana was sure about him
6901614 he assured me that we wouldnt have anything to regret so i gave him the green light to contact him
6901615 he came back 24 hours later to say he had the agreement of the player to come
6901616 after the training match the bulldogs understood the player would not be coming back and negotiations to finish with all these procedures started
6901617 at the outset they wanted an astronomical sum of money then they asked us to make a step in their direction and not play sbw against toulouse
6901618 it was only a friendly match so i accepted unconditionally the following morning the tone of the discussions were a lot more peaceful
6901619 the bulldogs directors wanted to get out of it with their heads high and with the most money possible
6901620 we came to an agreement fairly easily especially with the player in person accepting to pay a large part of the financial compensation to come to toulon
6901621 we did make contact some time ago with sonny bill williams
6901622 he said to us that he wanted to move from rugby league to union but that is where it finished
6901623 today we havent signed a contract because i havent met sonny bill williams

6901697 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6901698 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6901699 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6901700 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6901701 hey after 65 years why do you need to bring that up
6901702 our first look at this region suggests we are looking at one or two generations of stars that were triggered by the massive stars
6901703 we plan to follow up with even more detailed measurements of the stars ages to see if there is a distinct time gap between the stars just inside and outside the rim
6901704 the dings both of them had we were able to work through
6901705 and they showed the physical movements they needed to show to be able to catch so i didnt think we needed a buffer any more
6901706 it allowed me to develop a very strong work ethic
6901707 i had to study a lot longer than my peers had to for the most part but it really paid off i really learned to appreciate the value of an education because i had to work so much harder for it
6901708 its incredible knowing what hes accomplished what hes done not only for his generation but for the generations that have followed
6901709 he really did change american history and to be receiving a scholarship in his name is awe inspiring and im deeply honored
6901710 i think its always home no matter how many uniforms i wear or where i go
6901711 i grew up here in my professional career ill be remembered as a phillie im not going to be remembered as a cub im not going to be remembered as a yankee because i coached there its a phillie my time here i wouldnt trade it in for the world the ups the downs the good the bad the world series the all star games it was a lot of fun
6901712 if that was the exact same team youd look over there but its completely different
6901713 id still like to see them do good i think manager charlie manuel s done a good job over there when i first came over here it was a bad team and to see it became a baseball town again thats what im happy about
6901714 i thought everything was going well i dont know if it was the way i slept last night but i got up today and it was stiff again
6901715 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6901716 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and then im stiff and its hard to get moving
6901717 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6901718 it didnt get worse but hes not going to go back there and resume any running activities hes going to do the treatment his range of motion was good but youre not going to see him out there taking grounders
6901719 its definitely a setback but how far of a setback i dont know
6901720 i got a chance to talk to mike moustakas last year and he gave me a heads up on what everything was about hes been a big help as to how to handle myself and im very excited
6901721 hes going to move at his own natural rate and were not going to put an artificial timetable on him
6901722 hes going to start at idaho falls and move from there
6901723 eric hosmer is probably one of the finest amateur players that ive been able to see in my years as a scout
6901724 he is a piece to the puzzle of where we are trying to get and that is to win a world championship
6901725 a couple days before the draft dayton and j j came to the house and my family talked about it afterward
6901726 just hearing their presentation they want to win and it seems like they know how to win and theyre going to and were excited about that
6901727 i hate reading your blog not because of you but because its so damn depressing
6901728 thats a good shot but im pretty disciplined on this
6901729 whatever decision he makes im going to respect that decision and im going to support him
6901730 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6901731 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6901732 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6901733 this is what you want you want several days worth of press you want the excitement to build and you want to be able to go out there with a bang
6901734 why does your brother have long hair thats kinda wierd

6901743 what makes you think human beings are sentient and aware theres no evidence for it human beings never think for themselves they find it too uncomfortable for the most part members of our species simply repeat what they are told and become upset
6901744 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6901745 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6901746 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6901747 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6901748 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6901749 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6901750 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6901751 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6901752 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it

6901784 restaurants like all businesses have strong incentives to embellish their images online we turn to experts and awards bodies to help navigate the chaotic world of information and misinformation that results if google chowhound and a couple of unanswered phone calls suffice to verify not just the existence of a restaurant but also the authenticity of its wine list then its not clear what role the critic is playing

6901786 it was hell both of us thought at one point that we would never be able to resolve it i was a prisoner of my imagination my paranoid fantasies where i would imagine jacques with other women i couldnt stop myself even though i knew i was doing myself harm

6901788 people have criticised the sexual life of catherine m for being devoid of feeling
6901789 but that was deliberate action on my part i wanted to show pleasure could be independent of feeling
6901790 is a response to all those readers who had thought despite the neutral tone of the book that my life was just a perpetual and pleasurable debauchery that i was making a case for hedonism and even for conversion
6901791 to all these people i would say that having and living a free sexuality does not prevent you from falling into the awful trap of jealousy and nor does it immunise you against the pain which accompanies it

6901800 come to a conclusion about how best to configure a uk trade and investment body
6901801 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6901802 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
6901803 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
6901804 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
6901805 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6901806 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6901807 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6901808 had the data on the memory stick been encrypted its loss would have posed no risk
6901809 there is nothing illegal in storing information on a memory stick provided the information is encrypted or not taken off the premises

6901817 the challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country
6901818 i will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make london 2012 a great success
6901819 thats a matter for the queen i think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve
6901820 not content to win a silver medal in athens in 2004 she decided to change sports
6901821 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community
6901822 the 2008 beijing olympics have set a new standard for the olympic games which we in london in 2012 will seek to follow
6901823 he responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions
6901824 for years gordon brown boasted about consecutive quarters of economic growth now economic growth has ground to a halt and browns bubble has burst millions of people are paying an unfair price for labours economic incompetence and the fact the prime minister didnt put money aside during the good times to prepare for a rainy day
6901825 we now have official confirmation that the british economy has already reached the point of stagnation any further slowdown and well be in outright recession were now seeing the full extent of the self delusion which led ministers to believe that everything was well with the british economy
6901826 the economy now looks set to grow by just 1 2 or so this year with a very strong chance of a technical recession in the second half
6901827 there is nowhere for the uk consumer to go but to continue to retrench real income growth has slumped as inflation accelerated while nominal pay growth remained subdued households can no longer resort to their borrow and spend habit
6901828 the uk like other economies is seeing the consequences of globally high commodity prices as well as the uncertainty in the credit markets the governments priority is to guide britain through these challenging times while also supporting those hit hardest as a result of these global factors
6901829 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
6901830 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
6901831 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
6901832 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
6901833 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
6901834 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
6901835 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
6901836 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
6901837 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
6901838 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
6901839 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients
6901840 islam does not forbid her my understanding is that if you commit a crime you take the punishment
6901841 if you are that religious you should not commit the crime anyway if you are that god fearing why would you want to take money away from other people that need it
6901842 i looked around the internet for a few luxurious minutes and vastly enjoyed cranmers blog which i intend to read more regularly in future
6901843 his grace investigates with moral seriousness and intellectual rigour bringing some refreshing common sense to some of the touchiest subjects in british politics
6901844 i take advice in matters spiritual and religious from the ghost of archbishop cranmer his blog is a role model for niche blogs of all descriptions thoughtful erudite and provocative
6901845 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
6901846 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6901847 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6901848 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6901849 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6901850 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6901851 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
6901852 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
6901853 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6901854 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6901855 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6901856 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6901857 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6901858 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
6901859 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
6901860 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future
6901861 they are characteristics of the spirit mood language and process of science they are operative wherever evidence of social change can be found
6901862 a new kind of person one who is an actively inquiring flexible creative innovative tolerant liberal personality who can face uncertainty and ambiguity without disorientation who can formulate viable new meanings to meet changes in the environment which threaten individual and mutual survival
6901863 there is no doubt that as leader of the council mr grant has the blood of service cuts on his hands
6901864 but we all know that he is obeying his masters voice and we need to show the link between his actions as council leader and the decisions of alex salmond and the scottish government
6901865 the philippine government have assured me this week that they would value visits from northern ireland to discuss such issues as decommissioning of arms as well as the political process
6901866 as northern ireland demonstrated clearly international involvement and support can help tip discussions towards a peace agreement
6901867 the action will also include the secretary of state and the policing board who ultimately retain jurisdiction under section 6 of the police act to prevent their piloting and actual deployment from the outset a duty that they failed to discharge and which we believe will be a central feature of the forthcoming litigation
6901868 because these weapons are potentially lethal police officers must be trained to the same high standard as they are for using a firearm receiving intensive ongoing training to ensure that they only use these dangerous weapons in very limited circumstances
6901869 we are surprised that the police are deploying this weapon after only a two day training programme
6901870 considered that the ability of police to honour these policing obligations could be hindered by the release of information outlining training methodology
6901871 arrests and violations of the nfl conduct code have become an unfortunate trend amongst the leagues players
6901872 and its an excellent way for us to make some money
6901873 com o le van a pagar 60 por robinho por 30 que se den co9n un canto en los dientes
6901874 im exhilarated with the outcome absolutely thrilled its taken two years and its a weight off the mind
6901875 im delighted for her and that common sense has prevailed to pay back nearly 1 400 at 81 is too much and it isnt going to break the bank of england
6901876 she deserves this outcome she never gave up and stood for justice and shes first class
6901877 we always try to provide a good service to our customers and if they have had problems dealing with their benefits try to make sure we learn from this as in this case decisions made by the department can be challenged through the appeal process and be looked at by an independent tribunal

6901892 among the many options to meet the water supply requirements for southern california is desalination
6901893 the proposed carlsbad desalination project provides 56 000 acres of new water annually replacing water now pumped form the colorado river and northern california
6901894 requirements of the project are to fully offset greenhouse gas emissions and minimize the impact on marine life
6901895 with those two requirements locked in and the need to develop new water supplies for southern california i am comfortable approving the lease of the project
6901896 this is a historic day for the state of california
6901897 as a result of todays state lands commission approval the pacific ocean will soon be a critical component of the states water supply portfolio

6901952 whats going on toxic chemicals in our toys cosmetics and bodies
6901953 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
6901954 the possibility that bisphenol a may alter human development cannot be dismissed

6901959 when such cases verbal abuse are reported we can only forward it to the education department for further action
6901960 however it would be difficult to charge a teacher suspected of racially abusing a student unless there is strong supporting evidence and witnesses who are willing to testify in court
6901961 despite the reports the teachers who allegedly abused the indian students verbally and physically continue to teach and no apparent action has been taken against them
6901962 on nov 16 last year a male teacher sent an open apology letter endorsed by the senior assistant of the school for his actions against a student and promised to change his behaviour
6901963 however because he was let off lightly he did not change his ways and this had resulted in a police report lodged against him on february 29 for abusing another indian student
6901964 the parents are disappointed as no disciplinary action has been taken against the teachers involved
6901965 he did not die in vain as he killed a communist and wou nded several of them during his final battle

6901972 it was our rumah pusaka which our family inherited now it is destroyed we are only left with the clothes on our backs but im thankful that my husband and children are safe
6901973 he would also agree with us intentions to set up a naval base in sabah i obtained all this information from very reliable sources
6901974 we would like to know how anwar is obtaining huge funds for his by election campaign just look at the posters im sure it would have cost him millions we do not want him to sell off the country
6901975 if pkr is in power for the next five years im sure they can sell the country anwar is a hypocrite of the highest order
6901976 pkr claimed that umno practises the samseng culture however they are the ones who resort to such methods as could be clearly seen on nomination day and in anwars campaigns
6901977 we are talking about the future of the country and we want a leader who is credible and responsible to the people
6901978 pas is not here to campaign for anwar they have rejected him it is just that they are reluctant to inform him of their decision
6901979 i applaud vestas for continuing to invest in colorado this time in pueblo and for bringing new jobs to one of the greatest communities in the state
6901980 vestas decision to locate what will be the worlds largest wind tower manufacturing plant here in pueblo demonstrates that our new energy economy is benefiting every corner of colorado

6902046 anwar can claim all kinds of things and that is his style of politics
6902047 however the fact remains that it is the government that reduced prices
6902048 according to information we received the syndicate had its network throughout the state
6902049 we welcome any effort to give allocations to these places of worship but it should be fair not only for permatang pauh but all suraus and mosques in the state as well as all other places of worship
6902050 the victims wallet handphone and valuables had not been taken we are investigating if he was assaulted by someone or was knocked down by a passing train
6902051 its the best feeling i have ever had in my life
6902052 all the mistakes ive made in the last few races in the last few years i tried to show nothing of them in these games
6902053 its really the work of two years to end up here its an immense satisfaction to get to here
6902054 i will try to get the gold medal for my king
6902055 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6902056 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6902057 im pretty hard headed it doesnt bother me at all im pretty used to it im a tough girl dont worry
6902058 its a dream and a nightmare at the same time i couldnt wait until it was going to happen and now i cant believe its over
6902059 in china if you fit that criteria model athlete you are regarded as a good athlete otherwise you are just a bad one
6902060 i dont think it should be like that i want to be free
6902061 agassi looks so free and unrestrained he can do anything he wants like having his ear pierced or a weird hair cut
6902062 instead of finding their way around visitors find it difficult to locate their destinations
6902063 they are misled and lose their sense of direction jeopardising our tourism image
6902064 i am not upset after watching the final race on the contrary i felt the desire for victory burning i am still young i have the potential i can fight on against robles
6902065 are there any limits to what a pharmacist can refuse to dispense

6902067 the state of washington is not in a deficit at all

6902073 if im uploading nothing and downloading 3k sex on a demonoid torrent
6902074 bandwidth is not an unlimited resource and maybe charging more might actually lead to greater infrastructure investment from the isps
6902075 some might not see a problem with metered plans we pay for water and gasoline in pretty much the same way
6902076 warner bros has quietly adopted marvels model of releasing a single film for each character and then using those movies and their sequels to build up to a multicharacter film
6902077 theres just something about holding a tangible product from the band that includes pictures artwork acknowledgments lyrics etc that wont ever completely die
6902078 the internet as a whole has some credible sources and blogs but its hard to find them among all the crap
6902079 the internet is cool but they have limitations there isnt a mobile device that can beat the size portability and cheap cost of a newspaper or magazine
6902080 iphone beats the paper on size beats the paper on portability and beats the paper on cost not purchase price of the phone but the cost to view the papers contents online
6902081 iphones and any digital interface is expensive not many people can afford a 200 phone interface device
6902082 i believe in the the future being digital i also believe that print will stay around too and coexist its naive to assume that everyone will be consuming all media through an iphone sized screen in the near future there are alot of people myself included that find something that small too bothersome to even accept any convenience it may allow
6902083 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
6902084 i missed the 1500m so to win in the 5000m is my only objective
6902085 ive just got to get ready for the final now nothing else matters its going to be a dogfight

6902092 michael phelps oh yeah that fast guy i remember him
6902093 i clicked on the jump and im still here wtf
6902094 i just wanted to know what it feels like to kill a baby
6902095 i will not give to a woman an abortive remedy
6902096 nor will i give a woman a pessary to procure abortion
6902097 im glad my morals are so well protected by the government the next time i see a medical emergency ill check to see whether the person has a tattoo or is wearing a religious icon if they are i wont feel morally obligated to treat them they can wait until the next doctor comes on shift
6902098 the point is who owns a womans body if the doctor owns it he can make the decision if the woman owns it she can
6902099 if its such a problem the doctor should get a job somewhere where he isnt forced to perform abortions
6902100 its kinda like someone joining the air force training to be a fighter pilot and then refuse to kill people on moral grounds
6902101 correct me if im wrong but arent doctors who perform abortions nearly exclusively gynecologists
6902102 swear to fulfill to the best of my ability and judgment this covenant
6902103 its kinda like someone joining the air force training to be a fighter pilot and then refuse to kill people on moral grounds
6902104 the regulation now faces a 30 day public comment period
6902105 i will apply for the benefit of the sick all measures that are required avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism
6902106 just got back from vacation on a private beach inhawaii

6902109 i think the team has enormous potential and i am going to try to bring my qualities my experience and my temperament so that the club can get back to the summit of the league
6902110 sometimes negotiations are even tougher than usual fans should be aware we are trying to strengthen up front and sign a new forward quite often these things take time
6902111 its true to say we have one or two areas that we need to look at defensively and maybe solve a few problems at the back
6902112 a la sainte rose pour le travailleur pas de pose
6902113 these homes are not senator mccains theyre senator mccains and mrs mccains
6902114 were rich and youre not and we aim to keep it that way
6902115 yes of course you are now we got to buckle down and save planet express
6902116 we have asked the gymnastics federation to look into what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies on this subject
6902117 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions but there shouldnt be
6902118 if they had not been cleared they would not have been admitted
6902119 my real age is 16 i dont care what other people say
6902120 i keep looking at my life and wonder why im not dead yet
6902121 can i shoot jack thompson now i been practicing on counter strike source
6902122 a dream that will come true is not a real dream
6902123 it is unbelievable in there everyone is totally crazy once they are out of their competitions god knows what it is going to be like this weekend it is like a world within a world
6902124 the swimmers finished earlier in the week and it was like there was an eruption
6902125 all ive ever cared about was video games and they made me a millionaire
6902126 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6902127 it will be about strategy and how we put that into practice
6902128 i hope maurits bring us luck after all he knows what it takes to win a gold
6902129 we played badly that day and did not deserve to win
6902130 ita been a long journey for me and a lot of the guys whove put in a decade of work to get to get to this point
6902131 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6902132 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6902133 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position
6902134 john mccains been living like this for the last 25 and obviously doesnt have a very clear sense of what ordinary americans are going through
6902135 maybe mccain thinks this economy is working for folks like him
6902136 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
6902137 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred during the operation by coalition forces in shindand district of herat province
6902138 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age
6902139 the interior ministry while expressing its profound regret because of this incident which happened by accident has sent a delegation of 10 people to the area and more details will be announced once the investigation is completed
6902140 i definitely do not have any reports of a large amount of civilian casualties and we dont have any reports of civilian casualties at all
6902141 the coalition remains confident in our reports that were released earlier today
6902142 planes bombed the area and in the result 25 taliban were killed including two famous commanders
6902143 unfortunately five civilians were killed and one woman and a boy were wounded
6902144 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
6902145 this is totally irresponsible of the dilg department of the interior and local government secretary ronaldo puno mindanao is not a war zone
6902146 if the philippine army cannot do so this is a dire indication of the incompetence of the arroyo administration
6902147 we are aware of the pnps intention but it should be done with extreme caution to avoid worsening the peace situation
6902148 the pnp must be stringent in the deputization of police auxiliaries and ensure that they auxiliaries are provided rigorous training for them to be effective in the anti terror drive
6902149 when the pnp provided shotguns should become part of the so many loose firearms in the country today then the perceived cure becomes part of the problem
6902150 the timing is only made now but actually this is long overdue for our police auxiliaries in different parts of the country and we are giving priority now to the four regions of mindanao
6902151 the pnp will need their assistance like for example running after criminals it has to be properly guided by our rules we cannot just allow them to operate by themselves its always the pnp that supervises they cannot operate or act independently
6902152 its gonna get worse if they delay it they should think again ibigay na nila ang mga kriminal para matigil na ito hand over these criminals to stop the violence
6902153 my recent remarks may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado river compact and commence negotiations for new water allocations
6902154 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6902155 i think the word renegotiate does not have double meaning
6902156 it is about opening it up and negotiating it again and the fact that hes willing to do that again has to demonstrate in my mind given the context of it a bias for the lower basin states his desire still to renegotiate it was really pretty direct
6902157 this is a reversal of direction but its a reversal that i think colorado voters have to pay clear attention to because on the west slope im not sure there are more important issues than the issue of the scarcity of water
6902158 day the hope died honoring the memory of crandall canyon rescuers family friends mark anniversary recall details of the doomed effort
6902159 plans to plead guilty friday to a reduced charge of desertion his lawyer said
6902160 branum said long has reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty to desertion with intent to remain away permanently a lesser charge than desertion with intent to shirk hazardous duty
6902161 in exchange for him pleading guilty theyve agreed to lower the three year maximum sentence that usually comes with those charges
6902162 i think they want to prosecute him for free speech issues without actually charging him for them
6902163 members of pax christi the oxford catholic worker and fellowship of reconciliation will join voices in the wilderness
6902164 i feel that some of your polices are beginning to depart from deeply held traditional canadian values and you are transforming the face of canada with the mandate of a minority government you also have a majority in the house of commons who voted on behalf of canadians to support the request made by american war resisters to remain in canada i believe you are turning your back on a majority of canadians on an issue that is very important to us that is not the sign of a democratic prime minister somehow canada has always been a little bit different and we have always been proud of that we dont want to be more like anyone else sir in the name of decency compassion and a higher justice i request you to allow american war resisters to remain in canada as conscientious objectors please dont send them off to have their lives and families desroyed by an unjust war your decision to begin deporting american war resisters lacks decency and compassion i strongly urge you to reconsider your position

6902171 sheriffs officials said the inmate suspected of sending the letter is marc harold ramsey 39 who has been incarcerated since september 2007 on investigation of felony menacing harassment and second degree assault on a peace officer ramsey may face federal felony charges for thursdays incident sheriffs officials said
6902172 just this morning us and iraqi negotiators announced theyve reached a deal to withdraw us troops from iraq
6902173 im sure that this will be approved by the parliament as soon as they come back from vacation and they get their act together
6902174 a draft agreement between the united states and iraq contains no fixed dates for u s forces to withdraw but iraq would like combat troops out by the end of 2011 government spokesman ali al dabbagh said on thursday
6902175 if the council agrees to the draft it will move to the political council for national security before going to the iraqi parliament which must approve the agreement before the u n mandate expires
6902176 towards the end of july after a secure video conference between president bush and prime minister maliki we announced that as part of any agreement with the iraqis establishing our future bilateral releationship would include aspirational time horizons goals for women iraqi troops begin to take over more of the combat mission in various parts of iraq which allow for more us troops to come home so any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6902177 the shiite domination government in iraq is driving out many leaders of sunni citizen patrols the groups of former insurgents who joined the american payroll and have been a major pillar in the decline in violence around the nation
6902178 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6902179 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6902180 were not going to walk away from them and as i said prime minister maliki committed to taking care of them i do think it is somewhat understandable that the government struggles to hire former insurgents for its security forces or for its ministerial positions but this is how you end these kinds of conflicts thats why they call it reconciliation its not done with ones friends its done with former enemies
6902181 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6902182 because he was deemed not to be a security threat
6902183 conventions are relics they dont decide the nominees anymore no one pays much attention to the party platforms except a few ideological activists so why do we still have them two reasons money and publicity
6902184 explores the human side of globalization exposing the many ways it uproots people in latin american and asia driving them to migrate at the same time u s immigration policy makes the labor of those displaced people a crime in the united states illegal people explains why our national policy produces even more displacement more migration more immigration raids and a more divided polarized society
6902185 at least level with your readers mr herbert tell them that you think the two major parties republican and democrat own all the voters and theres no one else on the ballot at least level with them
6902186 however checks by ministry officials showed that it only managed to overhaul seven as at last month fill up for less lower petrol diesel prices to help poor cope with inflation perak exco men demand aca and media apologise or face rm100m suit
6902187 he appears to be something different than what he was
6902188 theyre drinking the kool aid that somehow i have changed positions on the issues all i can say is that we all grow we all grow wiser and we all refine our positions
6902189 when the fuel price went up they raised the prices of goods even when we told them not to
6902190 now that the fuel price is reduced they must make a similar change
6902191 this is the best deal for all malaysians and not just for those in permatang pauh
6902192 we promised the rakyat to reduce the price but if we wait until the end of the month to do it the price could rise and we wont be able to pass on the benefits
6902193 the rakyat has been impatiently waiting for me to announce it then the world crude oil price went up by us 5 rm16 50 and we decided not to wait any longer
6902194 otherwise the people will ask why we did not reduce the price when the world oil price was down
6902195 it doesnt matter if im the world champion or not
6902196 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6902197 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6902198 the fact that the manager hasnt bought in loads of new players shows he has faith in the squad it hasnt changed much at all from last season
6902199 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
6902200 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
6902201 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
6902202 if you are reading this then you are already dead
6902203 a death threat by no means is a legitimate form of political expression
6902204 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6902205 staying on top of the situation and communicating regularly with the companies their regulator and the federal reserve
6902206 he was a kindhearted kid you know i just loved him you know what im saying he would do anything for you if you asked him
6902207 had nothing to do with being gang related or racially motivated
6902208 i think he probably stood his ground and that ultimately led to his death
6902209 he said i told ryan that someday that mouth of his is going to get him in trouble but i never thought a kid would pull a trigger and shoot him
6902210 the dude was slapping him and smacking him on the back of his hands
6902211 it was just something he had to do in this area to survive
6902212 he had this tough exterior but if you really knew him he was not like that at all
6902213 when people see a kid in baggy pants or baggy clothes they get the wrong perception of them
6902214 they think this is just a dumb guy in the projects but ryan was nothing like that at all even though he might be dressed like that he had a big heart
6902215 the warning signs that there was a culture that lacked discipline was there
6902216 i dont think anyone could have anticipated or would have anticipated a tragedy of this magnitude
6902217 but if there is a specific individual who is dead set on perpetrating a crime an act of violence on another individual which was the case in this situation theyre likely to find a way to do it
6902218 it is just ironic that that is where his life ended
6902219 it doesnt take a lot youre not going to see it
6902220 its not like youre going to have dripping stuff all over the place it just happens to get in there despite having a very good system with a whole bunch of checks and balances
6902221 i announce to you the good news of the martyrdom of my friend sheikh abu khabab al masri and his pious comrades
6902222 i have been commuting between kuala lumpur and seremban daily for the past five years
6902223 getting jostled or sandwiched by passengers during the rush hours is normal
6902224 we end up waiting a long time to buy our tickets causing us to miss the train at times
6902225 i have tripped had the door closed on me and sat on wet seats if someone like me finds it difficult to commute on the train i cannot imagine how it would be for the disabled or the senior citizens
6902226 there is no point in focusing only on the lrt and ktm komuter services as they need the feeder bus services to complement them
6902227 its much cheaper to improve the bus operations than the lrt and rail commuter systems
6902228 the government can foot the capital cost of the buses as they had done for the lrt through rapidkl and let the companies run the operations
6902229 licences can be given to the operators and if they do not perform the licences can be withdrawn
6902230 the capital cost for building lrt and railway lines and stations is much higher than to improve existing bus routes
6902231 we cannot afford to have people like this in the police force and i will not tolerate such personnel
6902232 leaves a big vacuum that leaves the radical outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly our side of the border too
6902233 the motivation is to raise awareness and try and encourage these sites to adopt ssl and do it properly
6902234 just about everyone but google simply does not want to spend the money to invest in the security of their users and will continue to ignore this issue just as they have for the past year
6902235 on wednesday i issued a press release that incorrectly identified an upland man as a convicted child molester and a registered sex offender this information is not correct
6902236 i apologize to mr stephens and to you for this error
6902237 our players came out with a lot of energy and enthusiasm
6902238 we had a lot of people do a lot of positive things but theres some things that we have to get better at and thats the purpose of our non conference schedule
6902239 we played well in the first half and were going to try and build off some of the positives from this game going into next week
6902240 there was an attempt to bomb the hunyani rail and road bridges along the harare bulawayo routes last night
6902241 both bridges where the bomb exploded suffered minimum damage and remained intact and useable
6902242 a fabulous strong clear voice a great sense of time and an even greater sense of fun
6902243 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6902244 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6902245 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6902246 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details

6902248 a year from today chellam will be dead her father will say she committed suicide after a failed love affair the villagers will say he beat her to death for bringing shame to the family chellam herself will say nothing she will have cried so much by then that the children will have nicknamed her filthyface for her permanent tear stains
6902249 every word every action every ritual i witness is a small puzzle and seldom means what i think it does
6902250 exploring peoples innermost feelings and thoughts their beliefs and their reflections on the past
6902251 this is a book with a difference unusually a realistic chinese voice is calling for better understanding of a people who try to carve out the path they desire often against the odds often with joy and hope
6902252 was a reaction against the flawed dysfunctional heroes in the books i was reading i wanted to go back to a simpler more historical kind of hero even though the books are set in the present day
6902253 to know that people are genuinely entertained and sometimes comforted
6902254 but hes very committed to his own set of values and principles
6902255 there are always challenges in writing a book but there were no more than normal with this one
6902256 david westheimer author of von ryans express which was made into a film in 1965 and starred the late frank sinatra had said i would hate to have reacher for an enemy i would be uneasy to have him for a friend and i sure wouldnt let him marry my granddaughter
6902257 the bones are taken out through the neck so that the juices are retained
6902258 cooking methods have changed a lot and so have ingredients
6902259 in those days the duck or chicken came to the restaurant kitchen alive flavours are different now
6902260 when i was a child i would throw a tantrum if i didnt have this at the restaurant
6902261 it would be cheaper for wayne swan to stand outside coles with gift vouchers
6902262 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6902263 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6902264 there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section
6902265 there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
6902266 it is all about the scoring an activity usually taken for granted
6902267 estamos hablando con las autoridades para tener acceso a todos los detenidos en conexi n con las hostilidades esa es una prioridad para nosotros
6902268 es mejor tener una industria de defensa aunque salga muy c
6902269 john mccain says he loves this country stop giving him that free pass and i take him at his word but even if he didnt have bushs boys running his campaign its his bad and reckless judgments that have cost our country dearly cost us all really youve had your chance and look what you and bush have done record foreclosures an economy in shambles wages falling bad judgments that had placed america alone in the world weaker thousands dead in iraq bin laden free and an afghan war mccain ignored on the brink were on the wrong track and mccain helped put us there it is his bad judgment supporting bush 100 along the way that has hurt us all but we can change that thanks john but well take it from here
6902270 born on third base and thinks he hit a triple
6902271 well give you a tax break to buy your own health insurance
6902272 that breast that little nipple ends up right in the shots that tvs make during press conferences
6902273 its kind of pointless to have wanted this allegory and then to cover it up they could have chosen another subject
6902274 es mejor tener una industria de defensa aunque salga muy c
6902275 texting while driving is so obviously unsafe that its hard to believe anyone would attempt it yet everyday observation suggests there are an awful lot of folks who do
6902276 i know it seems like its just common sense regrettably common sense isnt always that common
6902277 the governor told legislators at the beginning at the month he will veto any legislation that comes to his desk that is unrelated to the budget
6902278 all of their focus should be on the budget right now its now been 53 days since the start of the fiscal year
6902279 wireless carriers have no technical requirements for 1 10 dialing although wireless carriers will complete 1 10 digit calls as well
6902280 a lot of times we are scared to report gang crime because of fear of retaliation
6902281 we think its good police are being more vigilant especially about gang crime
6902282 its a protection for the family especially for the kids
6902283 we are scared that shots will strike the windows and hurt the children
6902284 i think some people are scared to report crime but i think they should report it so police can capture criminals and keep families safe
6902285 those we didnt catch will be looking over their shoulders and will probably not commit crimes
6902286 i dont discriminate i feel sorry for those girls me and my staff always treat our employees with honor and respect i would like to extend this opportunity for and the girls that were fired to come into my venues for an interview
6902287 es mejor tener una industria de defensa aunque salga muy c
6902288 although we were unable to capture the dogs animal services will be working with zoo officials to place traps in the area to capture the dogs additionally we are actively patrolling the area
6902289 because of the quick response of our security animal control and eppd no other animals were harmed
6902290 our zoo keepers are crushed at the loss of these two longstanding animals at the zoo
6902291 hope was a female pronghorn antelope who arrived here in 1990 and dakota a sandhill crane known for following keepers around when they were feeding him or cleaning the exhibit he had been here since 1994
6902292 there are a lot of dogs that run lose throughout neighborhoods and its a problem at many zoos
6902293 once they decide to get in they are very effective and lethal and are good diggers
6902294 law enforcement officers deal with feral dogs way too often and dogs usually strike at night when there are few people around
6902295 they appear similar to two of the three animals reported by zoo security as killing the antelope and crane wednesday evening
6902296 we are grateful for the quick response and coordination with animal services
6902297 we are also appreciative of the outpouring of support and concern by the community
6902298 were very grateful to animal services for allowing us to borrow their traps while we attempt to find the third suspected dog
6902299 the same feminist movement that encouraged women to use their critical faculties also gave them the green light to be hostile and demeaning towards men
6902300 weve had a few decades of this shtick and have produced a new generation of children tattooed pierced angry depressed obese anorexic drugged self mutilating whoring pimping failing
6902301 boys had absorbed the message that life isnt fair and that girls are to blame nobody likes a teachers pet and girls were the cultures pets
6902302 twenty five million american children are more likely to see a father on television than in the home
6902303 a 2007 university of washington study revealed that women reported instigating domestic violence twice as often as men in the previous year
6902304 women can kill their husbands with relative impunity as long as they can convince a jury that they were in an abusive marriage
6902305 the states power in criminalizing fathers and alienating their children is an astounding development in a free democratic society
6902306 for the past thirty years or so males have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all lifes ills
6902307 youre being arrested for exercising rights you thought you had but i guess you didnt have em didja
6902308 in the age of obama is street protest still relevant
6902309 a scripted and sanitized spectacle for a homogenous group of wealthy elites inside the convention hall versus a thriving organic movement of the masses outside
6902310 its to say to the whole country we are here
6902311 we plan to show that this is a crisis this is something that needs to be looked at with a little more urgency we dont have enough housing we dont have enough healthcare and its killing the people
6902312 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
6902313 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
6902314 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest
6902315 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
6902316 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
6902317 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
6902318 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
6902319 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
6902320 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
6902321 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
6902322 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
6902323 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
6902324 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
6902325 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
6902326 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
6902327 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
6902328 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
6902329 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
6902330 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
6902331 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
6902332 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
6902333 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
6902334 recreate 68 at the 2008 dnc has become a point of contention all its own even among activists born decades after 1968 and bred amid a new world order
6902335 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
6902336 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
6902337 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
6902338 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
6902339 we really need to find a way to engage the people who are excited and really do think that obamas gonna change something
6902340 we have to do a lot of popular education to say that it isnt politicians who make real change its the movements that politicians have to follow
6902341 its always fun to come up with unique pairings cast reunions and surprising personalities as presenters on the emmy show and this year weve got a number of those
6902342 and the good news is weve got plenty more to come
6902343 i like this orientation because it gets me more familiar with the school so im not lost and getting late
6902344 tell them you have been abused and you will receive all you need
6902345 my husband could black my eye so me and the kid could go to a battered womans shelter
6902346 you dont put up any more barriers for victims wanting to enter the shelter
6902347 in all the time that i volunteered there i saw one woman who showed signs of physical abuse
6902348 were just gaming the system all they had to do was make up some tale about some man abusing them no proof needed and they could stay up to two months at the shelter
6902349 free hostel for women with emotional problems if they are willing to hate their husbands enough and are willing to take out protective orders against their husbands
6902350 after hours some of these women would sneak men into their rooms the same men who had supposedly abused them
6902351 i on numerous occasions reported illegal drug use that i had witnessed take place on shelter property and often my complaints were ignored
6902352 in 2006 5 886 individuals were turned away from shelters in colorado due to a lack of capacity
6902353 i do not want to live on this twisted sick system i dont want them in my life i dont want to play the game and lie i only need help
6902354 its these drug companies i think its disgusting theyre making so much
6902355 its an uncertain business and its a very lengthy business so its fair for us to recoup what we put in
6902356 the research engines of pharmaceutical companies are the most robust in the united states
6902357 its highly unlikely the drug companies are going to become benevolent charitable organizations and give away their drugs
6902358 if youre one of the few lucky people that can afford it its a great system to be in if youre one of the people who fall through the cracks its just a desolate situation to be in
6902359 you just get off at the last exit catch the bus over
6902360 its so sad to see elderly people with their canes going there to get their meds
6902361 sometimes im sitting there thinking are they going to look in their computer system and see that ive transferred already
6902362 its a little bit stressful to think that way and somewhat embarrassing
6902363 then he would end up getting sick when he doesnt have it he ends up picking up any virus or cold that walks by
6902364 theyre still paying their premium and saying now i have to pay 100 percent of my prescription
6902365 im always looking at products to see what the cholesterol and fat levels are im giving up some foods that i really do enjoy i dont want to fork out the money if i dont have to
6902366 weve put additional resources into outside consultants to come in and provide assessment to the hospital to ensure prompt corrective action was identified and completed weve invested in our internal infrastructure as well as brought in additional outside resources
6902367 pacific health continues to maintain that our hospitals have an excellent track record for providing quality care
6902368 we have a long running history of providing high quality services to the patients that receive services in our hospitals
6902369 we have been cooperating with the city attorneys office since late 2006 and we will continue to cooperate fully
6902370 we have been advised not to comment on the status of their civil suit or any related investigations on the basis that theyre confidential
6902371 well continue to focus on our existing hospitals we will also continue to seek out acquisitions that have strategic importance to the existing facilities that we own and operate
6902372 we have not had a string of adverse patient outcomes which have been directly correlated to the deficiencies noted at anaheim general
6902373 for example the nature of the deficiencies at anaheim general that they have been fined for are basically the temperature was off on drug storage and the thermometers were off in the patient rooms vs the types of deficiencies with some of the other fines theyre certainly much worse outcomes
6902374 wed like to wrap up the title but you can see the competition is going to make it tough
6902375 helio is very strong and so is tk tony kanaan and my teammate dan wheldon as well
6902376 there are still a lot of points in the game
6902377 we know what we need to do i think they have more to lose than us were going to continue trying like we have been doing the last two races pair of runner up finishes to dixon were going to be fighting even if theres just one point and even if it looks impossible were going to have the faith we can get it
6902378 its been tough when you switch on the tv and you see the cars going around
6902379 i knew it was going to be tough before and i made those sacrifices when i put my name on the contract to know there was going to be a good future with this team and certainly moving forward
6902380 well be doing the last three and hopefully well get a full program sorted out for next year
6902381 i saw my dad go through so much turmoil during the split
6902382 certainly getting back together is good for sponsors great for the sport and most of all the fans with so many cars every week has great dynamics
6902383 theres such a breadth of talent now every race 15 to 18 drivers could win before this season there were maybe 18 total cars in qualifying the depth of the field is the biggest difference
6902384 would be completely incompatible with life even incompatible with breathing
6902385 while marcela was alive her pediatrician affirmed that the child is very active recognizes her mother and cries when she isnt in her arms
6902386 marcela is a clear example that a child even with such a deformity is a human being and as such deserves care and respect
6902387 even though anencephaly is listed as a lethal congenital illness with a short lifespan the fetuses that are afflicted with this disease must have their rights respected
6902388 life must be protected as a gift and an obligation even when its course is presumed to be brief there is an enormous ethical moral and spiritual difference between natural death and a death that is provoked the commandment applies here thou shalt not kill ex 20 13
6902389 that the department of health and human services funds do not support coercive or discriminatory policies or practices
6902390 simply because they adhere to life affirming patient protecting standards of medical ethics such as the hippocratic oath if current trends of coercion are allowed to continue patients will not be able to find physicians who share their life affirming values
6902391 the recent all out campaign by those who oppose conscience rights to muzzle these hhs regulations actually has served to highlight the need for the regulations
6902392 their comments have demonstrated the poisonous hostile and intolerant environment they have created for healthcare professionals who practice medicine according to life honoring standards of ethics
6902393 we must defeat this new rule in order to ensure access to accurate comprehensive health care including birth control and abortion services for every person who wants and needs it
6902394 receive a massive influx of our tax dollars to expand their deceptive operations and to attract hundreds of thousands of women who think theyll be getting medical care but instead will receive a large dose of anti choice ideology
6902395 clearly abortion advocates do not believe in the right to choose if the choice is not to participate in abortion or provide drugs that can take the life of a human being
6902396 hodari joins an ever increasing list of abortionists who are facing criminal charges across the nation this trend demonstrates that while abortionists believe and act as if they are above the law states are beginning to see how dangerous these clinics are and are beginning to crack down on them with the help of pro life whistleblowers
6902397 abortionists tend to be among the most troubled and dangerous people who prey on the vulnerabilities of women prosecuting them is a noble public service
6902398 a happy ending that a catholic university was willing to stand up for catholic rights
6902399 unfortunate but hopefully in the future people will do their homework a little better she was very public about her positions
6902400 any appeal to the principle of academic freedom in order to justify positions that contradict the faith and the teaching of the church would obstruct or even betray the universitys identity and mission
6902401 on behalf of our 20 000 plus member base dedicated to the renewal of catholic higher education the cardinal newman society publicly supports the resolve of the university of san diego administration to not re extend the offer to ruether
6902402 when we show our body without prudence without modesty we are prostituting ourselves
6902403 we have observed these abuses the festival will be used to correct these abuses observed in the way our female members dress some songs that our choirs sing and in the celebration mass some bishops have frowned at these things and have decided that we should find a way of addressing the issues
6902404 let not the gospel on being introduced into any new land destroy or extinguish whatever its people possess that is naturally good just or beautiful for the church when she calls a person to higher culture and better way of life under the inspiration of the christian religion does not act like one who recklessly cuts down and uproots a thriving forest
6902405 this is another opportunity for us as joint stakeholders in nation building to collaborate and ensure the success of the festival in question
6902406 it will not only bring out cultural features and arts that can be of liturgical benefit to the catholic church but also showcase the moral values of our culture and people to the world
6902407 planned parenthood is definitely involved in more than abortion its also deeply invested in sexualizing the youngest of our children so that theyll be lifelong dependents on planned parenthoods lucrative contraceptive and sexually transmitted disease services as well
6902408 this is part of an orchestrated effort to get the community to accept an organization that is inherently disgusting and despicable
6902409 planned parenthoods master advertisers can dress it up all they want but the truth will still prevail planned parenthood wants to get your kids hooked on sex and then rake in the abortion and contraceptive profits
6902410 the a word campaign and the take care down there web site are part of a larger national trend planned parenthood wants your kids and is willing to invest big in marketing promiscuity pornography and sex products to get them
6902411 this is the food that got them there thats what makes us the best in the world good jamaican hard food we dont need no drugs
6902412 they were too quick she didnt pass it because she was too quick but no worry we still love them theyre still jamaicas number one they make us proud true jamaica spirit
6902413 im feeling very proud of jamaicas athletes theyre number one jamaica to the world jamaica to the world
6902414 i feel like im drowning in the ocean because jamaica is a champion
6902415 rebecca adlington revealed her real score a pair of black christian louboutin pumps from her mum
6902416 with just four drivers in contention to win the indycar series championship the pressure is on and in order to help fans and viewers at home easily identify those four contenders firestone racing will debut a new tire look for the eligible cars while these tires will be the exact same specification used by all indycar series drivers they will make the top four really stand out in the crowd based on our experience with this particular spec earlier this year in mid ohio we are confident that our softer road course tire compound construction will help drivers navigate the twisting infineon track and all of its elevation changes so as the championship battle reaches its concluding stages drivers will have the confidence in their tires needed to focus on the task at hand
6902417 we expected to be on the pole but it was a tough session it was difficult to time traffic so i got traffic on both of my new tire runs so it was quite difficult but at least the guy im battling in the championship is right behind me so thats a good thing well see i think we have a consistent car for tomorrow so we need to make sure we make the right adjustments for the race tomorrow
6902418 qualifying for us was ok the gearbox let us down in the last two laps i think the shift cable broke maybe i pushed too hard on the cable but were pushing because its qualifying im hoping to put up a solid finish tomorrow with the lucas oil lifelock car and gain the maximum amount of points possible
6902419 being sportsmen in our country weve met a couple of times whenever they do awards back home im a big fan of all sports and for sure i support sportsmen from my country
6902420 there is a lot of competition in any sport especially when you come overseas people dont really recognize you you have to learn the language and you have to learn a lot of the different things that we dont deal with in our country you have to work really hard to stay on it and be humble about it this is my 20th season in the big leagues so im really proud that i still have the chance to go out there and compete at a very high level
6902421 its the first time to watch the indycars in person
6902422 thats what wed like to do but you can see the competition is going to make it tough helio is very strong and so is tk tony kanaan and my teammate dan wheldon as well weve had a pretty good streak recently if we can keep it up and gain points on helio castroneves then thats the way wed like to do it
6902423 weve had a bit of rough year on road courses compared to the past especially at st pete and watkins but at edmonton we showed that the team is very strong we have the speed but it seems we struggle a bit more in qualifying we just cant seem to get the speed the others have for one or two laps the race were fairly confident
6902424 its a slight change i think it will help it opens up a passing opportunity but its tough because you have cars that are fairly equal so its hard to pass its very easy to overshoot so if youre close enough to someone in the race you could pressure them into a mistake it will be a lot easier to make a pass than what it was
6902425 were trying to put it all behind us every time we go back to the truck its hard to forget because were missing a lot of our tools that we would be able to use here the good news is that team penske is always prepared we had a truck that came from and brought a bunch of stuff that well be able to use as replacements this weekend but things like the seat that i really liked it unfortunately burned but you cant complain the car is actually in great shape and ready to go they are trying to make it look like nothing happened and to be honest if you didnt know about the fire it would probably still be like that this is the team that can rebound they know how to do it it happened once and hopefully this will be the last time
6902426 i told them that my setup was on fire all joking aside the good news is that nobody was hurt and things can be replaced whats amazing is the attitude of the team theyve been working a lot and theyre going to be working a lot up until the race theyre not complaining nobody is having any trouble so for me this just shows how incredible those guys are and to have the opportunity to work with people like that is just incredible
6902427 absolutely otherwise i wouldnt be here there are still a lot of points in the game we know what we need to do i think they have more to lose than us were going to continue trying like we have been doing the last two races were going to be fighting even if theres just one point and even if it looks impossible were going to have the faith we can get it
6902428 the good news is that i am very comfortable with the road courses the bad news is that he is also very comfortable with the road courses its going to be neck in neck in his situation he doesnt have to do much i think just following can be the best thing that he can do because if he makes a mistake it would cost more than he would gain im not counting on him making a mistake and im not wishing him a mistake what i can do is just focus on the work ahead of us and thats what were going to do
6902429 realistically i dont think i can win the championship i just want to focus on having a real strong finish to the season and do well in these last few races and australia obviously i dont think scott dixon really needs too much help at this point but ill certainly be the teammate that he needs me to be in any given situation
6902430 i guess weve been in the top five an awful lot and weve won a couple of races is it the season i would have liked no is it the season i expected no theres just been some situations that just havent really gone our way from a car standpoint you look at how fast we were at kentucky and we werent quick enough i was running flat out behind scott and i just couldnt keep up we havent always had the fastest cars but thats just sometimes how the seasons go but if we can end strongly that will certainly change the way people see the season out
6902431 its for the fans so its good they can appreciate whos on a championship run and who is not it was a great idea and i enjoy being a part of it for sure
6902432 i think that being fourth the pressure is a lot higher because im trying to catch the other guys hopefully i can do well and keep the white ring tires for the next few races
6902433 if there is a team that knows how to rebound its team penske again they did a fantastic job they tried to make sure i dont feel a difference and to be honest i dont the car is basically the same i keep joking that the seat that i loved burned up but the one i have here is very similar its a good start for whats been a tough two days to finish the day in p1 is a great deal but tomorrow is a bigger deal and so is the race so were going to keep working hard
6902434 not really we tested here last week for the first time since about january i didnt test but ryan briscoe tested actually it wasnt even ryan it was romain dumas it just proves that a little bit of laps around this place helps a lot we may not have gone fast but it helps eliminate some things you may have tried today it was just one lap but i tell you everyone will come back tomorrow and try to go fast again
6902435 it was a good day for the team 7 eleven guys we worked on the qualifying setup in the morning and we concentrated on the race in the afternoon session im pretty pleased with how today went were going to try and maximize our situation and finish as high as we can in the championship im just working on winning some more races for the team after you win the championship finishing second third fourth or fifth i dont think will make a big difference obviously we are working toward a real possibility that there will be a big fight between me and dan wheldon for the third position in the championship if you look at helio castroneves and scott dixon they are so consistent right now that i think its going to be really difficult to catch them so im focused on winning races
6902436 it helped kv racing technology to come here to test last week it brought us closer to the established teams which is where we want to be but we still need to keep working its getting very close to the end of the season and everyone is very eager to win so it is good that we are in the ballpark for the pole we still have all day tomorrow and then the race on sunday before it is decided until then we will keep on learning and trying new things with the car overall i am happy with the progress we are making
6902437 it was very difficult to get a good lap in with so many cars on track but the aussie vineyards team australia car was quick we still need to work some things out to make the car a little bit better our aim for tomorrow is to not only make the firestone fast six but to be right up at the front
6902438 today we mainly worked on our qualifying setup qualifying on road courses this year has been really competitive so we want to be sure that we know what we have in the car for tomorrow were happy with the car even though we werent at the top of the speed charts we put on a new set of tires right before the end of the session but we were unable to post a time well just continue working in the morning and hope for the best come qualifying in the afternoon i have to say that im super proud of our crew with the way that they have handled the adversity in the wake of the transporter fire they have been working really hard since they landed yesterday to make sure that i have what i need in the car and i have no complaints
6902439 we had a good day today in the delphi national guard car we knew we would have a good package after the test last week and luckily that translated into today there was an issue this morning with our braking but the panther guys were able to fix that during the break and you could see how quick we were this afternoon were happy with fifth position overall in practice today and look forward to making a run at the firestone fast six tomorrow
6902440 i am happy with the way the motorola car did today in both practice sessions we found some direction on some things that we needed and i feel really good about the direction that the car is going hopefully we will continue to build from the practices into qualifying tomorrow i am hopeful that the motorola car will be in the firestone fast six at the end of the day
6902441 the blockbuster star wars the clone wars car was not too bad today i still think we have some room to improve we had our best most consistent balance at the end of the afternoon session once we are able to put new tires on that car we should be able to be pretty good
6902442 we had a good first day i think the car was fast right off the bat so the boys certainly did their homework i like the track here a lot ive never raced here but always wanted to and it is everything i expected it is a beautiful track and i think i learned it rather quickly so we were able to get right to work and develop the car considering we didnt test here like many of the other teams i think we are doing quite well and we also have some good ideas for tomorrow so i am looking forward to another good day

6902519 right wing christians are very risky allies for american jews
6902520 because they the christians are really anti semitic they do not like jews
6902521 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6902522 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6902523 societys first woman president last year said that many american jews have an existential fear that muslims are anti israel
6902524 fathers work hard to support and encourage their kids but the misandrist policies of clark have delivered much parental alienation such aberrant family policy must be voted out at the next election by voting wise and voting republican
6902525 we are now seeing the social consequences of this double whammy delivered by helen and the funny girls
6902526 despite the hits that fathers have taken from the clark government we can still have some fun with a concert and a lolly scramble see you at the fathers piknik on saturday the 6th of september

6902537 es sobre el modelo de desarrollo que estamos los colombianos construyendo
6902538 violencia y tierra han sido una dupla perturbadora desde los inicios de la nacionalidad y hoy vuelven a estar en el centro del conflicto entre cuatro y seis millones de hect reas arrebatadas por la fuerza a tres millones de desplazados dan fe de la dram tica situaci n que se vive actualmente el pa s realidad que constituye una crisis humanitaria de diversas proporciones
6902539 las autoridades est n obligadas por los medios que estimen conducentes a corregir las visibles desigualdades sociales a facilitar la inclusi n y participaci n de sectores d biles marginados y vulnerables de la poblaci n en la vida econ mica y social de la naci n y a estimular un mejoramiento progresivo de las condiciones materiales de existencia de los sectores m s deprimidos de la sociedad
6902540 que impiden un real acceso a la tierra en este caso a subsidios
6902541 si la p rdida de la tierra por la violencia ha sido la causa m s importante del desplazamiento el acceso a la misma debe ser parte sustantiva de la soluci n
6902542 que no se puede limitar a la expansi n de las llamadas islas de modernidad como las flores y la palma de aceite entre otras opciones que hoy se mezclan con las precarias agricultura y ganader a campesinas

6902547 the best vacation i ever had was a boat trip on the congo river
6902548 an american once told me that was three years ago in mozambique in a five star beach resort i was on the un payroll i had escaped the peacekeeping mission on rnr while he was on a reconnaissance trip for his multi millionaire clients
6902549 our six planned boat trips on the congo river are fully booked for 2007

6902557 but you said you are belgian it is your belgians who have brought this rule here
6902558 no congolese has no responsibility into whats going on in congo
6902559 because we the congolese we want peace we are tired of this foreign sponsored war and instability
6902560 if we cut ourselves off we would have only the mountains and the goats we would die from hunger
6902561 now on a lighter note i will sign this decree suspending the russian communist party
6902562 you cant say that the whole communist party supported the conspirators if we do things like this it will be a witch hunt
6902563 in human affairs of danger and delicacy successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry so often men trip by being in a rush if one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act he should first inspect the end to be achieved and then once he had accepted the end as desirable he should forget it completely and concentrate solely on the means by this method he would not be moved to false action by anxiety or hurry or fear very few people learn this
6902564 we hope your presence as guests here will not be for too long
6902565 your presence here and in other places is meant to prevent the scourge of war
6902566 i think the manipulation of children in that sort of way is contemptible
6902567 michael came here last night and had tea with valerie
6902568 they then left at about 7 30pm in a grey morris car which i understood belonged to michaels mother they took with them maps and other things to organise a car rally being held at their office this weekend
6902569 valerie has worked at the laboratory since she left school five years ago and she has known michael for a long time
6902570 americans 1 002 interviews were completed were asked a range of questions regarding education including questions about national education standards measuring student achievement and how u s schools compare with schools in other countries
6902571 the 2008 kappan poll of older white wealthy college educated women east of the rockies
6902572 the most important news to come out of pdf is not the responses to any of the questions but the sample composition 65 women 84 white 50 aged 50 and older 44 college graduates and 71 with some college experience 43 with incomes 50k and above and 19 from the census west region of the country i skimmed through the questions with some interest and then my jaw dropped on the last page
6902573 for clarification the gallup organization ensures that the poll sample is identified through a truly random process this means its possible to oversample one portion of the population in order to correct for this the responses are matched and balanced against the u s census population parameters that balancing process ensures that the sample reflects the u s population of course in all polling there remains a sampling error in our case 3 standard for a national sample
6902574 and here i thought that was the standard research sample except for the woman part

6902580 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6902581 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6902582 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6902583 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6902584 we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6902585 theyre looking for help obviously and the scale of help is such that i dont think it can come from the private sector
6902586 what well see is failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did
6902587 in retrospect i was wrong to partially sell the holdings
6902588 the only way to get somebody who agrees with you 100 percent is to run yourself and i have no interest in that
6902589 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6902590 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6902591 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6902592 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6902593 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6902594 dont you really want to be around for one more campaign
6902595 people who live in glass houses ought not to throw stones dont ya think
6902596 since when did democrats care about how many houses people own
6902597 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
6902598 does anybody talk about how he opened up his house to an orphan who needed a home has obama opened his house to anyone
6902599 shows how desperate he is and how desperate the campaign is
6902600 anyone who has heard his own songs played by cy immediately has a greater respect for his own work though utterly respectful of the composers and songwriters whose music he plays he is also highly complex both rhythmically and harmonically in his interpretations of their music all the while maintaining a constant balance of delicacy and sensitiveness
6902601 obamas about to pick his running mate and then theres the convention so this story will die out after a day or two dont worry about it
6902602 for breaking his promise to his constituents made during his last campaign that he would campaign for the democratic nominee for president
6902603 connecticut sen joe lieberman the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6902604 know what else john mccain doesnt know if any of his houses share a border with pakistan
6902605 hey john mccain cant remember how many houses he has its not his fault though he had the number written down but he left it in his other plane
6902606 tony rezko im sorry for a moment there i thought i heard you asking a question about charles keating you remember the dont you when john mccain was accused of corruption on behalf of his buddy charles keating and those real estate deals cindy mccain had with keating oh excuse me that should really be convicted felon charles keating shouldnt it amazing how many times weve heard the media talk about tony rezko without charles keatings name coming up once isnt it
6902607 why wont cindy mccain allow america to see her tax returns what is she hiding why does she file separately from her husband dont they trust each other with their money barack and michelle file jointly as a married couple and theyve released their tax returns for all to see cindy mccain must be hiding something maybe just how filthy rich she is or maybe something else who knows
6902608 i think middle class americans are getting pretty tired of country club republicans trying to pass themselves off as regular folks and country club mccain is just one example of that if you ask hard working american voters i think theyd tell the republicans to take that baloney back to their country clubs because theyll be voting for the guy who hasnt had everything handed to him on a silver platter in life
6902609 of course john mccain is for tax cuts for millionaires but thats about it most of his tax cuts which are really the george w bush tax cuts go to millionaires like himself barack obama is for a 1 000 tax cut for middle class taxpayers and mccains plan only gives them a tiny fraction of this amount republicans are always for cutting taxes on millionaires but republican tax cuts never seem to make it down to the middle class obamas plan guarantees middle class tax cuts and will also end the special treatment for millionaires bush wrote into the tax code
6902610 at the same time john mccain was telling the american people quote 51 million homeowners are doing whats necessary working at second jobs skipping a vacation and managing their budgets to make their payments on time unquote out on the campaign trail cindy mccain was buying a second condo at the beach seems the one the mccains had wasnt big enough for the whole family i wish i were making this up but im not cindy said in an interview where she talks about buying a second multi million dollar condo in the same place quote when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one unquote the elitism in that statement is just flat out stunning in the first place how many wives would say i bought some real estate every single married person i know would say we bought instead secondly life must really be so tough out on the campaign trail for the mccains that they just cant survive with only one multi million dollar condo but instead have to have a separate one for the kids must be nice to be so out of touch with the reality most americans are facing
6902611 earlier in this campaign cindy mccain told the story of how mother teresa herself talked cindy into adopting a bangladeshi orphan now the fact comes out that mother teresa was actually in mexico at the time whoops maybe you should ask her about that the next time you interview her what do you think check with the christian science monitor because the mccain campaign website has already scrubbed the story from their pages
6902612 this extraordinary picture shows that prison security is a shambles and is another major embarrassment for the government it begs belief that a convicted knife murderer would be allowed access to a potentially lethal kitchen knife
6902613 everyone coming into the prison prisoners visitor and staff will have to pass through the new measures and all handbags briefcases clothing etc will be subject to screening
6902614 its crazy here and its probably a million times more so at home
6902615 i wish i was at home watching this but unfortunately i had to fight
6902616 there is an old saying in boxing the matador will always beat the bull kenny is a matador
6902617 his trial in vietnam was a charade a travesty of justice
6902618 this morning was an opportunity for him to come before english justice for the first time to make those points
6902619 to prepare a plan for his protection and well being
6902620 being realistic about it which country is going to accept him
6902621 i appreciate very much the support of readers of the irish examiner but it is very unlikely to happen
6902622 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6902623 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by electric fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6902624 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6902625 that is potentially a world changing event it is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6902626 hell say how did i do dad and ill say ah not too bad
6902627 you know kenny doesnt know whats going on here im like a full time receptionist taking calls all day and its mad but kenny just thinks its funny hes not like a big star when hes out socially he never even talks about boxing
6902628 the dollar sent oil prices higher yesterday and lower today
6902629 the reopening of the btc pipeline through turkey is being greeted with relief because there will be additional barrels of really good quality crude available
6902630 the volume of oil will be ramped up over the weekend and if everything is set loadings will begin on monday
6902631 the economy continues to be on the bearish side of the ledger while geopolitical concerns are on the bullish side
6902632 in between there is the dollar which can send prices either way i think russia and the dollar will determine what prices do next week
6902633 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6902634 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6902635 against the backdrop of a deteriorating labour market and a weakening general economy in addition to the numerous drains on household incomes we are likely to observe weakness in retail sales and consumer spending in general for some time at this stage the risks to our 1 5 consumer spending forecast for 2008 are skewed firmly to the downside
6902636 retail sales make up approximately 50 of total consumer spending and therefore only tell part of the picture in the first quarter of 2008 total consumer spending rose by 3 5 as buoyant spending on services offset the weakness in retail sales from yesterdays figures we know that retail sales in the second quarter were considerably weaker than the first given that it is hard to conceive any reason why services spending will remain robust in the second quarter and thereafter it is almost certain we will observe a considerably weaker level of consumer spending with second quarter data in september
6902637 the bottom line is that the irish economic picture continues to deteriorate and with consumers clearly retrenching we strongly believe that the government should be looking at providing fiscal stimulus for example tax cuts in the december budget to alleviate the pain on the hard pressed personal sector
6902638 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5m and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6902639 the joy of sex was the first book i read which was sexually aspirational someone in my boyfriends flat had a copy before he and i had done it
6902640 it was very useful we did giggle but we also thought wow all the bondage and s amp m stuff was very revolutionary in fact one of my sadnesses in updating the book is that whatever i did i could never be as revolutionary
6902641 parents who expected me to go to my wedding bed a virgin
6902642 i dont think there has ever been more need for education because were living in a society which is far more sexualised than when alex comfort was writing
6902643 at the same time i know people in their thirties who still dont know about the importance of the clitoris
6902644 i think what a lot of the other material out there misses is how powerful sex is people die for it literally one of the ways weve gone wrong in the past is that we havent recognised this emotional power sex isnt a game its not pink and black and fluffy so i think there still is a need for a book that takes sex seriously
6902645 i enjoy sex enormously i wouldnt be writing about it so enthusiastically if i didnt
6902646 my problem is i dont know when to keep my mouth shut recently i was in the pub and somebody said what is this thing about female ejaculation i dont believe a word of it i said no honestly it does exist i know because i ejaculate just as the whole pub went quiet luckily a group of guys was passing and one said very pleasantly good for you girl good for you
6902647 the name given to any sexual literature someone is trying to suppress
6902648 to cure the notion that common sex needs are odd or weird
6902649 alex comfort wrote the book on the back of the atmosphere i experienced in the late sixties and early seventies of seeing sex as something like a big treasure box you were opening and taking out wonderful things there was a real innocence and an innocence of the hurt that can be done
6902650 only 25 per cent of girls enjoy losing their virginity whereas the percentage is much higher for boys that is down to biology but nobody ever tells the kids that
6902651 kids want the emotional relationship stuff and the negotiating skills how to say no to someone who says if you loved me youd sleep with me
6902652 im glad im not ten years younger because there are an awful lot of pressures on young people to look fabulous to have a fabulous sex life
6902653 were living in a world where its important to achieve and whether we have a good sex life has become one of our measures of personal validity alex comfort took the emphasis off achievement that is one of the many things he got right
6902654 we can confirm the deaths of four british nationals in a road traffic accident on august 20
6902655 we are still seeking clarification about the accident from the south african authorities
6902656 its terrible kay was a beautiful elegant woman and they were a devoted couple

6902662 we opposed the war but now we will support our iraqi brothers and sisters as they rebuild their country
6902663 why cant i remember much from age 10 and before
6902664 yes i can see it your curly wig and red nose have floated over there just next to mine
6902665 keep smiling and edge towards the exit i think thats lembit opik in the audience
6902666 oh come on darling thats completely laughable this is how you do a crocodile and a swan
6902667 in the olympic village tomorrow night thousands of young men and women with the most fit ripped toned and muscled bodies in the world who are at the peak of their physical prowess and havent had sex for at least two weeks will mingle for the last time before they fly home
6902668 it is common to see eliminated athletes gorging on magnums
6902669 unhappily the vast majority of independent readers constitutes an infinitesimal minority of the population
6902670 a fairly obvious take on proceedings in parliament from our sketch writer
6902671 the musician was best known for donning dark sunglasses at live concerts
6902672 i reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
6902673 we lead aussies with 12th olympic gold now thats what we call a gday sport
6902674 i put my hand out and bob didnt put his out i took my hand away and he put his out we finally did shake
6902675 i would rather win bronze than silver i mean with bronze its like hey i wasnt expecting anything and at least i got something with silver you are the first loser
6902676 i cant do fish and im petrified of what might be underneath me

6902681 eine strategie nennt man die anwendung der sprachmittel des politischen journalismus wom glich nur bei juden die daf r auch noch preise erhalten und trotzdem nicht die aggressive klappe halten denn so wie israel im krieg gegen den libanon stets ein aggressor war weil es seine dorthin entf hrten soldaten zur ckhaben wollte so ist nat rlich der jude aggressiv der antisemiten widerspricht und schlimmer noch er nutzt den ihm nach f nfundvierzig g tig eingerichteten spielraum der meinungsfreiheit um seine staatssch digende demokratiefeindliche wirkung zu entfalten so und nicht anders steht es in bahners text broder schr nkt die meinungsfreiheit in deutschland ein indem er eine israelsolidarische meinung formuliert indem er den dummen und zynischen vergleich des nationalsozialismus mit dem staat israel den ein feuilletonchef der faz wohlwollend hinnimmt als antisemitische und antizionistische aussagen bezeichnet dadurch also beraubt broder die demokratie in deutschland das deutet auf ein ungutes verst ndnis von deutscher demokratie als einen raubtierk fig hin in dem die dompteure die staatsfeinde sind
6902682 vorgehaltenen u erungen handelt es sich nicht um s tze des typus die juden seien ja alle geldgierig
6902683 es geht ausschlie lich um kommentare zur israelischen politik und zu deren verteidigern
6902684 ghetto ist heute ein gebr uchlicher begriff das betrifft die vorst dte das betrifft amerikanische ghettos das ist ein normaler begriff
6902685 i seek to be a cup empty of myself to be filled with the oneness of the universe
6902686 now he was telling them a parable to show that at all times they ought to pray and not to lose heart
6902687 it was like living with jihad on a daily basis
6902688 im incredibly concerned that we did make an award to leeds community school over nine years ago and any allegation that funding weve given to any project has been misused and not used to change the lives of disadvantaged children and young people makes me concerned and very sad
6902689 we just want you guys to have a good time today
6902690 weve got to figure out and get to a point where i dont want to miss any more time it could be better tomorrow it could be better on sunday
6902691 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out
6902692 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6902693 he actually threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
6902694 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6902695 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6902696 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6902697 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6902698 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6902699 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6902700 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6902701 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6902702 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6902703 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6902704 oh i want to see king kong how cool would that be to tell my kids
6902705 uh okay well as long as it doesnt inconvenience you i was just kidding about the kong thing
6902706 uh okay you know we dont have to go out of our way

6902709 there he is theres the one youve been hearing about on the loudspeakers ive captured the monster
6902710 this is not how i expected this evening to turn out
6902711 so in so at the end of the table is a thai massage therapist
6902712 hey same person who made the first comment obviously has an agenda we ought to go get a thai massage
6902713 not me i hate massages they hurt besides arent they a little seedy nope not interested
6902714 hey theres a tattoo place we ought to get tattoos
6902715 causing the back end to flip up and land on the defendant as he fell off the moped
6902716 the defendant looked at him and then jumped over the railing
6902717 at which point the defendant started running back directly at officer nielsen
6902718 officer nielsen reports that he then punched the defendant in his lower torso and the defendant turned onto his stomach and put his hands behind his back
6902719 one of the great legacies is that he has started a public dialogue about the future of higher education in wisconsin
6902720 he has started it he has argued it and it is now our responsibility to make sure that everyone is engaged in it
6902721 if i could leave just one last serious message with the board i think its unfortunate that the state and regents treat tuition and state support as separate items
6902722 the really important public policy issue is i think answering a very simple question
6902723 how much is it worth to the individual that is the real question i dont know what the right balance is but that is the right question trying to figure out for the good of the state what fraction of the cost should the state pay
6902724 it doesnt overreach but it maintains what everybody seems to be supportive of and thats the growth agenda
6902725 it is so hard to believe this is happening again with our family
6902726 it is with a very heavy heart and almost unbelieving mind that i am reaching out again for help because of a missing person in my family
6902727 a little over a year ago my wife francine tate went missing and because of the time and energy of many people she was found and came home safely so now the goal is to bring these two children that are making poor decisions home safely
6902728 paint a picture of just how difficult the budget is going to be
6902729 im not going to lay off police officers or firefighters or eliminate crossing guards but everything else is on the table
6902730 we dont have much fluff anymore were cutting bone and muscle
6902731 were always concerned but the mayor has talked about prioritizing basic services thats what we do
6902732 it would be too significant a change in a one year period
6902733 but weve always had something to help mitigate the difficulty right now we dont have anything of the fashion we know of
6902734 on saturday victorias ma students had a chance to get some one on one advice on their novels when he presented a masterclass on narrative perspective beginning with the notion that a description always describes the describer among the variations powers offered on this theme was a scene from damien wilkins novel the miserables in which the main characters view of wellington from the deck of the interisland ferry reveals much about his state of mind
6902735 we want to tell the new skycity ceo nigel morrision not to be a rat and treat his staff decently
6902736 after all he is one of new zealands highest paid ceos yet proposes to pay his workers the minimum wage and a wage offer to the rest of his staff that is less than the inflation rate
6902737 therefore we very happy to be able to add to our existing programs especially at the elementary level where we can capture students interest at a young age
6902738 it is our hope that children will learn the instruments at an early age and go on to become monrovias youth orchestral musicians of tomorrow
6902739 i found something i had passion for which in turn made me passionate about school learning and going on to college its wonderful that monrovias school children will again have that same opportunity
6902740 we know how important the arts are in and of themselves and support the important role they play in boosting academic achievement
6902741 the good that has come out of that is that the shock one can only imagine the shock seems to have brought him to his senses
6902742 the government can reduce it further if it can be more transparent in its financial management eliminate leakages wastages and corruption

6902744 while michael is a member of the organization the organization is separate
6902745 ha sido un tiempo tedioso tengo ya casi cuatro meses sin jugar y ya estoy completamente recuperado de la lesi n f sicamente me falta un poco pero estoy seguro que ya puedo aportar para el equipo
6902746 fueron muchas cosas que hicieron que tardara tanto algunas de mi parte y otras de personas ajenas lo que intentamos fue que yo mejorara sin llegar a la operaci n para que no hubiera contraindicaciones despu s pero al final de cuentas no se pudo pero ahora me siento bastante recuperado y motivado por regresar a las canchas
6902747 yo creo que se ha jugado bien hemos tenido llegadas por ah no han sido las suficientes y no se han concretado pero la verdad yo me siento contento con el desempe o de mis compa eros ahora estoy luchando por conseguir un puesto y meterle esa explosividad que nos ha faltado
6902748 ese partido jugu poco como quince minutos pero me toc participar en el tercer gol en una triangulaci n entre mario ortiz y el cherokee p rez que termin el bola gonz lez ese fue uno de los partidos en los que mayor posesi n de pelota tuvimos mayor ofensiva demostramos y ojal se pudiera repetir esa historia porque estamos conscientes que nos hace falta una victoria
6902749 sino es la prensa son los directivos pero ac todos los d as hay presi n
6902750 para mi era un reto una revancha regresar a primera con el club con el que me ha ido mejor honestamente estoy contento de volver jugar en el cuauht moc y s sacamos un resultado nos vendr a bien an micamente
6902751 there are three rules for writing a novel unfortunately no one knows what they are
6902752 every speech should contain a line saying that you were born in the middle of america to a middle class family in the middle of the last century
6902753 i was born into a middle class family in the middle of the country in the middle of the last century
6902754 doesnt look like all those other presidents on dollar bills
6902755 when obama says hell only tax the rich hes saying he will only tax the engine room not the rest of the ship
6902756 doesnt look like all the other presidents on dollar bills
6902757 always try to be the one in the discussion that speaks the least
6902758 whether or not you decide to have an epidural you will have my support but since you asked this is how i feel
6902759 disinformation 22 average myths that undermine the war on terror
6902760 because they are all anti american leaders and the united states lose with that
6902761 so ke in qst momento qualunque cosa io possa dire o fare x te nn avrebbe senso xk nn servirebbe a ridarti qll ke hai perso e a farti star meglio ma io voglio cmq fare il mio
6902762 but my voice only echoed across the wide blank pavement with only the tungsten streetlamps bearing witness hanging their heads apathetically dim i almost turned back to get my dad and the car but for fear of losing even a second i just kept running beyond the staring skeletal eye sockets of a thousand darkened windows past the endlessly churning motorized waterfall at the entrance of our neighbourhood
6902763 every time he gets a hit he says its the hair
6902764 right now its just about around the shoulders and its not covering his name up and all that stuff so well continue to monitor and talk about it
6902765 que es que los jugadores nacidos en m xico mexicanos se pongan las pilas
6902766 demostr sven lo que tiene el equipo creo que sali diferente en actitud arrancamos atacando creo que este encuentro vali la pena para sven y creo que lo ganamos muy bien ganado supo combinar muy la gente joven con la de experiencia
6902767 jug un poco m s atr s de lo que debi haber jugado creo que l m s efectivo jugando m s adelante no conect bien con giovani dos santos y carlos vela hay que entender que ten an dos d as jugando juntos creo que sven los este conociendo y ser un proceso que ir hac a arriba con resultados la decisi n de traer a sven fue la mejor que pudimos haber tomado
6902768 jueguen como joyitas eso es l gico pero para el tiempo que tuvo lo hizo muy bien
6902769 the inspector showed up ms dakar showed up and just kind of pounced on her its not something that happens to our inspectors every day
6902770 has confidence in the justice system and trusts that this matter will be appropriately resolved in a court of law
6902771 ya se encargar daniel guzm n de como me ve
6902772 seguro porque pas bastante tiempo y uno lo que quiere es jugar as que bueno se lleg la hora as que esperemos jugar un rato
6902773 estoy bien ya se encargar daniel de como me ve l pero bien ah estamos con muchas ganas de hacer bien las cosas sabemos que no va a ser f cil el partido pero estamos con muchas ganas de hacer un buen partido
6902774 eso es bueno para que se le dificulte un poco a daniel a la hora de armar el equipo porque sabemos que tenemos grandes jugadores en el plantel as que se le va a complicar un poco y eso es bueno porque cuando vienen grandes compromisos como el que vamos a tener de ahora en adelante es importante tener un plantel bien numeroso
6902775 sulla cattedra di mos si sono seduti gli scribi e i farisei quanto vi dicono fatelo e osservatelo ma non fate secondo le loro opere perch dicono e non fanno
6902776 salah uddin shoaib choudhury has stood up for us at considerable peril now it is up to us to stand up for him
6902777 i would like people to know that a bipartisan resolution has been introduced in the house of representatives in support of mr choudhury it calls upon the government of bangladesh to drop all charges against him return his confiscated property and prosecute the individuals who attacked him please ask your readers to call their representatives in congress and ask them to support house resolution 1080 this is an urgent matter since congress will adjourn in another week or two at the most and it is important that the resolution pass with a huge majority before that the european parliament passed a resolution in support of mr choudhury last week its our turn
6902778 oh my god you guys are a walking snl skit
6902779 jammie pants fluffy bunny slippers and a half empty box of gallo looks like someones got the blues or in this case a lack thereof
6902780 this job is perfect for me because i dont have a very long attention span and i love to try new things like
6902781 i will trot down a street like abbot kinney in venice and leave a note and my business card at a storefront thats under construction
6902782 our hits tripled within three days after we were on dailycandy
6902783 my sales director got calls from buyers at other stores too
6902784 tyra banks came in because she saw us on dailycandy
6902785 we did like 12 000 in sales on our first day of business which is amazing
6902786 they definitely like to be first to write about something and get exclusive deals for their readers
6902787 look you dont want to get on the wrong side of the dailycandy girls
6902788 theyre perfectly nice but they like to get their way
6902789 but my biggest fear is that someone will read something i wrote about and say i already knew that
6902790 we want to keep the content fresh and our readers are already so savvy
6902791 the walls were still being painted when i sat in the store with the writer and told her what would be there
6902792 i was nervous but you dont want to say no to dailycandy
6902793 that said some of us are growing old and i am one of them
6902794 es un grupo humano muy valioso muy importante agradecido de la vida agradecido de indios han luchado antes han luchado ahora permanentes frente a sus responsabilidad por vencer y eso me tiene sumamente tranquilo lo otro lo t ctico ser paulatinamente y vendr con el d a a d a y quehacer permanente
6902795 me siento tranquilo desde el punto de vista emocional que haya tranquilidad que los muchachos dar n todo su esfuerzo como s que lo van a hacer de eso s estoy convencido comulgo con que los jugadores deben de saber que todos los partidos se deben de ganar ganar jugando bien si se puede si no ganar
6902796 ya tengo la idea de los jugadores que podamos utilizar lleg el pase de malague o y por la tarde podremos dilucidar qui nes podr an jugar
6902797 paco se integrar al trabajo de grupo hasta la pr xima semana y palacios estar en observaci n durante este par de d as para determinar si es conveniente que sea tomado en cuenta este domingo
6902798 siempre es importante cortar una racha negativa y sobre todo en casa pero hay que ver esta situaci n como lo que es s lo estad sticas obviamente este fin de semana ser oportunidad para revertir esos resultados y esperemos demostrarlo con un buen futbol y sobre todo que sigamos mejorando nuestro funcionamiento
6902799 its gonna be an awesome party with more than 7 things i like its gonna be totally awesome i hope its a great time
6902800 i found it particularly interesting that one out of three adults who were children of divorce say they accept things that they think are wrong in their own marriages because they dont want their kids to experience divorce
6902801 children of divorce are less likely to marry and more likely to divorce if they do
6902802 unfortunately many if not most children of divorce did not grow up learning how to communicate effectively resolve differences and work through the tough stuff in marriage
6902803 instead of accepting or ignoring the things that are wrong in their marriage they need to take active steps to fix what is wrong
6902804 io le faccio una domanda e se lei non sa rispondere mi d 5 euro e viceversa
6902805 okay facciamo cos se lei non sa la risposta mi d 5 euro ma se sono io a non saper rispondere gliene do 500
6902806 qual quella cosa che sale per una collina con tre gambe e scende con quattro
6902807 a fair point comrade i shall withdraw from apartment utterly and soon
6902808 this is promise of ceasefire are you calling me liar are you are you hey little frog dont squirm you want say that to my face you think i cant tear you apart with bare hands you want i should meet you in sushi restaurant huh huh
6902809 but your hand is still there et je suis about to pass out zut alors you will break les fingers
6902810 we are delighted from the point of view of being a state school coming top but league tables are only part of the picture
6902811 some of our most talented students come from very modest income backgrounds
6902812 by coming out of the tables they are leaving the public with very incomplete information
6902813 i completely understand that some heads feel that league tables have created an ugly competitiveness between schools i personally do not feel that this is important information and we should not keep it hidden
6902814 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
6902815 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
6902816 for the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force in afghanistan
6902817 now we have to struggle with the return of the classical nato challenge in georgia and were going to have to manage to do both
6902818 the era of russian weakness is over were now in a much more competitive relationship with russia and georgia has put european security back on the geopolitical map also for the us all that could mean a rejuvenation of nato
6902819 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
6902820 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
6902821 russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on natos part
6902822 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
6902823 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no
6902824 there is something about a coffin it is a big long box and inside the box is your broken husband and the lilies are crawling down your throat closing in as you go gagging you with their sticky pollen their fake spring their cheap dime store perfume
6902825 we have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances
6902826 the crisis is if you are losing customers and we have resolved that issue almost everywhere
6902827 who is going to want to buy city link when it is losing money and who is in the best place to fix it i am convinced we can do it in three to four years time we can think about our portfolio
6902828 the transfer period is yet to finish and things can still change
6902829 last year we sold martin skrtel to liverpool for 10 million and now probably arshavin will go to spurs
6902830 if his dad is right hes got two tremendous clubs to choose from
6902831 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6902832 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
6902833 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
6902834 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
6902835 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6902836 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6902837 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6902838 jamaica has done well at these games and were looking forward to going home sitting with these guys is wonderful these guys came out and we had fun
6902839 why criticise him hes doing his own thing hes not talking down to anybody hes not talking down to anybody the usa used to do things and nobody ever criticised them
6902840 i just want to make people happy they have paid money to come and so i want to give them a show i am just happy with my three gold medals
6902841 my feeling is that they will have to be raised because inflation is going to be a problem the bank cannot do anything about oil prices and it cannot do anything about global food prices
6902842 but its got to make sure we dont get into a wage price cycle bringing back really high inflation and making any slowdown worse than it otherwise would be
6902843 there must be a strong chance now that output is falling that the uk has already entered a technical recession
6902844 i can confirm our growth estimate for 1999 of 1 per cent to 1 5 per cent which is what i told the house in november followed by stronger growth
6902845 today i can report that in 1999 instead of the recession that many forecast the british economy grew by 2 per cent and britain has been growing steadily while meeting our inflation target
6902846 britain is today experiencing the longest period of sustained economic growth since records began in the year 1701
6902847 i can report that after 10 years of sustained growth britains growth will continue into its 59th quarter the forecast end of the cycle and beyond
6902848 while other countries have suffered recessions the british economy has now been growing continuously for over a decade the longest period of sustained growth in our history
6902849 child birth is an act of nature adoption is an act of god
6902850 everyone wants to play their part in making the olympics a success
6902851 the challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great success into 10 years of sporting triumph for our country
6902852 i will leave no stone unturned in my determination to make london 2012 a great success
6902853 thats a matter for the queen i think the country will want to see our athletes honoured and the country will want to celebrate their success and give them the permanent recognition they deserve
6902854 not content to win a silver medal in athens in 2004 she decided to change sports
6902855 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community
6902856 the 2008 beijing olympics have set a new standard for the olympic games which we in london in 2012 will seek to follow
6902857 he responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions
6902858 but there is no point getting ahead of ourselves because we start every series well we always win the first game and then mess the next four up the key to tonights victory is that we focus on nottingham on tuesday we turn up with the same energy the same buzz and the same confidence
6902859 our challenge now is to turn what has been two weeks of great sporting success into ten years of sporting pride for our country
6902860 weve got to prove that success is not just a one off weve got to extend our domination in sports
6902861 otherwise i couldnt have afforded to support myself in cycling
6902862 sustained investment plus world class athletes plus world class support equals medals
6902863 whats so hard about getting this right you dont need to be einstein to sit down and work it out america does it theyve got group training for their distance runners and everything is funded
6902864 with the backing we have and the talent we have we should be able to get a handful of gold medals in london
6902865 consular officials are in contact we continue to underline to the chinese government the need to respect its commitment to freedom of expression
6902866 the medicine they are ministering may be as likely to kill as cure it
6902867 trustees governors regulators in all cases a distrust of television having mass appeal lurks beneath the surface
6902868 a version of television that is understood by regulators consultants strategists and media commentators
6902869 it likes to imagine television as a form of social engineering
6902870 here we have the deathless language of the committee each word carefully weighed balanced and rinsed of all life and passion a definition of psb that exists only in the minds of those whose job it is to write such definitions
6902871 television needs regulators just as roads need traffic wardens but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
6902872 we are having to amend the legislation because you can get to a lot of places and back in three days we are playing catch up to close that loophole and it is a concern that it is there work is already in place to change the law so that the three day window is closed
6902873 at the moment we can place foreign travel orders on convicted sex offenders which stop them going abroad once on the sex offenders register but they have to be applied for through the magistrates courts and only last six months
6902874 we plan to extend that period and to introduce the immediate removal of an offenders passport these things are going to come in but they are not in place at the moment we hope they will be introduced as soon as possible
6902875 falls far far below what is acceptable for western european standards of justice
6902876 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
6902877 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
6902878 these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being im pleased to say thats in place
6902879 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice
6902880 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6902881 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6902882 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6902883 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6902884 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6902885 que diga lo que quiera no tengo que contestar comentarios de personas de otros equipos estoy consciente de que siempre van existir cr ticas pero lo nico que tengo que hacer es trabajar para ganarme un lugar en donde est ya sea en la selecci n o si no aqu en pumas dar lo mejor para que se logren los objetivos
6902886 los m s importante es que a pesar de que desde un inicio se toc mucho el tema de los llamados a nosotros los naturalizados desde la primera concentraci n los dem s jugadores me trataron muy bien lo cual me ayuda a que me trasmitieran much sima confianza pues me qued convencido que el grupo es muy s lido y unido que es lo principal
6902887 no creo que s lo a m me pas creo que todos los jugadores sienten una gran emoci n desde que salimos a calentar es indescriptible lo que se siente con el apoyo de la gente y sobre todo escuchar el himno nacional que provoca que se te ponga la piel chinita tras la vibra positiva que trasmite el p blico
6902888 esta semana fue muy importante para m porque afortunadamente el mi rcoles pude conseguir los primeros tres puntos dentro de la eliminatoria ahora espero cerrar la semana con un triunfo sobre pachuca y que el equipo mantenga un buen paso en casa

6902899 breast pain can be cyclic coming with menstrual periods or it can be more persistent
6902900 one of the best gifts they can give themselves and their babies is to breastfeed for as long as possible
6902901 then when your breasts shrink again you have this loose skin that makes it look saggier than it did before
6902902 theyre fibrous tissue that holds the breast up a bit and those can stretch over time and that leads to some of the sagging too
6902903 wearing a tight fitting bra on a regular basis probably doesnt make a big difference
6902904 but wearing a bra that prevents a lot of bouncing like with jogging probably does minimize stretching of those fibrous bands
6902905 many of these things that cause breast pain in young women are going to turn out to be benign but there are breast cancers that happen in young women
6902906 my advice is just because youre young and youre less likely to have a cancer doesnt mean that you shouldnt get it looked at
6902907 its easy enough and there are certainly women out there who find their breast cancers that way
6902908 i encourage all women to do a breast self exam and get comfortable with what their breasts feel like
6902909 thats when you have the least hormonal effect and youre going to have the most accurate exam
6902910 as we get older sort of in a progressive way but certainly after menopause the breast becomes more fat and has less glandular tissue
6902911 we lose the hormonal effect on our glandular tissue in our breasts and over time that tissue atrophies
6902912 thats a time when women notice their breasts are less firm certainly less tender if theyve had problems with tenderness and theyre less lumpy
6902913 as the fat content increases the sensitivity of the mammogram often increases

6902947 but thanks be to god that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching to which you were committed and having been freed from sin you became slaves of righteousness

6902951 since our opening we have received an extremely favorable response from the residents and businesses in san pedro who seem to appreciate a locally owned and operated bank we are well ahead of our projections for this banking center
6902952 we are pleased that we are able to continue reporting such favorable operating results in spite of an extremely difficult environment for financial institutions our asset quality remains strong with no delinquent loans or non performing assets lower interest rates have improved debt coverage for apartment loans which represent the main component of our loan portfolio
6902953 we continue to manage our cost of funds closely despite strong competition for liquidity in the deposit market although our total deposits have declined due to a decrease in certificates of deposit approximately 40 of the decrease has been replaced with lower cost transaction and money market accounts we are also starting to see the return of some cd customers who are opting for safety over higher rates

6902958 our clients were picked up by one of the largest casino operations in the world for a free flight and weekend of fun but instead they encountered an entirely avoidable commercial bus crash which we believe is due to the defendants transport of passengers in a poorly maintained and manufactured vehicle since august 1 2008 we have seen four commercial bus crashes nationwide two of which were fatal something has to change
6902959 bus and motor coach safety is mandated by federal regulation however the individual carrier has additional responsibilities to take all necessary measures to provide for the safe travel of its passengers in the instance of this crash harrahs failed on both counts the responsible parties violated several federally mandated regulations and made no effort to provide any additional safety precautions we believe these particular failures led to the injury and death of innocent individuals

6902969 if it were just an inadvertent handoff a freaky kind of a thing youd understand youd feel bad about it as a fan and youd moan and groan but i have a feeling its a symptom of a larger systemic problem i have dug into it enough to have some reservations with regard to some of the things that im hearing

6902974 although we still need to see many more women political candidates and office holders at all levels the promise of the statement that all men and women are created equal is ever closer to realization
6902975 we are ecstatic that our elected officials saw the merit in our arguments against this ill conceived and poorly written legislation unenforceable laws that cost californians money and infringe on personal rights are the last thing we need in california at the same time cdoc does believe that we all have to work together to reduce irresponsible pet ownership and we will continue to work with everyone to achieve that goal

6903083 it is asserted by the german government that their invasion of norway was a reprisal for the action of the allies in norwegian territorial waters this statement will of course deceive no one at no time did the allies contemplate any occupation of any scandinavian territory so long as it was not attacked by germany any allegations by germany to the contrary are pure invention and have no foundation in fact
6903084 pacts may be concluded with certain other countries if they further the interests of the soviet government and help render the opponent innocuous
6903085 the u s s r will not wait until the opportune moment occurs axis powers have further dissipated their forces and the u s s r will consequently strike a sudden blow against germany
6903086 according to information received from soviet sources armaments for the air force tank corps and artillery in accordance with experiences of the present war are in full progress and will in the main have been completed by august 1941 this probably also constitutes a time limit before which no appreciable changes in the soviets foreign policy can be expected

6903101 i really want to apologize to anyone who was looking for more t s entertainment or massage ads
6903102 there has really always been an unwritten rule in this city that you filled your paper with ads for bars and adult phone lines and asian massage parlors and maybe one or two feature stories that ran three pages
6903103 but to have your paper with 19 percent original content thats absurd theyve really thrown down the gauntlet
6903104 he absolutely loves the attention at first we just joked that he looked like coach reid in the hat but he completely embraced the roll
6903105 weve taught him to do the throat clear and we had an outside clothier create the huge black jacket and phony head set
6903106 at the end of the game he slides up on the land platform in his tank and gets behind a make shift podium with a microphone
6903107 aside from the nazis who no longer exist theres no greater villain for the american public than the russians
6903108 you hear a lot about the people getting in accidents because theyre talking on the phone but what about the people who are just talking to a passenger or changing the station or turning on the air conditioning

6903116 labor day is traditionally a slower travel holiday for families preparing for children to go back to school
6903117 in addition high gas and food prices the credit crunch and other economic factors are affecting many families as a result fewer people will travel for the labor day holiday this year

6903123 they have like a different wing for each grade and its really cool
6903124 this operation is the governments reaction to the militants actions which they took in violation of the peace agreement signed with the government
6903125 we will start operations in the entire country in the entire province because we consider this an action against all taliban we will soon take a decision on starting operations
6903126 peshawar is in a state of siege and if peshawar falls the rest of the districts in the nwfp would fall like ninepins
6903127 after a contingent was blown up by a rocket propelled grenade and charred bodies of policemen were retrieved and buried without allowing their dear ones to see their faces for the last time
6903128 not one of peshawars 30 police stations stays open after 8 p m police in rural peshawar have stopped night patrols after a patrol was blown up in a grenade attack on may 29
6903129 there is a great deal of interest the saudis americans european union scandinavians and chinese have all shown interest in the peace plan

6903131 doesnt look good for pakistan how can this frankenstein monster read taliban can be reigned in by pakistan
6903132 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
6903133 if it is not handled properly we could have a security issue
6903134 you dont want to give anybody a reason to turn back to al qaeda
6903135 some people from the government encouraged us to fight against al qaeda but it seems that now that al qaeda is finished they dont want us anymore
6903136 sacrificed and fought against al qaeda and now the government wants to catch them and arrest them
6903137 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
6903138 i dont think that area would have been calmed without those guys
6903139 like a drug addict who quits only to take drugs again
6903140 they committed crimes and attacked the iraqi army and the american army and there is no way to rehabilitate them
6903141 we dont want this to be a dead end kick them to the curb kind of thing
6903142 our men worked hard and deserve appreciation and not punishment from the government
6903143 america is the only one asking us not to fight the maliki government
6903144 part of them will fight the government if they are not recruited into the security forces
6903145 for part of the exercise the us rear admiral commanding csg 7 will be in command and for the rest it will be our western fleet commander

6903148 in order to ensure smooth traffic flow a nice environment and good social order we will invite these participants to hold their demonstrations in designated places
6903149 for chinese petitioners if their protest applications were approved it would lead to a chain reaction of others seeking to voice their problems as well
6903150 when you have guests coming over for dinner you clean up the house and tell the children not to argue
6903151 im glad to hear that over 70 protest issues have been solved through consultation dialogue
6903152 given this moment when the international spotlight is shining on china when so much of the international media are in beijing its unfathomable why the authorities are intensifying social control
6903153 the truth is theyre sending a clear and disturbing message one theyre not even trying to hide which is were not even interested in hearing dissenting voices
6903154 some have learnt many tricks of sly evasion instead of truth they use equivocation and eke it out with mental reservation which is to good men an abomination
6903155 ussr didnt capture poland alone should it let germans occupy the whole country
6903156 were those countries wiped out from the map did they loose their culture the only visible difference in the culture was that the kids had to learn russian in schools

6903167 hes so mentally strong theres a ball in the rough to him its just a ball to hit when hes over a putt he thinks he can make every putt
6903168 we believe that such a raid could not have taken place unless mr maliki had at least prior knowledge of it
6903169 he didnt inform the ministry of interior and the ministry of defense about this raid
6903170 all of these operations basra amara mosul have political dimensions that are unannounced
6903171 we believe it is to give prime minister maliki a foothold and standing in these provinces
6903172 you still remember what happened to sean it makes you remember

6903182 we continue to view wet seal management as doing the right things in these uncertain times
6903183 potential obama vp is pro war pro patriot act neo con
6903184 we believe the company is proving that with savvy marketing and compelling online offerings it is able to transition the business with increasing confidence
6903185 we see this as a bullish sign from a management team that usually sets highly conservative targets on initial fiscal year guidance
6903186 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes
6903187 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6903188 youve got a long way to go to be as good as your dad dick schaap
6903189 tornadoes analyzes the most destructive tornadoes ever caught on tape hear eyewitness accounts from those who survived the storms and watch the footage they risked their lives to capture

6903191 aarons is more than a sponsor of michael waltrip racing they are a partner
6903192 we have been together nearly a decade when our relationship began we were racing out of a shop behind my house their business has grown tremendously as has our team i am proud of our record together and look forward to continuing our partnership for many years to come
6903193 we are proud to extend our relationship with michael david and mwr in 2009
6903194 as aarons enters its 10th year of partnership with mwr we look forward to continuing our alliance which has been such a vital component of aarons brand awareness and growth over the years
6903195 david reutimann has shown tremendous advances in the sprint cup series and has performed with championship form in the nationwide series and we are delighted to support him again next season
6903196 having michael waltrip get back behind the wheel of the aarons dream machine is something our fans have been asking about for some time now and we are pleased to be able to accommodate
6903197 i could not be more pleased that aarons is back on board with us next year
6903198 i love what this company represents and certainly enjoy carrying their brand and the aarons lucky dog on my toyota camry i appreciate their faith in me and our race teams and i will work really hard to put the aarons dream machine in victory lane in both divisions they have been a huge supporter of me michael and michael waltrip racing and were looking forward to whats in store for us next season
6903199 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice
6903200 if the situation which exists now stays the same oil production will start to decline seriously in two years
6903201 why because today those who work in the oil industry find it easier to take the cream off the existing fields than to find new fields
6903202 the russian government has few people with the mentality of statesmen
6903203 today the aim of many people is to become rich at the expense of the state
6903204 every russian who thinks is worried about this unfortunately there are no signs this will change
6903205 these days the economy is dependent on natural resource exports which is just a temporary bonanza these resources sooner or later will be depleted
6903206 if youre running gazprom a russian natural gas producer but you dont really own it then your interest is maximizing short term profits not long term development
6903207 if you look at most of the russian companies the energy companies thats precisely whats happened they have focused on profits or dividends and less so on long term development and replacing reserves
6903208 in relation to the paramilitaries mr moreno ocampo said he was concerned that there had been few convictions of paramilitary warlords despite the extradition of more than a dozen to the united states and a scandal over paramilitary ties among senior members of colombias political establishment
6903209 there will be a significant number of you murdered and disappeared we know that your population will not go above 1 million people in colombia we want popayan bogota and cali free of indians
6903210 chiquita says the reason they paid the money was because your people would kill them if they didnt is that true
6903211 they paid taxes because we were like a state in the area and because we were providing them with protection which enabled them to continue making investments and a financial profit
6903212 what would have happened to chiquita and its employees if they had not paid you
6903213 the truth is we never thought about what would happen because they did so willingly
6903214 yes they had a choice they could go to the local police or army for protection from the guerillas but the army and police at that time were barely able to protect themselves
6903215 dole and del monte say they never paid you any money
6903216 chiquita has been honest by acknowledging the reality of the conflict and the payments that it made the others also made payments not only international companies but also the national companies in the region
6903217 has anyone come down here from the united states to talk to you about dole or to talk to you about del monte or any other companies
6903218 no one has come from the department of justice of the united states to talk to us
6903219 i am taking the opportunity to invite the department of state and the department of justice so that they can come and so i can tell them all that they want to know from us
6903220 how will the prosecution of those primarily responsible for crimes that are under the jurisdiction of the icc translators note these are genocide crimes against humanity war crimes and aggression including political leaders and members of congress presumably linked to the demobilized paramilitaries be guaranteed in particular i would like to know if the investigations into crimes punishable under the rome statute will continue and if the extradition of the paramilitary leaders presents an obstacle to the effective investigation of the aforementioned politicians i should clarify that as of today there is no decision on opening an investigation the situation remains under the analysis of my office
6903221 the way i see it if and when it is approved it will be a niche product
6903222 sunlight helps us produce vitamin d but the amount of sunlight you need is so low that you could walk outside for probably five minutes and have enough
6903223 vitamin d deficiency i dont think is really all that common
6903224 you can also start suffering kidney disease and believe it or not once you go past a certain dose of vitamin d you can start clogging up the kidneys because theres too much calcium absorbed into the blood
6903225 the best way to go was to set up a foundation get an impressive board of top scientists to see if we can get some research going
6903226 we are very tunnel visioned in our view of consciousness we tend to direct our vision to technical advances like things that have got us to the moon
6903227 the study of consciousness is so central to our happiness survival and creativity its a mistake not to explore scientifically the potential benefits this compound might yield
6903228 to deny science a valuable tool like psychedelics is just myopic its ignoring a good possibility to learn more about the brain our master tool and how these substances can be used as an aid in psychotherapy
6903229 in a scientific age we need to give scientific explanations to overcome taboos
6903230 derivatives and drugs based on changing their molecules may well have benefits
6903231 what motivates me is that i feel its an area where one can contribute a real benefit to humanity
6903232 well are you gonna fix this for me what am i supposed to do

6903234 die weltmacht amerika dem l und gasriesen russland noch immer milit risch und wirtschaftlich haushoch berlegen erlebt derzeit ein albtraum szenario
6903235 pl tzlich diktiert nicht washington sondern moskau das geschehen auf der weltpolitischen b hne s dossetien m chte unabh ngig von georgien werden bitte sch n sagen die russen autonomie war f r uns doch schon immer ein h chstwichtiges weil basisdemokratisches gut
6903236 was muss ich alles daher quatschen damit ich zum schotter komme und meinen job mache
6903237 au er verbalem s belrasseln einem eingefrorenen nato russland rat und der aufk ndigung einiger gemeinsamer man ver haben die vereinigten staaten an drohpotential gegen moskau nichts zu bieten auch der hastig unterzeichnete us raketenpakt mit warschau ist nicht viel mehr als eine geste amerikanischer verzweiflung nach dem motto wir geben euch nicht auf riskieren aber im ernstfall keinen milit rischen konflikt mit moskau
6903238 demokraten und republikanern ist es gleicherma en ein grauen dass ab sofort herr putin und seine marionetten bestimmen k nnten wer in zukunft mitglied der nato oder der europ ischen union wird zum beispiel im fall der ukraine es ist nur noch eine frage der zeit bis russland den krimstaat am strategisch wichtigen schwarzen meer in hnlicher weise zu kolonialisieren versucht wie georgien
6903239 doch selbst hardliner john mccain der russland am liebsten noch an diesem wochenende aus dem wichtigen kreis der m chtigen g8 staaten ausschlie en w rde muss erkennen amerika ist von russland viel abh ngiger als moskau von washington denn ohne russlands hilfe sind amerikas brandherde nicht zu l schen zum beispiel in iran bereits jetzt r stet moskau die mullahs in teheran massiv mit raketenabwehrsystemen auf eine f r amerika und seinen engsten verb ndeten israel brandgef hrliche situation
6903240 wir tuns wir tuns jaaaaa wir tuns echt nein doch wirklich sehet her sehet her sehet heeer
6903241 gleichzeitig kann die un vetomacht russland jederzeit alle versuche aushebeln den iran konflikt diplomatisch zu l sen auch in afghanistan kann russland die amerikaner noch st rker in die defensive zwingen als sie es ohnehin schon sind etwas druck auf kirgistan reicht aus und schon verlieren die usa eine ihrer wichtigsten operationsbasen gegen die taliban in afghanistan iran afghanistan nordkorea russland kann alle diese krisen sch ren und gef hrliche stellvertreterkriege f hren
6903242 der schaden w re f r washington deutlich gr er als f r moskau syriens pr sident baschar al assad hat die gunst der stunde f r alle amerikagegner bereits begriffen und in dieser woche schon einmal in russland neue waffensysteme geordert der kalte krieg kehrt in raten zur ck den usa bleibt nur eine hoffnung dass russlands milliardenschwere oligarchen um ministerpr sident putin kein interesse an einem dauer konflikt mit den usa haben weil sie lieber dollar scheffeln als ihren reichtum in einem neuen kalten krieg zu verlieren

6903253 justice for the pains he bravo has done and justice for the people and i am willing for that to happen because it will open our hearts and minds i also accept the fact that he had done terroristic activities
6903254 with that bounty i hope that bravo and kato will be brought to justice
6903255 it is not because they are muslims but it is because they have done criminal acts
6903256 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
6903257 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
6903258 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
6903259 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
6903260 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
6903261 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
6903262 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
6903263 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive
6903264 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
6903265 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help

6903275 if you see anyone in trouble in the water or are in trouble yourself then do not delay in dialling 999 and asking for the coastguard

6903281 the citys residents cough their eyes burn a sticky wet film forms on everything dust particles nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide concentrations rise to dramatic levels the authorities send out text messages to warn asthma sufferers to stay indoors and close the windows
6903282 thus it wouldnt surprise me to find that they dont seem to be removing entire questions since there are plenty of pointy ones still in there but it doesnt stretch the imagination too far to picture them editing the responses or softening charged language
6903283 i hope the government panel in the peace negotiation will be replaced because of their previous actions concerning the questioned memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain or moa ad
6903284 the government should just throw the whole moa ad away and just create a new one they should revamp the whole moa
6903285 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
6903286 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
6903287 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
6903288 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
6903289 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
6903290 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
6903291 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
6903292 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
6903293 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
6903294 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
6903295 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
6903296 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
6903297 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
6903298 there is an imminent crisis that must be handled properly and curbed as soon as possible otherwise the peace process will eventually collapse
6903299 if the government is true to its word of upholding the primacy of the peace process then the government must do something swiftly for the ball is also in its hand but of course joint efforts within the context and parameters of the process are imperative this is the best time to prove the political will of the government in finding ways to peacefully resolve the conflict in mindanao and the bangsamoro problem
6903300 okay what was the first topic i learned in this chapter section etc what was the second

6903305 we have only just begun to tap the potential of these microorganisms our undergraduates have given us a peek at the treasure these habitats hold and we need to move quickly to preserve them
6903306 clearly the inner tissues of plants are a biological niche for microbial life that warrants further exploration
6903307 it is a niche that can be readily explored by undergraduate students the potential to explore something so completely unknown gets the students very excited about science

6903333 we are deeply disappointed and when a decision was to be made on sunday we think south africa made a hasty choice now its up to the icc to take a decision but i would say south africas refusal will hurt the event
6903334 we are aware of south africas decision but we will comment only after discussing various aspects of the issue during the icc board teleconference on sunday

6903403 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6903404 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6903405 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6903406 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6903407 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6903408 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others

6903411 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6903412 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6903413 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6903414 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently

6903440 the car this morning in the dry had a little bit of understeer and we didnt do a lot of laps
6903441 we were able to get plenty of track time in the damp during the afternoon and it was very challenging to drive lots of power so you have to be very careful after another day in the car now im really starting to feel comfortable

6903471 for decades the typical approach of hospitals and their insurance carriers was shut up and literally break off communications with the family
6903472 everybody thinks patients and families are out for blood out to sue the truth is they want somebody to level with them and they want to make sure it doesnt happen again

6903489 he will bash bush and remind people that they were better off when democrats last ran the white house
6903490 bill clinton does not think barack obama will be a great president and he doesnt want to say so
6903491 but hes a pro hell give an endorsement he also likes doing things last minute and he likes to just go out there and say whats on his mind

6903588 i was in an outdoor stadium more like a performance hall or coliseum
6903589 there was this one section that stood out brilliantly to me in the dream and i knew i was supposed to be seated there
6903590 at this point i was down front close to the stage but i knew i must be repositioned for this important meeting instead of just taking the easy way climbing over others by zigzagging and running to secure my seats i went all the way back to the entryway and went through the gate and turnstile again i waited on the three people in front of me as i was waiting on this pathway or concourse that you walk on i stepped out to the aisle and there were children on the ground playing with toys they obviously had some clear plastic toys that were now totally broken into many parts and pieces they were all over the pathway these pieces looked like clear broken glass i thought ive got to go to my seats so i will just step on all the broken parts and keep going i felt the plastic pieces getting into my feet i stopped and grabbed the next post in wonderment shaking my head wondering why all this broken stuff was on this pathway or aisle i was just sitting there plucking it out of my feet and i woke up
6903591 i have destined a place for you in the midst of my positioning you are halfway you are between redemption and purity
6903592 i am blowing new vision on you to show you your place of authority for this next season do not enter in the gate through an invalid way or hurry past the protocol that has been developed for your safety watch the authorities that i have positioned to help you into this next seat of authority
6903593 when you see your position find your way fully through and into your next place even though much immaturity has torn up and broken the gifts that i am releasing and cluttered the path to where my people will be seated to rule in days ahead
6903594 walk on top of that immaturity and do not allow that which my children have used wrongly to stop you
6903595 i will redeem your place in the midst of those who have broken rank and run ahead of my perfect timing this will not prevent me from gathering again those who are willing to hear my call i am preparing the places of broken abused and unfulfilled destinies and will reseat my faithful ones that will lead on into the future harvest awaits and i will not be stopped
6903596 for if you remain righteous in your acts and character the lord who knows your way will direct you in a straight path the wicked will perish so do not join yourself with those who are doing wrong for ungodly gain stay true to our lord in this season and you will prosper
6903597 who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases
6903598 jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever
6903599 god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and power and how he went about doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because god was with him
6903600 jesus went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness among the people
6903601 then jesus said to his disciples therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear
6903602 do not be afraid little flock for your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom
6903603 but for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings and you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall

6903606 there are several points of the reform causing concern among industrialists and one of the most pressing is the point dealing with special areas for state investment
6903607 the mining authority will establish the economic considerations and the royalties required by law which the bidder must pay
6903608 it will lay out the general procedures along with the conditions and requirements to be considered in selecting the holder of the mining permit in each case
6903609 some sectors related to mining have suggested that the rules of the game be clear regarding contracting if they arent the government will have broad freedoms to award concessions in special areas
6903610 if traditional mining came first and you dont report it the contract will have reason to lapse so that it can be awarded to the traditional miners
6903611 the unsettling part is how illegal mining is favored it doesnt make sense to reward mining activity performed without a mining permit instead of rights acquired by parties that can perform responsible mining on a medium and large scale
6903612 in terms of state mediation its unacceptable that a mining project in areas overrun by illegal mining should be politicized that is a very sensitive point for a mining project ideally the state would support sustainable mining under a legal framework
6903613 con las personas violentas y que realizan actos terroristas hay que ser muy duros aplicarles todo el rigor de la ley y mi impresi n es que hasta ahora el gobierno ha sido d bil en eso porque sino no podemos comprender que un fundo haya sido quemado 30 veces eso quiere decir que algo est faltando y lamentablemente en esto hay que ser muy duro
6903614 la ley tiene que aplicarse y al gobierno no le puede temblar la mano
6903615 no pueden pagar justos por pecadores y quienes est n incitando a la violencia obviamente tienen que deben ser tratados con toda la dureza que corresponde
6903616 from what we see they are continuing to support multi family in a disciplined way
6903617 i do believe there is a good chance that the private equity deal will happen because it is a good buy for them buy when shares are low
6903618 the private equity money is good money and it will help stabilize and bring integrity back to the markets my feeling is that if somebody thinks its a good investment then psychologically or because of the money going into it this move will have a positive impact a fed bailout would certainly be less positive
6903619 prices were high and buying an apartment was an insane proposition similarly the mortgage industry wasnt functioning based on reality anymore it was going crazy and it wasnt safe now things are definitely normalizing if someone says they have a lot of money they have to show it
6903620 in general however i do agree with the sentiment that a private equity investment would be better than the fed coming in and bailing out the companies with taxpayers money

6903625 nos parecen positivos los anuncios del ministerio de hacienda sin duda que esto va a significar un peque o alivio para los bolsillos de todos los chilenos
6903626 es decir disminuir la carga tributaria de los chilenos y buscar f rmulas que dinamicen la econom a de nuestro pa s sin impactar la inflaci n
6903627 que no solamente incidir positivamente en el control de la inflaci n sino que significar ahorros que las familias podr n destinar al consumo de otros productos cuyos precios se han elevado
6903628 esta es una medida que la cpc largamente ha sugerido y creemos que hay espacio para que el l mite propuesto de 5 000 utm de ventas anuales para acogerse al beneficio se aumente significativamente de esta forma el universo de empresas que podr a estar en condiciones de reinvertir sus utilidades ser a mayor generando m s empleo y contribuyendo as al crecimiento del pa s

6903653 the companys management and the union both agree on the need to continue with the line 5 project and construction is being considered along with some other projects the company is carrying out with the government right now
6903654 which gives us the certainty that the line will be built
6903655 we have a lot of points left in the game
6903656 we know what we need to do i think they have more to lose than us were going to be fighting
6903657 if there is one point between us even if at sometimes it looks impossible and right now its not even going to have the faith were going to continue working
6903658 joking aside the good news is nobody got hurt and things can definitely be replaced
6903659 but when you go back to the truck its hard to forget a lot of our tools that we would be able to use here are gone the good news is team penske is always prepared we already had a truck that came from charlotte stuff that well be able to use now
6903660 you just have to keep focused on what youre trying thats the biggest thing for us making sure that we make as many points as we can at any opportunity at least then you know youve done your best even if somebody takes you out of it
6903661 hes very competitive and penske is a team that has won many races a lot of championships a lot of indy 500s so theyve definitely got the equipment and the drivers to do it
6903662 look at helio hes come second seven times this year so easily he could have won some races hes on top of his game
6903663 the good news is that im very comfortable with the road courses
6903664 the bad news is he is also very comfortable with the road courses
6903665 from what they tell me as soon as scott dixon starts the race on sunday he will have 12 points for sure and that will eliminate me from contention
6903666 right now im just working on winning some races for the team
6903667 once you win the championship it isnt real important if you finish second third or fourth
6903668 when im at a racetrack the cameras are rolling and there are many things that become a story because ive been fortunate to have people following me since very early in my indycar career
6903669 its like when you tune into a golf game you want to know how tigers doing
6903670 i just have to be conscious of that i just have to be aware that people are always watching and especially young people are watching
6903671 i think as i mature as a driver i understand a little bit better what i need out of the car and am able to do what i need to do on the track to go fast
6903672 omar is a champion baseball player and hes well respected not only in our country but around the world
6903673 we met back in our hometown and im honored that he wanted to come out to the track and learn more about hvm racing and the indycar series
6903674 being in the pits and watching everything develop was great its more exciting when you watch it so close it seems really demanding and takes a lot of responsibility e j has always taken the challenge well

6903679 my dearest darling angel i read your letter and tears came to my eyes it made me love you even more and i knew you truly were sent to me by god the lord had kept you alive because he knew that someday you could be an encouragement and uplifting a very special person a loving angel for me after i read your letter i fell to my knees prayed unto him to forgive me for being so selfish i had no problems praise him for giving you to me my faith was restored by just reading your testimony lisa i most dearly love you lisa you are the woman i have prayed for the woman god has sent me to live out my life with the lord has given me life again he forgave me for turning away from him then accepted me back in the flock lisa i love you i got to close for now john 3 16 i thank god he also gave me you
6903680 he is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us
6903681 for others its laziness youre too lazy to work and support your children im talking about men you call yourself mr mom god calls you a bum st paul says you are worse than an infidel let me look you right in the eye and tell you that hell is your future home if all you do is sit on your backside and let your wife support you in your life

6903686 it would be easy to write this off as a harry potter clone
6903687 except that it looks far far darker in tone than any of the potter films have been so far much more in line with fantasy pictures from the late eighties than anything current only with much better production values

6903709 for whatever reason my back is really guarding against letting that spasm out

6903715 always do right this will gratify some people and astonish the rest
6903716 theres no limit to what you can accomplish if you dont care who gets the credit
6903717 probably the most significant factor in this reevaluation has been the success of the surge in iraq
6903718 almost all the experts said it wouldnt work and it did work and the evidence is everywhere when a president is right and all of his critics are wrong sooner or later voters who are not hard partisans recognize that and give the president credit
6903719 the foreign policies in place now are more sensible moderate and mainstream
6903720 in many cases the next president should follow rather than reverse them
6903721 i think were getting hints of the image rehabilitation that will inevitably come but it wont come until some time in the next presidency or two
6903722 it generally takes time for peoples partisan feelings to abate and for people to look back and take a fresh view of an old presidency

6903731 were still having the build out for web related kinds of content
6903732 theres a battle between google yahoo amazon ebay and microsoft to generate more content for the web microsoft is trying to build out a huge cloud of infrastructure with x86 servers to support that
6903733 replacement cycles of other products like mainframes and unix servers are generating sales
6903734 and the company executing the best on that has been ibm ibm had a relatively good quarter worldwide that helped them in the revenue area
6903735 that system alone has the capacity to replace nearly 15 x86 servers with a smaller footprint lower energy costs and much higher security control and automation
6903736 sun has tried to be innovative but if i compare them to an hp hp is really focused on business
6903737 im wondering about sun related to servers and whether theyre focused on execution they need to really execute effectively in these markets they have a lot going on technologically but they need a stronger focus on taking those advantages and turning them into business results
6903738 u s performance in general isnt as strong as the worldwide market
6903739 first the server market is a trailing indicator of economic issues and usually trails it by two or three quarters because the purchase cycle for server technology is so long it can take up to two years in an extreme example for a business to complete a big server purchase
6903740 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6903741 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
6903742 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6903743 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6903744 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6903800 the only explanation that makes sense is that he really does have a surprise pick or hes trying to convince someone to join the ticket
6903801 im of the view that at this point waiting is a good thing
6903802 obviously the announcements going to get a lot of attention but its very important to build interest for the convention the closer the announcement is to the convention the more newsy the convention is
6903803 this time you had the olympics intruding and not getting a sustained ride but having it peter out
6903804 things move so quickly that the inevitable negative front would have come in 48 hours in this case the convention occurring within 48 hours will cut off the inevitable scrutiny of the vice presidential pick
6903805 every day that goes by not only do you step on your own message but you forfeit the opportunity to have a candidate hitting four media markets a day
6903806 every dollar spent on candidate travel is much more highly leveraged than candidate ads so theyre giving all that up by waiting this long
6903807 he wanted to create buzz and thats exactly what he did
6903808 im in california everyones pulling out their cell phones hoping they want to be the first to know
6903809 there has been anticipation for days that the vice presidential announcement would happen toward the end of the week
6903810 we may wait until wednesday and do it right at the convention
6903811 its sort of like a long movie about the civil war we know who won if they did it friday evening at 5 30 they would dominate the evening news olympics or no olympics if they do it tomorrow it will dominate tomorrow and sunday and well move on as we go into the convention but it doesnt matter a whit to the outcome of the election i think we are consumed by this here we are sitting here talking about it
6903812 the obama campaign has been masterful in building suspense and then like any good production there has to be a payoff at the end
6903813 they have done a masterful job in owning the media attention over the pick and understanding the presss fascination and obsession with the processes
6903814 a lot of the success of this is based on stagecraft the first 24 to 48 hours is the crucial period in informing the publics conception of the pick
6903815 the attention span of the media has gotten so short now that you cant drive a vice presidential pick for a week
6903816 the story gets more and more absurd every four years its underwhelming by definition
6903817 absent an inexplicable lapse in judgment these picks when all is said and done are never the most important things that happen during the campaign
6903818 they might have delayed it one day because they were enjoying the mccain house meltdown

6903862 everything about it rewarded my ego money medical insurance praise
6903863 now i am more god oriented and no more egooriented
6903864 in the world there is an interior pulse of anxiety
6903865 the more you hang around the nuns the more you become one
6903866 the vast majority of economists agree that capitalism is the most sound system there is for producing wealth and responding to demand
6903867 although js is never going to replace the server side website completely not if you care about accessibility anyway
6903868 in the fall of 2002 bush and his white house were engaging in a carefully orchestrated campaign to shape and manipulate sources of public approval to our advantage
6903869 the phony bush lied story line distracts from the biggest prewar failure the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which bush and rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically catastrophically wrong
6903870 in my experience the great majority of cases of actual politicization successful politicization are invariably subtle
6903871 the desire to avoid the unpleasantness of putting unwelcome assessments on the desks of policymakers
6903872 false information from the iraqi national congress inc affiliated sources was used to support key intelligence community assessments on iraq and was widely distributed in intelligence products prior to the war
6903873 a source who may have information related to the alleged sale
6903874 a contact with excellent access who does not have an established reporting record
6903875 this unremarkable report was disseminated but because it produced no solid answers there wasnt any urgency to brief its results to senior officials such as the vice president
6903876 in many ways we were prisoners of our own history
6903877 the u s rush to war against iraq marked the worst intelligence scandal in the history of the united states
6903878 the dark side interview john mclaughlin january 11 2006 p 16 http www pbs org wghb pages frontline darkside interviews mclaughlin html
6903879 the verse has no clear meaning if god was certain that abraham would fear him before he offered up his son
6903880 for the lord searches all hearts and understands every intent of the thoughts
6903881 even before there is a word on my tongue behold o lord you know it all
6903882 he abraham considered that god is able to raise people even from the dead from which he also received him back as a type
6903883 where can i go from your spirit or where can i flee from your presence
6903884 your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad
6903885 they built their high places of baal in the valley of the son of hinnom to offer up their sons and daughters to molech though i did not command them nor did it enter into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin
6903886 if you have gastroenteritis conditions a lot of nausea vomiting diarrhea youre going to need an iv we have extra bags of saline and we have more equipment to start those ivs
6903887 you have a hundred people in a church basement eating day and half old egg salad sandwiches thats what i think we may see a lot of
6903888 we have to increase the inspections just because of the sheer volume of events going on
6903889 if something were going on we would detect it as early as possible so that we could start preventing further illness
6903890 from a community point of view theyre not just getting the standard graphs where you see temperature going up or the global average which doesnt really mean a lot to a lot of people
6903891 theyll be able to find out as a community what the implications of climate change will be on them and how it might increase the flood risk but then we want to see how they can adapt to that and make changes to the river
6903892 he started off loud and got progressively louder as the meal went on
6903893 taking conspicuous glances at him before rushing back to their tables to discuss how hot dempsey is in person
6903894 filled with hipsters girls with flashy jewelry and loud music
6903895 that case was resolved and as part of the resolution was dismissed
6903896 the information is so intertwined with things that fall into our confidentiality protocol that we cant comment on this

6903904 noooooooo the book is finally finished i cannot possibly add five characters each with a complicated storyline
6903905 she goes running for the shelter of a mothers benzo org uk leo sternbach the father of mothers
6903906 dear burt while you always had quite a flair for the dramatic you never had much regard for the truth apparently you cant be bothered to read anything carefully maybe that is why you like oreilly make half your crap up glad to hear you finally got sober
6903907 no vieron la foto del caballero bush no son montajes se meti tremenda pea ebriedad compadre tuvieron que sacarlo de la cancha que era de v ley playa bush baj a la cancha y quer a tocar a las muchachas se volvi loco bueno m s de lo que normalmente es ese es el jefe de imperio estados unidos vaya qu peligro

6903910 ojal que llegue a la presidencia de estados unidos un hombre serio ahora en noviembre con quien se pueda hablar que no sea un borracho que respete al mundo y que no sea un loco
6903911 todos los imperios tienen su fin se acab el imperio romano se acab el imperio ingl s se acab el imperio espa ol se acab el imperio portugu s pero ah est portugal ah est espa a ah est inglaterra ah est roma esos pa ses nunca se van a acabar ah estar siempre washington y ese gran pa s que es estados unidos pero el imperio se acaba y se acabar el imperio yanqui que tanto da o le ha hecho al mundo
6903912 unirse como hermano con el resto del mundo para construir un mundo mejor un mundo de justos de iguales y de paz
6903913 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6903914 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6903915 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6903916 im sure hell make a wonderful choice for our party and for our country and well just have to wait until next friday to find out the answer to those questions
6903917 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6903918 if there is a major economic crisis policymakers are under pressure to respond the appropriate immediate response is not necessarily to blanket the entire country with resources be it income or subsidized food but to target resources to those people who need them the most
6903919 apparently the average person is able to do quite well in the face of economic shocks that are relatively short lived
6903920 quantities of starches and dairy are essentially unchanged across the entire sample period in contrast fruit and vegetables consumption appears to have adjusted entirely to income variation in terms of quantities
6903921 in the case of meat however the picture is more nuanced expenditures declined throughout the 1990s with a large decline in 1998 in 2000 expenditures rose but remained below their level in the mid 1990s
6903922 overall the evidence suggests that individuals and households are very resilient even in the face of major economic upheavals and that they optimize over many dimensions of well being
6903923 the kind of household adaptability we find in the emerging economy of russia could be applied to more advanced nations and to developing nations as well
6903924 we would expect american households to make similar lifestyle changes in response to rising gas and food prices and we have seen similar responses to the asian economic crisis by indonesian families
6903925 through relevant i reach a demographic that has strong faith morals and passion but disagreements politically
6903926 it wouldnt be wise for me to be seen as picking a political side when ive consistently said both sides are right in some areas and wrong in some areas
6903927 this generation of values voters doesnt necessarily need to draw political battle lines the way previous generations have and that we can work through areas of disagreement toward common goals
6903928 i have a lot of problems with the way this loan was written
6903929 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6903930 the foreigners have to realise that everyone in afghanistan has weapons but that doesnt mean they are taliban
6903931 often the taliban and extremist groups are very quick to get out there and violence that they perpetrated they blame on the us or our allies
6903932 john is a watch guru he tried on this skeleton watch which is worth about 10 000 and even asked for our presidents card
6903933 hes such an incredible musician were just so happy to see each others careers grow
6903934 whenever theyre in the same town john is sure to go to jamess tournaments and james is always at his concerts
6903935 he even offered music advice for our 4 year old daughter i asked him what would be the best instrument for her to learn and he said if she can learn piano she can learn to play guitar horns and the basic chords in music
6903936 mainly for men who are exhausted by the summers heat
6903937 voulez vous quon fasse exploser une arme qui est un mini soleil
6903938 the people are innocent they do not know what the scientists are doing they are only praising the feat of scientists innocently but the scientists are fully aware that it is not a project without a grave risk to the life of the earth
6903939 after 50 months the earth to a centimeter would have shrunk it would be nothing more there not only no more life there but also the earth would be a small black hole
6903940 whoever sees the higgs boson for example first theyll be the ones to get the nobel prize there are 2 000 scientists working on this project and every single one of them would die to see it completed said nessi
6903941 take the very survival of all life on earth on the truth of their zpe stuff a gamble
6903942 if there was a black hole at the interaction point we could very easily detect a huge drop in the rate of events within a millisecond from 40 mhz to 100 hz and turn off the accelerator
6903943 it is true the trees have been knocked down the trees were on ms tomlins property she was advised by the arborist to remove them because they were a hazard to people on the premises they could potentially tip over and kill someone her attorney and police were present at the time to make sure things were done accordingly
6903944 vincent is one of the outstanding talents in europe he understands the ambition of the club he understands where we want to take the club we want to be a young vibrant team with energy and technical ability he comes into the category of the kind of young player we are trying to attract
6903945 that will help the team as the premier league is a long hard season and there will be injuries unfortunately
6903946 the chance came at the right moment this is a club with a lot of ambition that helped me make my decision and i am looking forward to playing in the premier league
6903947 i had a good feeling about this move when you feel they are dynamic people at city who know a lot about football you realise you are in a good environment to improve your game
6903948 the deal is not dead yet its in the hands of the powers that be at the two clubs and we are trying to sort something out on our terms possibly a loan
6903949 shola is a premiership footballer and he has the quality that we are trying to bring to this club but hamstring injuries cant be taken lightly we saw that last season with shefki kuqi when he played 10 minutes pulled up and we never saw the best of him after that
6903950 okay when hes nearly reached his goal chuck this massive left turn in that should provide the most excruciating amount of torment possible hahahahahahaahaha
6903951 i have never really cared for the birla temple for its security guards who hover not very far from you once you enter its marble floor and enormous chandelier its expansive air of a lobby in a four star hotel its spotless garish unimpeachable idols
6903952 the domain of culture unlike the domain of religion belongs to the modern in a way that doesnt presume or demand allegiance or belief surely the principal project of hindutva is to destroy this domain of culture that was created in modernity
6903953 mankind flung its advance agents ever outward it flung them like stones
6903954 our lawsuit is really much more of an appeal than a lawsuit its an appeal for mercy from the federal government
6903955 were not asking to break the law were asking to have another avenue for relief
6903956 they may be able to show that the federal government deliberately is seeking to frustrate the states ability to determine whether an individuals use of marijuana is permissible under california law
6903957 the federal government can enforce its own laws but it cant tell the states what laws they can enact
6903958 if they cant do that they also cant use their law enforcement to sabotage the state laws they dont like
6903959 those steps all make it impossible for california and its government to enforce state laws
6903960 if something occurs in front of us were going to act
6903961 we expect police to abide by this very logical recommendation
6903962 if police expect the taxpayers to cover their 1 2 million in overtime during the dnc it is only fair that they respect the laws adopted by those taxpayers
6903963 there will be plenty for police to do during the dnc aside from arresting or citing adults who are simply making the safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol
6903964 theres no way for the recommendation to be binding but it was issued by a panel appointed by the mayor so we would expect it to be treated as a pronouncement from the mayor
6903965 government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem
6903966 this crop has potential to be a good reward to the agriculture sector
6903967 we can use this as a vehicle to drive this whole new sector
6903968 its a win every way for everyone that is using it
6903969 they are already using it in europe it is just a matter of bringing it here and actually doing it
6903970 they could smoke this stuff until the cows come home and nobody would get high
6903971 there is another chemical that would provide a terrible headache
6903972 in my first couple of years they probably stole two acres from a 10 acre site
6903973 the worry is hemp will be used as a blind for other plant material
6903974 that same barrier is whats keeping the americans out of the market
6903975 they cant get it unless they bring it on a boat from europe
6903976 the americans have no problem with us sending hemp fibre
6903977 there is no use getting the farm community engaged until we have a market well defined and a processing plant that can buy it
6903978 there is a strong indication this could be a major development for this area
6903979 i dnt no who the fuk u think u dealin wit u will neva be heard from one phone call is all i gotta make no try me sho me
6903980 the good angelica loves her family works hard goes to church on sundays and is always nice to people

6903982 the good angelica loves her family works hard goes to church on sundays and is always nice to people
6903983 the naughty angelica will never get married because she loves sex so much and she
6903984 i like attention i love men i like the glam outfits and the role playing i love being able to go nude in front of strangers i want them to enjoy my body i like to make men laugh in clubs i like to talk to them at stage side when theyre watching me dance
6903985 when i get horny and i want some hard fuckin ill make sure that you know right away
6903986 i will stick my ass in your face arch my back and purr ill grind my ass
6903987 were trying to establish who is the beneficiary of the funds raised at the dinner
6903988 we learned that quite some hundreds of millions of naira were raised
6903989 the dinner concert held on august 11 was a relaxed atmosphere designed to sensitise and mobilise africans worldwide and other eligible u s citizens to register and vote instead of passively watching history be made
6903990 georgia power is taking an important step toward continued diversification of its fuel sources and making renewable energy more affordable for customers
6903991 by converting plant mitchell to biomass we hope to not only help grow the renewable resource base in georgia but also to expand the market for renewable energy credits which ultimately will foster additional renewable energy development
6903992 history is being made in the united states of america
6903993 our own kinsman an african american senator barack obama has scaled up the political ladder of the most powerful country in the world as the presidential flag bearer on the platform of the democratic party it is against this background
6903994 that a group of concerned citizens of african extraction gathered together under the aegis of africans for obama 2008 a non partisan group who decided to organize this forum as a way of creating more awareness in the african setting in general and for our people in diaspora in particular to exercise their voting right
6903995 after careful re consideration of the amethyst initiative i am withdrawing my support to lower the drinking age from 21 to 18 morehouse does not condone the misuse or abuse of alcohol or illegal substances while we welcome and encourage spirited public debate about appropriate standards of behavior we do not support policies that would have the effect of encouraging or making it more likely that younger citizens would use alcohol or drugs
6903996 little gti youre so much fun i love to drive you
6903997 hola a todos hoy tengo buenas noticias puedo anunciar que tom y yo estamos esperando un bebe y somos muy felices
6903998 behind every good woman is a man wondering where all the good women are
6903999 i know something you dont know i know something you dont know
6904000 no i never said that i want to be the v p but has anyone seen my cell phone i need to check my text messages
6904001 mmm ahhh ooooo sorry im just receiving a text from the obama campaign and my phone is set on vibrate mode
6904002 im sorry fellas my staff and i were awake all night helping john mccain count his houses
6904003 yes he took ambien last night but spent the last 6 hours sleepwalking driving and eating unfortunately he consumed half of a turkey and now hes paying for it
6904004 heres the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely vp names all of this while dressed in gold like this mother the youngest of the press in curls
6904005 heres the story of a man named anderson who was busy with three pundits of his own they were four men living on the press plane but they were all alone
6904006 great work you did it youre interviewing me for no reason have you tried the cotton candy
6904007 fooled ya ill be home in a few with some mickey ds love bill
6904008 the turkey crepes at brunch were spectacular although that much triptophine before noon probably isnt a good thing wouldnt you agree thomas
6904009 well about the vp pick i just hope i dont get
6904010 for the last time i dont have any vp information for you the only thing i know is that i need a beer
6904011 monica lewinski that is my v p choice and we shall smoke cigars and rule the world
6904012 what can i say guys i woulda wiped the floor with mccain but now were seeing your golden boys star begin to fall
6904013 guys lets all close our eyes and pray senator obama chooses me for vp
6904014 yes i did get a call but im not telling anyone guess i will be stuck here in new york with bill
6904015 maybe its his brother and theyre waiting for a visa
6904016 those recycle bins are just bursting at the curbs throughout the city
6904017 a black hole is a region of space in which the gravitational field is so powerful that nothing not even light can escape its pull after having fallen past its event horizon
6904018 i was talking to a ml scout the other day i wont say who it was but he said the yanks need to start winning some game
6904019 we can do the same things that ibm and accenture do just not with as many people in as many locations
6904020 we offer a choice so customers dont always have to go to those more famous names
6904021 this would not prevent very large powerful patent holders from rejecting offers
6904022 does this represent an overall shift in strategy do they have to find a new path to 270 electoral votes
6904023 does this represent a sign of things to come in other states is the obama campaign planning to close down offices in states they have initially targeted
6904024 china has used the olympics to clamp down on protesters and dissidents
6904025 apple just opened its first store in china and is negotiating right now to be able to sell the iphone there
6904026 apple has given the government all the excuse it needs not only to block the itunes music store but to raise extra barriers on permits for further apple retail stores to throw barriers in the path of apples iphone deals with state controlled carriers and to make the creation of a chinese itunes music store and app store a distant dream unless they let the carriers run it
6904027 not to mention make the lives of thousands of dedicated apple customers here in china just a little more miserable especially those of us who count on itunes as our sole source of legitimate non pirated music
6904028 with that smug smear artist with a truly punchable face joe scarborough and
6904029 that makes your average obama supporter want to climb some random clock tower and pick off innocents one by one
6904030 i suddenly started to wonder what would be the common theme unifying the speakers at my funeral
6904031 every time she mistakenly took it upon herself to inject sexy pillow talk into the equation
6904032 as he attempted to lecture me on the dangers of speeding
6904033 in the woods behind the respective reception hall is my ongoing habit of threatening the lives of reception djs who insist on playing music that simply isnt up to my particular standards
6904034 sorry but that t pain cd was a deal breaker
6904035 yeah baby thats it right there damn id be enjoying this so much more if you didnt carelessly quote young jeezy earlier

6904041 when life is too good we think too highly of ourselves and our blessings then we decide we are the wisest and the favored ones and we dont think we need wakan tanka and the helpers anymore
6904042 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unaware
6904043 love seeketh not itself to please nor for itself hath any care but for another gives its ease and builds a heaven in hells despair
6904044 when life is too good we think too highly of ourselves and our blessings then we decide we are the wisest and the favored ones and we dont think we need wakan tanka and the helpers anymore
6904045 instead of allowing yourself to be so unhappy just let your love grow as god wants it to grow seek goodness in others love more persons more love them more impersonally more unselfishly without thought of return the return never fear will take care of itself
6904046 were disappointed with the way we started we prided ourselves last season on being disciplined and hard to beat
6904047 im delighted with the way we played but for the first 15 minutes we gifted them the game thats the disappointing thing

6904055 an incredible impossible mad place i tell you the thing does not belong to any world that you and i have lived and worked in it is part of our dream world
6904056 even the gnarled stones seemed alive on that mystical island skelligs monks must have communed with angels for their daily sustenance on such bare rock
6904057 as i climbed the path winding up to the ancient constructions near the top of skelligs cliff i sensed that i was on the threshold of something utterly unique though i was by no means a stranger to monasteries which i had visited throughout europe and even farther afield at one time and another but nothing in my experience had prepared me for this huddle of domes crouching halfway to heaven in this all but inaccessible place with an intimidating immensity of space all around where it was easy to feel that you had reached a limit of this world a holy place to be sure which would still have been holy even if it had never known the consecrated life of prayer
6904058 greetings i am metatron lord of light i embrace each of you in light in love dear ones i know each of you far more than you may realize and we savor these moments we share and now another precious moment brings us together uniting thoughts within the matrix of the unified field combining geometric thought patterns with desire with awareness and so do all things come together in the same way for all thoughts all things all beings are electromagnetic representations of consciousness of manifestation of all that ever was or ever will be and so some things some thoughts some creations travel at more rapid speeds more accelerated frequencies within the geometric matrix others are more dense and travel slower more sluggish but all the same they seem to arrive in perfect order aligned with the nature of their creation and creatorship you see for the universe the cosmos is perfection itself regardless of any dimensional interpretation or perception of it in a mechanical sense in quantum tangent all things in the unified field act precisely perfectly according to their nature their architectural integrity yet some are created at higher frequencies at higher vibratory resonance than others now it is the channels wish that we review that which is called the leylines these can be said to exist in various forms with differing degrees of refinement from multifarious forms of energy ley lines as they are called in your times are the energetic patterns that run both above and beneath the earth these circumnavigate the earth in a variety of ways based upon laws of mathematics upon geometries upon vibrational essence geological force electromagnetics and mineralogical fields they shift and they move and they have been utilized in myriad ways throughout the eons of space time in eras of greater understanding times of greater technology they have been traveled as highways utilizing enhancement of very refined energies through such understanding leylines had the capacity to be used as conduits of energy transferal and for communication since the fall of atlantis amplified utilization has ceased and the ability for sustaining this manner of usage was lost as a result the refined network is no longer intact so the ley lines are shorn in some areas torn in others and the highways and byways appear not to make sense you see they no longer completely connect across the globe now the base essence of leylines occurs from a natural source they are currents of telluric energy as these were refined some became coded amp engineered on new paradigms which you call fourth dimension amp fifth dimension these replace the old but not all have discovered them yet and that is appropriate you see extra terrestrials have assisted the earth in this effort those from sirius b have been instrumental in recent years in realigning this system for the ascension and indeed they were the architects of the original enhancement of the ley system established over 30 000 years ago now the system of leylines can be said to act as the nervous system of the living planet the planet also has what can be termed axial tonal lines meridians and chakras leylines are not constant many factors can cause their shift many factors add to their complex energy content or lack thereof tectonic stresses magma solar energy naturally occurring electromagnetic fields exerted by minerals such as quartz and even the decomposition of organic matter this creates heat and electrical charge you see these energies accumulate and flow along earth paths of conductivity either on slightly above or underneath the earths crust those regions and places on the earth high in natural metal or conductive mineral content will attract the current of these electromagnetic flows man made structures built to sacred geometry will also attract these flows almost all of the sacred geometric temples built by the asian roman greek egyptian and mayan have leylines passing through them some of these structures were built on leys others attracted them to them many points on leys form into vortex spirals vortexes form for several reasons the generally understood cause is the intersection of leylines we tell you they also naturally occur at points of tectonic stress at volcanoes around pinnacled and pyramidal mountains and around man made structures built to sacred geometry vortexes occur naturally at large mineral deposits basalt beds granitic batholiths river confluences and water falls you see these all project sub atomic plasma charged ions and electromagnetic fields this natural build of energy will spin by nature and thus the vortex occurs now we should clarify that vortexes are not portals and they do not evolve into portals although from your perspective it could appear as such because all portals will attract a vortex to them you see vortexes can become the distribution engines for both adamantine essence called akash and higher dimensional energies received through portals not all vortexes house portals but all portals have a vortex do you see your term ley is a relatively recent description coined to simply mean a straight line connecting two points but our metatronic term is much broader we define leylines as being the conscious crystalline aspect of the electromagnetic flow lines and currents that network the planet leylines are groomed energy flows of electromagnetic energy and in latitude of comparison can be said to serve as the nervous system of gaia the raw earth currents are called in your vernacular dragon lines as both leylines and dragon lines are electrical in nature they flow along paths of natural electrical conductors this electricity occurs naturally on your earth from multiple sources moving water such as waterfalls rain and breaking waves produce charges as does the decomposition of organic matter tectonic stress volcanics lightning solar heat and winds the very crust of the earths surface you live on with its electrically conducting gases metals semi conducting mineral crystals water soaked organic matter and electrolytes offers an excellent medium for maintaining and producing electrical currents the mineralogy of the strata below the surfaces conducts in kind charged ions are drawn to the ground and this high ionic concentration increases the intensity of earth currents through the electrode effect as a result static electricity flows parallel with the ground in an orthogonal quasi static electric field forming eddies and springs of electricity that become rivers of current that network the planet these streams of current flow along lines of conductive minerals such as iron gold copper and quartz bearing rock naturally it flows to mountains volcanoes waters and minerals and large deposits of other conductive formations and amasses through up and around powernodes as you are aware when these lines intersect a spinning vortex is created this electrical current as with all forms of conscious energy can be directed the first to do this were the scientist priest of atlantis whose origin is the pleades the patterns of raw earth currents or dragon lines were scientifically detected and mapped and esoterically imbued and consciously willed to flow in specific routes the atla ra scientist priest discovered that by flowing these energies through their arcturian crystals and magnetic transducers that they could be amplified refined and separated into forms of braided polarized crysto electric frequencies capable of creating anti gravity fields when spun in counter balanced vortexes in the technology of the golden age of atlantis these conscious crysto electrical lines became so technically refined that were used to create a labyrinth of tunnels for both communication and transport and crossed to form energy fields for varying purposes they were patterned to flow inside factories to energize the work force and in agricultural fields to stimulate plant and crop growth by routing them in conduits relayed and amplified through crystal power stations and natural telluric generators such as skellig michael in the former case they were used to assist in the broadcast of crystalline electric waves for use in powering homes the forefathers to the sect you term as the druids were descendants of the atla ra these scientist priests of the golden age of atlantis were devout learned men and women who understood the necessity of combining scientific law with the energy of the divine this was termed the law of one akin to what you now term the unified field although your current understanding of same does not include the sacred dear ones integral science must not cannot omit the sacred the divine the atla ra learned that certain of the crysto refined ley energies were capable of holding an intent and field of awareness a global network of this category of ley energy was put in place as the scientist priest discovered how to use natural powernodes as relay and amplification stations for this energy to retain a self generating sufficiency when these leys became integral with infinity apex points the divine aspect was imbued within their energy awareness this atla ra with assistance from pleadean acturian and sirius b masters created specific divine ley energy routes connecting major chakric points on the planet these could be programmed with sound frequencies and color to enhance the tranquility and well being of temples they could be crossed to create sacred energy vortexes skellig michael is one such area and although a remnant shadow of its original multi ley manifold capacity it remains one of the most intact in current times so in truth there were many types of ley system in atlantis some were entirely used for crysto electric power in various forms others the ones that still function albeit in fragments were the leys of divine awareness truly the most robust survivors of this system are the leys now referred to as the michael and mary lines indeed their level of intactness is due largely to the work of the druids who had escaped atlantis before the demise into existing monasteries in britain europe egypt and og the most prolific were the sects in britain and france who used antigravity aspects of leys and sound to assist in the formation of stone circles the michael leyline survived for myriad reasons it was amplified in stone circles and by the very cathedrals built on its course to sacred geometry it was not called the michael line in its inception rather it was referred to as the atlas line in atlantis and thoth line in egypt and og its pagan name was changed to that of michael and mary by the secret societies of savants to protect it from the church the freemasons who built cathedrals capable of amplifying ley energy utilized sacred geometry imminently almost all of the cathedrals and greek monuments were built to phi the golden ratio or mean directly on powernodes along leylines it should not surprise you to know that i lord metatron and archangels michael and mechelzidek were very much present in the time of atlantis but were called by different names you see we show our love equally to all humankind of all eras races religions and creed now as we have said previously in this assay leylines are not constant in time they shift and alter and so what was once a robust system is now quite diminished and fragmented the ley system currently is but a shadow of its former self and no longer completely circumnavigates the planet however the raw current does and many parts of it are indeed ley in nature and this system is currently under repair particularly by those of sirius b and many of you in multidimensional aspects of yourselves do you see like powernodes groomed into sacred sites dragon lines are quite capable of being imbued with energy from human kind and sacred sites and become polished into leylines now flow pattern of leys are quite specific generally speaking they will spiral counterclockwise up domed mountains above the equator and clockwise below it they flow upward in straight lines on pyramidal shaped mountains they spiral up conical peaks this is why mountain peaks contain very high frequencies when these currents pass through structures built to sacred geometry or through what you term sacred sites the currents absorb and radiate higher light when this occurs the leys assume a refined conscious nature capable of coded memory ley powerpoints energetically connect to the grid system and form a geometric matrix which in turn can attract to it higher dimensional energies these become meridian points and in some cases chakras of the living sentience of the earth each ley each sacred site can and does affect the human electromagnetic field additionally the light arcs amp angles from planets and stars will feed amp influence the areas of telluric energy pools called in your terms electrical or outward vortexes and can actually create depending on their alignment inward pull portals or openings that receive light energy from stellar and solar light photons as well as from planetary and higher dimensional grid lattices if one accepts the postulate that certain points of higher energy exist on the planet and that they do have a crystallized matrix that projects a specific geometric pattern then its can also be understood that these living energy sources communicate thru harmonic energy oscillations for example if one has a tuning fork in the key of c and then one plays a c note on a piano the musical vibration from the piano will also create a vibration in the tuning fork because of the law your scientists call harmonic oscillation harmonic oscillations between power points on earth and in higher dimensions are also so attuned to resonate to compatible harmonics just as your human body has sensory systems and organs that sustain the health of the physical body so it is with ley lines ley lines sustain the health of the physical earth now above the organs of the body you have meridian lines that bisect the body and as they do contribute to the wellness of the being which then transmits that energy into a different form then feeding the organs feeding the senses and the awareness now just as your human body undergoes changes so does the earth diversify and shift the ley system changes and adapts in kind we tell you that with the ongoing and coming graduation of the earth the heralded planetary ascension not only will the earth system of sensitivity adjust but so will that of the human now above the meridian system of the human body is what we term the axialtonal lines this is a term that is relative and quite new to your sphere you will not have heard it so much but it will become more and more well known the axialtonal lines are distinct lines which connect the emotional body the mental body the causal body and such to the ascended body and so it is with the earth the earth as well has axialtonal lines defined by both spiritual and celestial qualities again based upon sacred mathematics these touch in certain areas to the ley lines they touch but they do not rest upon them but they do intersect especially in places where the ley lines are torn and shorn and disconnected they act as bridges bridges from one dimension to another to bridge gaps in knowledge to bridge gaps in history to bridge gaps of energy that have been depleted or shorn as such you see now when you visit a conjunction of ley energy or sacred site or vortex complex you absorb the code of its unique message its unique geometry you carry within your field the energy of every sacred site every power point and every grid point on each continent you have visited you have the ability to connect them to yourself and to one another dear ones those of you termed earth keepers such as the channel that have been tugged to visit such places can visualize connecting them to the 144 grid and thereby assist in connecting them to the evolving grid and in the process you connect and activate yourself that segment which you call the michael line became imbued with divine light and drawn into power points and cosmic alignment points some 18 000 years ago as we have mentioned the michael line was originally called the atlas belt before it was given a judeo christian name yet the source energy is the same you see oh but there was divine wisdom in the name change how many christian cathedrals built with immaculate sacred geometry on the exact vector and cosmic alignment points of this transcendental current would have been so constructed if the leyline were considered pagan indeed the controlling church would have forbidden it and now despite their controls incredible temples exist on the perfect locations to amplify highjer dimensional energies energies that are unbound by any religous dogma other than pure celestial love in truth skellig michael is a temple one created by nature by the divinity of earth the structure of skellig michael is pyramidal in geometry and is particularly aligned with celestial energies it is composed of violet granite that carries the imprint of the human quest your geologists will know of this particular granite that is the rock foundation and energy of many sacred places the harmonic oscillation we spoke of earlier allows such mineralogical harmonics to be the fount of vibrational connection between these sites such harmonics occur not just in the mineralogy but also by means of geometry and light quotient we will say that skellig michael is not the original entry point of the michael leyline but it now appears to be so because the line no longer is fully connected to its full compliment skellig michael was one of the amplification or relay points of what you presently term the michael ley when it originally was manifolded into the atla belt you see it once encircled the planet it will again in the future but that is not yet completed nor is it the time we will say that its strongest portion extends from ireland through britain across europe and forks into the lands of ancient judea israel and egypt does it surprise you to know that it connects to mecca in saudi arabia it should not surprise you to know that most of you have had lifetimes in every race and every religion truth has a way of evolving within the hearts of all who truly seek god despite the limitations of patriarchal or any other restrictive dogma you see all of you are of the family of man the quantum crystalline activation masters in closing this discourse we leave you with the understanding that all of what we have discussed is around your work in achieving crystalline activation you see it is an essential acquisition for both seekers and the planet it is in fact occurring planetarily through myriad modalities focally through the powerpoints sacred sites and leys of the earth the vortex portals of major power points have crystalline geometric matrixes very similar in nature to the octahedronal and dodecahedronal crystallography of precious gems when higher dimensional light waves are received through these overlay lenses the planet is imbued with platonic crystalline frequency man through intent and impeccability achieves the crystalline vibration what is impeccability impeccability is simply walking ones talk living in integrity eliminating fear and worry always doing your best honoring others and last but certainly not least achieving self love granted this is easier said than none but it is essential in activating your crystalline field can mankind achieve activation of the crystalline qualities without visiting sacred sites yes absolutely but those of you that choose to do so will be within infinity points amidst a crystalline field that is already there and in so doing the process is greatly facilitated you see crystallization is not just an atomic molecular order in physical science and chemistry it is also a vibration achieved through the metamorphosis of crystalline alchemy a vibration occurs that refines an integral clarity that redefines the human electromagnetic energy field into the pristine sacred geometry of the merkabah and merkivah when you accept to activate your crystalline field you acknowledge define and empower your divinity of self you then carry the most precious of sacred sites with you everywhere you go the human heart within crystalline activation ones heart emits a golden spiraled frequency from within the merkabic star tetrahedron and this frequency sings the symphonic song of ascension with the instruments of every sacred site orchestrated to crystalline perfection and it resounds in ecstasy to the cosmos i am metatron and you are beloved

6904090 hello i would like to have some clarity on conscious creation how do i create what i would like to experience im not sure what steps to take can you provide me with some guidance on this thank you
6904091 we invited this little known southern governor to hudson county to our hudson county dinner he lost his voice that night but he was very earnest in his effort and he went on to become our president
6904092 hillarys supporters will recognize her historic run and she will pledge her delegates to barack in a show of unity
6904093 i think the fact that youre seeing her chief fundraisers raise money for him already sends a clear message of unity
6904094 sen obama will deliver a stirring vision for the county
6904095 but the number one issue for people is how am i going to get through these tough times
6904096 barack obama can paint a picture for how he can help people meet the challenge by discussing how he has met challenges in his own life
6904097 you cant do much with 51 votes when 60 are necessary
6904098 we can pick up five seats in the senate at least and whether we can get more will depend in part on how well barack will do
6904099 i dont know enough about the nature of whats going on there to comment on the timing
6904100 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6904101 ive heard that so many times and its never really happened to me before until today it was just a good win for us we fought back the whole game
6904102 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6904103 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6904104 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6904105 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6904106 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6904107 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6904108 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6904109 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6904110 she loves her family thats very important to me and shes a very good humanitarian i just think that shes very balanced since she had her son i think that in all aspects of her life shes been very grateful for the gift that she has and she shares with other people i just think thats great
6904111 my birthday was in june so he booked this trip because he knew celine was going to be here
6904112 she has such a beautiful voice its just so peaceful it seems to be so natural
6904113 when she opened up the olympics in atlanta i believe it was in 1996 thats what the co ordinator said we have the best female singer in the world she is the best no question
6904114 were still hopeful well have ronnie back at some point
6904115 hes got a tear in the upper right side of his leg in the groin area
6904116 its actually a deep hip flexor tear a tear is never good when its a muscle its not a matter of days it is probably a matter of weeks
6904117 he worked on it a little bit in chicago he looked pretty natural over there with alex being out id like to see what teahen can do back at his old position well see how it goes
6904118 im a little nervous an opening day kind of feeling
6904119 along with having a little back problem as far as muscle spasms and things like that his arm has been bothering him too
6904120 but the muscle spasm is whats keeping him out of the lineup
6904121 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
6904122 one of the most important strategic thinkers of our time
6904123 it was rothbard who put all these pieces together into a unified system that seems implausible at first but inevitable once it has been defined and defended
6904124 usually we see increasing buying activity as we go up and increasing selling activity as we go down
6904125 we are working diligently to build up our inventory and hope to resume sales shortly
6904126 will be made in the bond market not in the equity market
6904127 the day the bond investors get reluctant to buy is the day the treasury departments hand will be forced
6904128 their median age is about 20 years younger than our median age
6904129 so i dont think we can party as hard as they are now but 20 years ago we could
6904130 if there was violence erupting the first way in which we would try to evacuate our civilians is by the normal commercial airline route if however that airport a nadi was closed then we would have to consider whether a military evacuation by air or by sea was necessary

6904142 we intend to push forward to gaza in the face of any illeg advertisement itimate or belligerent demands to stop
6904143 we believe we have a moral and a legal right to go to gaza
6904144 if we are stopped or seized we intend to pursue legal action against israel for violating our rights
6904145 the israelis have cannon machine guns warships helicopters and jets all we have are hearing aids and biodegradable balloons for palestinian children
6904146 we have both dealt with the israelis before they can be a bit rough but they wont kill us
6904147 but gaza is so much worse its a big open air prison thats under siege were going to try to give hope to the gazan people the israelis claim the occupation is over but thats utter lies
6904148 these boats should be loaded with diplomats from around the world wanting to pursue the rights they supposedly represent
6904149 israel cant say we no longer occupy gaza but at the same time control its borders
6904150 your offer also slights our human rights mission which is to break the siege of gaza where israel collectively punishes 1 5 million palestinians
6904151 the government of canada is serious about keeping our northern communities safe which is why we are focusing our crime prevention efforts on those who are most at risk

6904153 we are pleased with this latest significant public safety investment by the government of canada
6904154 this latest funding will compliment the ongoing work and accomplishments achieved to date in yukon
6904155 its a long convoy there must be more than 40 vehicles
6904156 it was not clear one could say with any certainty that a substantial withdrawal was taking place
6904157 a set of causes probably came together to cause the accident
6904158 seventy six civilians most of them women and children were martyred today in a coalition forces operation in herat province
6904159 insurgents engaged the soldiers from multiple points within the compound using small arms and rpg rocket propelled grenade fire
6904160 the joint forces responded with small arms fire and an air strike killing 30 militants
6904161 around 2am people were attending a holy koran recitation when americans started bombing tens of civilians were killed
6904162 more than 30 people have been killed i cannot say how many of them are civilians
6904163 twenty five taleban were killed including sidiq and one other commander
6904164 despite controversy ranging from tax evasion to the dissol advertisement ution of parliaments in swaziland and kuwait
6904165 while we have tracked the fortunes of a few high profile royals like the queen of england and sultan of brunei for years this is only the second time we have published a definitive list of the richest royals
6904166 monarchs of such countries as spain and japan failed to make the cut
6904167 so here is my thoughts on something that many women regularly engage in and that i think is
6904168 i am not saying you cant go check your standings if you two are just chilling out on the couch channel surfing i am saying that if youre out of the house and your pulling up the internet on your cell phone or abandoning your honeymoon to check your stats it may be you that has the problem not your lady
6904169 i dont know if i wanna stay alive its so expensive its cheap to die
6904170 what if it was real fire i am not standing in line
6904171 imitation is the highest form of pissing me off quit stealing my content and violating my copyright
6904172 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we are pleased that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house
6904173 however in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington
6904174 we make a judgment about whats in the best financial interest of the city and thats what the council did today
6904175 i think that our management acted quickly and dealt with the situation i hope that settling this eliminates the distraction
6904176 dear lady i would love to walk with you on a beach somewhere for just five minutes how strange to have come so far and to want so little
6904177 the job now is to turn this around and make it into something positive

6904182 darrell will concentrate on what he will do best mentor coaching and getting umpires up to a higher level
6904183 the pakistan cricket board needs to learn a lesson from the indian board
6904184 see how they backed their players in australia recently on contentious issues
6904185 its easy to say look if id known how to deal with that sort of issue the communication and management issues then if i knew then what i know now i may have done things differently
6904186 but i dont believe so because theres a certain limit to what the umpire needs to do under those circumstances and i believe that both the umpires fulfilled those obligations both with the ball tampering and the refusal to play

6904194 it was originally material not intended for public viewing and we took formal procedures to restrict browsing due to fears that it could affect the relationship of trust with foreign countries as well as investigations and public trials
6904195 its a response thats completely out of touch with the right to know and freedom of expression and i cant accept it
6904196 im leaning more towards obama and thats because of both oprahs support and what ive seen of him
6904197 creators are those who make something new rulers are those who maintain order and separation
6904198 so in a way the creators greatest gift to his creation is the gift of structure not a structure which locks the world let alone the creator himself into eternal mechanical repetition but a structure which provides freedom and those who are made in his image will also be both creators and rulers
6904199 the last time andrew fintoff batted like that with me was at edgbaston against australia in 2005 we gave him a new role at number five the man is a superstar i am fortunate to have a bloke like that who i can throw the ball to say knock over the stumps
6904200 we asked a lot of the players but we wont be resting on our laurels the team were brilliant we started off well and built a good foundation
6904201 and this is the stage where steve harmison belongs he should be playing in front of 30 000 40 000 50 000
6904202 we know they can hit the ball but if we get our execution right we should never be going for 98 in the last 10 there is a feeling in the dressing room we can do a lot better
6904203 we pride ourselves on being better than that but england deserved their win they played with a lot more skill
6904204 cricket south africa should have waited until the icc boards teleconference on sunday
6904205 its a decision in haste and we are totally disappointed with it
6904206 after extensive discussions and frank exchange of views the board resolved not to send our team at this time to pakistan to participate in the icc champions trophy
6904207 we respect the right of the pakistan cricket board to stage the tournament and we would urge the icc to reschedule the tournament as soon as possible
6904208 this was a difficult decision but it was the right one there is nothing more important than the safety of our national team
6904209 i think it all depends on pakistan and what they have to say on the security issue
6904210 if pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule they have our support

6904215 we do believe they are related entry was similar in all the cases and the things taken out of the vehicles were very similar
6904216 if the driver of the chrysler had not exited improperly then there may have been a different result today
6904217 oh did they think we wouldnt grow up did they think we couldnt throw back up the sour milk theyve been pouring down our throats
6904218 i saw ten dead dogs on the side of the road driving late last night to your apartment and i thought it was an omen so i headed on back home and walked in circles round my room alone
6904219 i watched the sky turn from blue to black to red and yellow too before the purple dawn was filling up my room and for a brief moment i heard the whole earth groaning like there was something it needed me to do
6904220 we just decided to move because when somebody invades your privacy you dont really feel at home no more
6904221 i dont want to risk the safety of my three children and myself especially my children its just not worth it said fontenot
6904222 and when i looked over here it was nothing but a foot deep of everything that had been drug out from
6904223 i saw his back was he taller than me he was taller than the cops
6904224 i want safety for the community not just myself but i hate to see anyone get their home broken into
6904225 its a real shame that he was apparently safer defending our country in iraq than he was by going to a bar in college station
6904226 he and his friend were attacked unlawfully with deadly force and they exercised the rights they have under the law to defend themselves and now hes facing a murder charge its a tragedy all the way
6904227 i cant really talk about all that because its about the facts of the case
6904228 this is one of those life events you can never explain
6904229 i make bold to declare that the world will derive no benefit from it
6904230 the motivation is to raise awareness and try and encourage these sites to adopt ssl and do it properly

6904234 even these arguably not rich however live in a different financial universe from that inhabited by ordinary members of the middle class they have lots of disposable income after paying for the essentials and they don t lose sleep over expenses like insurance co pays and tuition bills that can seem daunting to many working american families
6904235 according to estimates prepared by the nonpartisan tax policy center those obama tax increases would fall overwhelmingly
6904236 but one thing s for sure mr obama isn t planning to raise taxes on the middle class by any reasonable definition even that of the bush administration
6904237 yes let me pay more in taxes so that the low income family who already has cable a mobile phone and a wide screen tv can afford simply orange instead of minute maid
6904238 its been a long time even to go out and put the pads on to be on the field to be practicing some guys when they get hurt they can go through summer school or practice or get on the field i havent been on the field having practice since the last game of the season
6904239 its been a long time but i feel like ive gotten prepared mentally im on it mentally its just going to be a good test for my shoulder and getting that game speed back and getting that feel for the new stadium
6904240 i feel mentally prepared im excited to get out there and move around get that game speed so when its time to kick it off first game of the season im ready
6904241 as far as how many reps i get im really not sure i think were just going to go in and start the game off and kind of see how it goes
6904242 well do a lot of special teams evaluation as we start to have to make roster decisions we have to make five cuts after this game so it is still evaluation and evaluating how people handle different roles and how they improve so its still ongoing

6904244 may actually find it safer to send non dmca takedowns on the assumption probably correct that most service providers will treat them exactly the same
6904245 the court just assumed that even if it didnt hit all the criteria it was for all intents and purposes
6904246 looks like rather a huge assumption to make and why woud you make an assumption like that
6904247 lets developers write applications that run in the cloud or use services provided from the cloud or both
6904248 any software that provides developer accessible services for creating applications
6904249 a cloud application can be built on a cloud foundation just as an on premises application is built on an on premises foundation both kinds of applications can access infrastructure and application services provided on premises and in the cloud just as on premises platforms support todays applications cloud platforms provide services for the applications were likely to build tomorrow

6904252 will we find the higgs particle at the lhc that of course is the question and the answer is science is what we do when we dont know what were doing
6904253 the lhc is certainly by far the biggest jump into the unknown
6904254 there are many theories as to what will result from these collisions

6904259 you know im thinking my next book is going to be on javascript
6904260 okay we have this model but programming is a real pain and there are all these other models for processing and consuming and producing xml that have nothing to do with the dom except that its there
6904261 wait youre doing what now you can do this with javascript you can do this on the client side
6904262 xml is not just a language to be describing things in
6904263 our main use and our main driver and our main popularity has been this particular model
6904264 oh it is a real programming language and it all makes sense once you get your head around it
6904265 oh my goodness this thing weighs four pounds theres something there

6904274 they want to drag this out build suspense into it
6904275 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6904276 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6904277 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
6904278 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6904279 the smile the way he walks the hand motions they were all the same
6904280 i think that really was developed after he left hawaii
6904281 he had this intense interest in things other than just hawaii
6904282 he was a little more worldly than your average american high schooler
6904283 i got to hang out with him for about 10 or 15 minutes much to the dismay of the secret service
6904284 he was still the same funny smart kind of humble guy i knew growing up

6904286 we have asked the pentagon to allow a six month timetable for submittal of proposals in this competition
6904287 the reason were asking for that is since the issuance of the draft request for proposal rfp two weeks ago as weve engaged in our discussions with the pentagon and theyre asking for a different kind of airplane than they asked for in the first competition
6904288 if we dont get the sufficient time to prepare that proposal theres really little option for us other than to no bid in this competition
6904289 this is a new competition make no mistake about that the requirements have changed
6904290 the proposal will have the specific timelines in it im not going to get into it now and whether or not a company desires to compete is entirely up to them
6904291 we have taken what the gao has told us what they have recommended for us to do which in the scheme of the overall proposal were relatively minor but important addressed all the concerns that the gao raised

6904311 i think everyone practicing this hard putting such an effort into it wants to become number one in the world i still have 21 spots to go
6904312 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6904313 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6904314 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position

6904324 there was more than one cause an engine was not the cause of the accident
6904325 everything we did with the aircraft was by the rules
6904326 to blame the accident on the situation at the company is an outrage

6904373 el presidente lo que tiene que hacer es trabajar en silencio y dejar trabajar
6904374 pero el presidente s y parece que en el segundo intento de despegue el piloto apura al m ximo las posibilidades que da la pista y se observa que el avi n no coge la altura que en situaciones de normalidad estamos acostumbrados a ver
6904375 tenemos que ponernos en manos de los t cnicos y dejarles trabajar

6904377 hemos estado muy descontentos con la reacci n de la compa a en un primer momento no s lo el gobierno de canarias y los familiares sino que tambi n as lo ha expresado el presidente del gobierno de espa a que en los primeros momentos spanair no estuvo a la altura en el sentido de la informaci n

6904395 they pin their ears back early on and they try to get after the quarterback make big plays and cause turnovers
6904396 simon is one of those big play guys that you need to have on you team
6904397 hes the mvp of the league hes the best player on our team and just having him on the field just brings more attention to him
6904398 when im out there i would hope that our teams a lot more confident that we make big plays and when its nut cutting time they know the balls coming to me and i can make a play for us
6904399 we were physical in the first game against the lions and we were able to chop down some of those guys up front
6904400 they bring this mindset that they think theyre tougher than us so we have to bring that mindset too

6904409 from a community point of view theyre not just getting the standard graphs where you see temperature going up or the global average which doesnt really mean a lot to a lot of people
6904410 theyll be able to find out as a community what the implications of climate change will be on them and how it might increase the flood risk but then we want to see how they can adapt to that and make changes to the river
6904411 we want to make the case for why barack obama is the best candidate for filipino americans and the strongest leader for addressing our issues such as immigration reform affordable healthcare and equity for filipino veterans
6904412 if you can call in to vote for super crew 18 times then you can find a way to go and vote on election day
6904413 the purpose of filipinos for obama is to get the community excited about the senators historic candidacy and give a voice to filipino americans in the political process this is an opportunity for the filipino community to claim its stake at the political table

6904430 i realised that so much of my time was consumed either by getting data or transmitting data to somebody else rather than doing what i was trained to do which is to process high level functions and give patients opinions based on my experience and knowledge
6904431 i think that business savvy physicians understand that the most valuable asset within a practice is their time and efficient scheduling is about minimising the time spent on the task
6904432 for a small practice that might only have one desk person who can only handle one call at a time then you can lose people who are on hold
6904433 when you are working so hard just to get people to call you losing the opportunity to take care of these patients because you havent thought out a good scheduling method is a disaster
6904434 we use sms to inform patients of their appointment timings when it is scheduled for when it has changed or as a reminder if they have not been to the hospital in a long time
6904435 we have the mobile numbers for each patient registered within the hospital a few patients will opt out and say that they prefer not to be disturbed and we take them off the list
6904436 everyone has a mobile at this point of time but we usually send the message to the decision maker for the family
6904437 the sms system is very useful because it is instant and people check it far more than they do with email
6904438 before you schedule somebody they need to be registered within your system part of that is refining the questions necessary to make an appointment if you are doing it by email you can also ask about existing medication allergies all these things can save the office staff time and save the physician time when the patient first comes in

6904472 carta de intenci n con epsur para el futuro desarrollo de yacimientos de petr leo ubicados en la parte norte de la provincia de santa cruz
6904473 nosotros decidimos aplicar esa norma porque entendemos que es un lugar donde se puede debatir problemas importantes de la ciudadan a como hoy es el plan plurianual de obras que qui rase o no va a afectar a la poblaci n en los pr ximos a os
6904474 a puertas cerradas y a espaldas de los gremios estatales
6904475 no es as porque la ley es clara en cuanto a la conformaci n y que los representantes de los trabajadores deben ser llamados para integrarlo
6904476 ellos dicen que se llam a los representantes de los gremios y no de los trabajadores pero si bien entiendo que cualquier ciudadano puede tener derecho en participar de algo somos una provincia de m s de 160 mil habitantes y aunque seguramente todos quieren participar de esto si queremos tener un consejo con todos lo m s probable es que no nos entendamos
6904477 ate esta adherido al cta y yo he hablado con los representantes del sindicato estatal y les dije que ellos pueden elevar una propuesta por afuera del consejo econ mico
6904478 algo que desde el gremio no dicen y es muy importante es que cada uno de los componentes del consejo econ mico y social tiene que emitir una opini n entonces si yo me hago nexo para que un proyecto de ellos lo tratemos en el consejo eso se va a tener que discutir y se va a tener que emitir opini n
6904479 aunque no todo el mundo puede estar de acuerdo con lo que piensa la gente de ate ellos lo que quieren es participar ser escuchados votar y que salga como ellos quieren y eso es dif cil
6904480 el consejo econ mico y social no impone nada sino que nicamente emite opini n
6904481 todav a no hay fecha para que se discuta el decreto 931 en su seno
6904482 ni siquiera se sabe si se va a discutir y esto es lo que esta mujer por acu a no entiende
6904483 a nosotros nos parece absolutamente necesario organizar la administraci n p blica y para eso estamos totalmente dispuestos a participar en paritarias
6904484 posiblemente alguna vez se trate este tema o cualquier otro proyecto que tienda a organizar el estado y seguramente ser n llamados los gremios del estatales para participar en la discusi n
6904485 la gobernadora tiene un mandato que le dio el pueblo y puede establecer un mont n de cosas por decreto pero prioriz el di logo que nunca puede ser peor que algo que se imponga cualquiera sea el resultado
6904486 as que qu necesidad tendr a el gobierno de pedir opiniones sobre algo que puede imponer que no sea el deseo de consensuar con la ciudadan a las pol ticas a llevar adelante
6904487 ellos entienden que porque pueden venir con 40 personas a la casa de gobierno a tocar el bombo se los tiene que convocar a tratar cualquier tema
6904488 la idea es comenzar a trabajar en la propuesta de jornada ampliada en las escuelas primarias as como avanzar en la concreci n de los concursos de ascenso en el nivel inicial
6904489 en otras propuestas en la que se busque mejorar la calidad educativa que se les imparte a los chicos en toda la provincia

6904542 i think met officials who approved these quotas are not thinking in terms of the best conservation measures for the keystone species in the kunene region but are succumbing to pressure from conservancies to earn quick bucks
6904543 the government should stop issuing problem animal and trophy permits from sept 2006 to sept 2007 12 large bulls have been shot in the kunene region as problem animals these are not bulls that have been positively identified as problems but permits issued to merely placate pressure on the met from surrounding communities this off take added to the trophy hunts could have catastrophic affects on the desert elephant population
6904544 eradicating the bulls could lead to a social breakdown and a massive loss of knowledge this knowledge is needed to alleviate the pressure on resources
6904545 misuse of resources will only lead to more conflict with humans more pressure on government and more elephants being shot this domino effect can head them to extinction faster than we can ever believe

6904549 he kept accelerating down the street and then hit our garbage cans and flew through the intersection and then popped into the house
6904550 brad is a big strong player that has shown improvement in his three seasons in our organization we asked him to change from defense to forward and he has accepted the challenge and is making the most of it
6904551 weve added four people and every one of them has won a stanley cup
6904552 they have such a great interest i have never seen an nhl organization like this so involved i think it is beneficial for the nhl bound players and for everyone in the locker room
6904553 stockton should attract players because of their skill and the organization and the fan support that we have is the reason we should be one of the top notch teams every season
6904554 i scored the championship goal but we did it as a team
6904555 from the angle i was at casey pushed hernandez in the back you cant do that in this sport jason feels the hands on his back and bends over and it ends up a free header
6904556 i got thrown out with canada once i dont get angry very often but i struggled with that one
6904557 christian is an extremely competitive person and weve liked his development as a player
6904558 he got injured late in the regular season and showed a great deal of heart by playing through the playoffs we expect him to continue to get better and be a big contributor for this organization
6904559 while wearing 22 was called for 22 minor penalties leading the team in penalty minutes without being called for a major
6904560 i had four weeks back home lounging on the couch and enjoying home cooking
6904561 he has tremendous upside we see him as a potential islander hes a big winger 6 foot 3 215 pounds he was our no 1 targeted free agent on the forward end
6904562 it has been pretty tough for awhile i have been in tampa awhile and it is my home i didnt see this coming whatsoever it was a shock for awhile but once i processed the whole thing i got a lot of information from a lot of different places when it came time to decide on waiving my no trade clause we took a quick peek at a few times san jose obviously being the top team i wanted to go to i have played with players on that team i have played with thornton i have played with marleau i have played with nabokov i know blake from the olympics the team along with the management i heard nothing but great things after what happened to me that is very important to me once i kind of got over the shock it was a very easy decision to make
6904563 i am the type of player i have had to prove myself my whole career i am going to do that until the day i retire this is just another chapter in my book i am actually pumped to prove what i can do i want to win and this team is a couple of pieces away from winning
6904564 it is no secret what my style of game is i play on offensive type of game coming in from the blueline i think campbell did a good job at the end of the year helping the team out i watch every team i have the hockey package at home the sharks play an offensive type game which is right up my alley that doesnt neccessarily say you give up on your side of the blueline but i am looking forward to playing with some of the players up there it has been a tough couple of years in tampa unfortunately i have won a cup i have seen what it is like to be at the top of the mountain i have seen what it is like to be the worst in the league last year is one i completely want to forget i heard people talking about me and my year last year it was a horrible year last year and i completely want to forget about it now that i have gotten over the shock of it i am so excited to look forward i am not the youngest guy but i have so much left to give that i am very excited
6904565 i honestly dont have the nicest things to say about what happened in tampa bay i dont want to dwell on this and for this to be what is talked about in san jose but i was misled it was really not the right way to do a lot of things i actually dont have anything good to say about how this all went down once i got over the shock all of a sudden i am on the trading block and finding out a lot of things now i am past that i am ready to move on i have to be honest with you i am a straight shooter i am very excited to be on a team that will not just contend next year but hopefully for the next hopefully 6 years for me and beyond maybe who knows that is what excites me about next season i want to win i have done it before once you get there there is nothing like it
6904566 blake is one of those guys who was probably underappreciated in his career i love guys like that i think he is a great defenseman but he probably does not get as much credit as he deserves thornton everybody talks about how good he is but he hasnt won he is going to win he is a great player and one of the smartest in the game patrick marleau i have played with him and he is one of the best players in the game evgeni nabokov i began my career with him in lexington kentucky in the minors obviously he has come a long way and he is one of the best goalies in the game today not to single out any of the other guys i still have to get to know some of these younger guys they have some of the best prospects in the game 2 3 year guys who are doing an amazing job that makes my job easier and makes me look better too
6904567 i have played with all kinds of defenseman i have played with rookies i have played with veterans it really does not affect me one way or another i am going to play my game bringing in brad lukowich who was my partner the year we one a cup and for 2 3 years in a row i like to think that within a few minutes we will get some kind of chemistry going
6904568 i have not had a chance to speak with coach todd mclellan yet i have talked with doug wilson and he gave me a brief schpiel on him he is from my hometown of ottawa he is one of the most respected coaches in the game and he comes from a winning tradition i have played for all kinds of coaches and i am going to play hard no matter who is behind the bench i am going to give you everything i have and at the end of the day that is what you get
6904569 in tampa i have had the opportunity to play in different situations i got an opportunity to find out what kind of player i could be i love to hit and block shots i am not a fancy player but i like to get out there and play an old school kind of game i think the west is a little more rough and tough so i think that is good for me
6904570 i have been on a lot of stanley cup runs right to the very end and been successful i have seen teams that have not even made it to the playoffs like us last year i think being in different situations being on different teams gives you more awareness with what it takes to win fortunately for me it has been very easy for me to see what it takes to win if i can bring some of those things into the dressing room with the sharks a team that will do anything for each other and sacrifice for each other bring leadership and a little bit of knowledge if can bring a little of that to san jose and help them get over that bubble help them wit what they were looking for that would be a great start for me on the ice i like to be one of the more physical guys on the ice i like to block shots defense first and if i can do anything on offense it will be a bonus for me last year was a very difficult season for everybody and i want to look past it i am very unhappy with the way everything went last year with myself and i am looking to redeem myself and to get to san jose
6904571 i was asked that question about four or five years ago about what fans can expect from dan boyle i said he was one of the most underrated players in the league and that he played for team canada and was definitely going to be an allstar he has proven me right in every respect he is a nice guy he is one of my closest friends he is a game changer in every which way he is not afraid to mix it up either for a little guy he does everything else he is a guy you look for to play those big minutes he can play 30 minutes a night he is a very competitive guy to be honest with you the deciding factor for me going back to tampa was the fact that dan was there i would get a chance to play with him back in tampa and i am very fortunate to get that chance now
6904572 i like to get in on pucks like i said i am not a very flashy guy i like to hit it is part of the game that i have embraced over the years i like to get the puck any chance i can i like penalty killing if i can basically make life easier for my goaltender and my teammates that is me i am not the flashiest guy but i really know the game i am not the biggest guy but i like to make the big hits and give my best every night
6904573 a lot of things are connected under this system obviously it is rare when a player like dan boyle becomes available an elite player in the league he has won a stanley cup and brad lukowich is the same way so when you start building your team and you go back and look at the pieces we have added i think they are pretty consistent we have addressed that when you move people and take on the type of dollars we took on you have to do some other things one you have to move some talent and two you have to replenish some picks we will never alter our draft and develop philosophy when you get the opportunity to add these types of players you have to step up and do it
6904574 i did have one conversation with dan boyle you would have to talk to him about that we had the ability to share some thoughts on our organization he knows our organization very well he has played with a lot of our players we think it is a great compliment that he had an option of choices where he wanted to go and i think he fancies where we are at and what we are trying to accomplish two big right shot players like this boyle and rob blake with rob blake and then with brad coming in it changed our defense evolved it and made it better that was our goal
6904575 absolutely i feel better about this team now we have people who have been there and won it that is really important to have the opportunity to get this type of player we had to do what we did
6904576 dan boyle is a player we have always identified as a great player especially under these rules we think he is the type of guy that we need dont underestimate the impact of a player like brad lukowich also
6904577 with the right hand shots and rob blake is that type of player the minutes and the types of player we added we added three defenseman we had three go out that were on our roster the level that dan is at that rob is at and brad it all makes sense when you look at it from a team building concept we certainly included todd mclellan in these conversations with how we are going to play the puck possession and pushing the puck a little quicker in the big picture this clarifies it for you
6904578 you look at your group and you learn from all of your experiences we made a very aggressive move to add a player at the deadline and he played very well for us we did not quite show enough in the playoffs as i have said we played 5 good games out of 13 you have to maintain the push we had 108 points i cant question many of the things we did but we are going to have to push to get where we want to get to these guys have all been there starting with our coach and these players i think it is an important element one that was needed at this point and we were willing to do it certainly in dans case he will be our power play quarterback for a long time and you cant find those guys that fit into that role we expect him to do it for a long time as he comes into his prime now
6904579 as recently as three or four days ago i was told he was going to be a centrepiece for the organization i was in contact with them through the course of the summer and there was never any indications i wasnt going to be part of this
6904580 under the cap system difficult decisions have to be made and this is one of them craig is a true professional and we would like to thank him for everything that he has done here
6904581 dan is one of the elite offensive minded defensemen in the league today being able to acquire an elite player in his prime that has won a stanley cup will help this organization get to where we want to go
6904582 brad is a tough competitor that isnt afraid to give up his body for the sake of the team
6904583 rob is a tremendous competitor that has been one of the top defensemen in this league for many years while he has enjoyed mentoring the young guys great players need the ability to win in order to thrive and his sole purpose here is to focus on winning
6904584 robs skill set and intangibles speak for themselves i coached nicklas lidstrom for the last three years and rob is the same age as him rob like nicklas has proven to be a leader on a championship winning team and any coach would be lucky to have a player of his caliber
6904585 as i stand here right now i want to be in tampa
6904586 weve been in communication everybody understands everybodys position dan is going to think about things tonight we will have further discussions friday to find what is the best option for dan
6904587 thats one thing weve lacked our power play has been really subpar the last three or four years and we needed to upgrade that campbell can log a lot of minutes and is similar to duncan keith with his feet probably a little more offensive minded than dunc but those two guys can play a lot of minutes
6904588 saying that chicago is back thats not the issue the issue is that we wanted to send a message that we are committed to doing whatever it takes to get better and become a championship team
6904589 san jose is first class in what they did i think it was a case for me that i wanted to be a little closer to my home area chicago just kept creeping back into the picture the whole time
6904590 obviously san jose is first class and they have really good people that work for that organization so a part of me feels bad and a little guilty i consider myself a pretty honest person and to leave people like that is very tough though i was only there for a short time its unfortunate that it didnt work out there but i dont think i would have considered them if i hadnt gone there im happy i did go there but yeah todays a huge celebration for me and for everybody involved with me
6904591 i had my doubts about how much these players actually add to the production process beyond a familiar face for the cover that was until i sat in a room with the 2k games eggheads and nash who got a grilling that makes a postgame media scrum seem like a hugfest by comparison
6904592 they wanted to know what he thought of the series what he wanted to get across and what it was that he thought should change
6904593 well they did have nashs phoenix goal playing on the wall in a continuous loop but i havent heard anything official on that
6904594 from the first day that jody arrived here he brought toughness and character he is one of the most respected players in our room because of his team first attitude and his willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done
6904595 what have you to do with us son of god have you come here to torment us before the time
6904596 have you come here to torture us before the appointed time
6904597 then he commanded his disciples that they should tell no one that he was jesus the christ
6904598 and so does the douay rheims the green and the youngs literal
6904599 of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne
6904600 i will set up they seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom
6904601 but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ
6904602 the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son
6904603 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad
6904604 in that day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel
6904605 and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god
6904606 in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ
6904607 the first man is out of earth made of dust the second is man out of heaven
6904608 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven
6904609 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is of heaven
6904610 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the second adam was made a quickening spirit
6904611 that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto everlasting life by jesus christ our lord
6904612 we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is
6904613 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ
6904614 from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus
6904615 and to enlighten all about the fellowship of the mystery which has been hidden from the ages in the god who all things created by jesus christ
6904616 and enlighten about the stewardship of the mystery which has been hidden from the ages in the god who created all things
6904617 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ
6904618 and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which
6904619 and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery which for ages past was kept hidden in god who created all things
6904620 and to enlighten all men that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in god who created all things
6904621 and to cause all to see what is the fellowship of the secret that hath been hid from the ages in god who the all things did create by jesus christ
6904622 now men are naturally in the dark about these things and the ministry of the word is the means of enlightening them and is indeed the grand design of it and the ministers of the gospel do instrumentally enlighten persons though it is god only that does it efficiently and for this gifts of grace were bestowed upon the apostle even for the enlightening of all men not every individual person in the world but some of all sorts
6904623 the holy angels who look into the mystery of our redemption by christ could not but take notice of this branch of that mystery that among the gentiles is preached the unsearchable riches of christ
6904624 oti en auto ektisthe ta panta en tois ouranois kai epi tes ges ta orata kai ta aorata eite thronoi eite kuriothtes eite archai eite exousiai ta panta di autou kai eis auton ektistai

6904626 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
6904627 for by him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things were created by him and for him
6904628 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming
6904629 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
6904630 rendering vengeance to them that know not god and to them that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus
6904631 jesus christ the son of god but in the westcott hort
6904632 who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
6904633 who can bear gently with the ignorant and erring for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity
6904634 he can deal gently with the ignorant and misguided since he
6904635 he is able to deal gently with the ignorant and wayward since he himself is subject to weakness
6904636 he is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray since he himself is subject to weakness
6904637 who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err because he himself also is compassed with infirmity
6904638 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin
6904639 escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens
6904640 something i dont have cant possible burn in a place that doesnt exist for a nonsensical period of time
6904641 spero non ci scioglieremo ancora sarebbe un po stupido non trovate
6904642 se potessi tornare indietro non credo avremmo dovuto essere cos netti sarebbe bastato decomprimerci per un po prenderci il tempo di cui avevamo bisogno
6904643 tutti volevamo ardentemente che questo succedesse e tutto questo andr avanti non vogliamo buttare via tutto unaltra volta
6904644 i nostri discografici sono rimasti attoniti e stato davvero divertente
6904645 ma tutti loro adesso sono convinti della cosa anche pi di noi
6904646 abbiamo finito lalbum qualche tempo fa e abbiamo pensato perch aspettare sei mesi per farlo uscire
6904647 sembra proprio che dopo in rainbows non ci siano pi regole predefinite circa questo tipo di cose
6904648 hi mariana or derek my name is i found you online and have been reading what you write on your site when can you come list my house
6904649 tenho escrito muitas poesias recentemente me ajuda a pensar e a trabalhar com as coisas
6904650 neste momento sinto que nada que tenha escrito pudessse ter um foco sinto como se precisasse continuar escrevendo at que o escrito comece a tomar forma
6904651 there is no one who uses english language more beguilingly than russell no one smoothes the kinks and creases more artfully out of the most crumpled weaves of thought
6904652 the real reason that we cant have the ten commandments in a courthouse you cannot post thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery and thou shalt not lie in a building full of lawyers judges and politicians it creates a hostile work environment
6904653 the real reason that we cant have the ten commandments in a courthouse you cannot post thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery and thou shalt not lie in a building full of lawyers judges and politicians it creates a hostile work environment
6904654 if youre part of the team when we launch you deserve to be in the credits no question about it that in my estimation is what the credits are for
6904655 everyone who is currently at mythic whos worked on warhammer is going to be in the credits and thats good enough for me
6904656 the actual people who do the menial tasks and long hard hours deserve their credit
6904657 online games are ever changing and have ever changing credits
6904658 if we set that precedent right now that anyone who worked on the game at any point in time is going to be in the credits the credits will be 20 pages long within a couple of years and nobody does that
6904659 i think all inclusive credits do a bit of a disservice as well to the people who are still part of the team who are still working on the game
6904660 ill worry more about the people who are with me right now then those who decided that they didnt like the company or they wanted to take a better job somewhere else
6904661 how come we dont have the five star credit section for people who worked on it for three years then the four star credit section and then the two star credit there are so many issues with it and we want to keep it really simple
6904662 if you really think that were doing something wrong at least have the balls to stand up and go hi my name is so and so

6904668 i want to take the metro to work every day there are two levels what this is so freaking cool
6904669 maam it may not be a good idea to hide around the corner and sit on that ancient chair looking like a mannequin because i almost peed my pants just now thank you for that
6904670 one of our leaders returned from evacuation and saw all this and became indignant he wanted to know who gave me the authority to turn the church into a distribution center
6904671 are you crazy we had the highest crime rate the worst schools and the poorest neighborhoods we had drugs everywhere and the most corrupt politics in the nation you want that back
6904672 joe dont you think the time of the association is over do you believe there is a future for the association
6904673 my friend there will always be an association of baptist churches because the association is nothing in the world except your church and the church down the street and that one across town it is not the little brick building out on the highway or the director of missions who works there hes not the association
6904674 now what the churches in an area do together is up to them you will always have an association of churches because its the churches
6904675 and dont you think the southern baptist convention has had it i mean the day of denominationalism is over isnt it
6904676 bob did you hear what you said to the church tonight you told how your church in florida is working with the international mission board to bring the gospel to that southern american unreached people group well my friend the imb is the southern baptist convention
6904677 we along the gulf coast have been the target of millions of dollars from the north american mission board as baptists from churches all across america have poured into our towns and cities to help us recover from the worst hurricane ever the namb is the southern baptist convention bob
6904678 the southern baptist convention is not a building in nashville and its not even a week in june its your church and the church across town and churches in the next state just like them its all of us serving christ and working together
6904679 he had better command among the three he played with consistency and weve played well as a unit
6904680 the perception will be wrong if that is the perception
6904681 he was very upbeat and positive in our meeting today
6904682 naturally j t started out 7 of 8 or whatever did a nice job
6904683 outside of that like i said id like to do everything the right way
6904684 hopefully its not any more serious than this game right now im led to believe it wont be
6904685 you know what i cant answer that for sure right now
6904686 this decisions going to be based on who we feel at this point gives us the best chance to win thats what well do but the other things
6904687 but on the short term when youre just taking it one game at a time during the season no but in the long haul you do
6904688 when the time comes ill deal with it its sitting is part of the game too
6904689 im really just trying to worry about the preparation for the game this week its a short week were kind of crunched for time and were just trying to get ready for chicago
6904690 id say its a short week and were staying consistent with our plan
6904691 its not serious enough to keep him out of anything further
6904692 ill be curious to see what it looks like because ill certainly have some opinions on what it is
6904693 sometimes an offensive lineman its very restrictive if you cant use that hand very much i believe ive been led to believe that what will be on there will be functional
6904694 as soon as i do ill offer it now i dont
6904695 i feel good about what were doing from a repetition standpoint
6904696 theres still a lot of time left to make that assessment nothing to report on that
6904697 we want to make a good decision and we will
6904698 they kind of talked about us going into that third preseason game and letting us battle it out until then
6904699 he showed a lot of maturity thats difficult for some guys when theyre not playing in the game but he did a nice job im proud of him
6904700 twenty one teams passed on me and when my time comes to play im going to show those teams they made a mistake
6904701 and if we play the 49ers at their place im going to make sure the entire city of chico comes down there to watch us beat them
6904702 its an opportunity to show what you can do you can get the mental reps from sitting back there and not wasting a chance to learn from watching someone else do it but i dont think theres any argument for actually getting in there and getting the game reps practice reps of actually making the throws and making the decisions
6904703 he was at the draft with us the first couple of years alex was with the 49ers anywhere alex would go david would go with him the super bowl everything
6904704 i asked him if he wanted to come up for saturdays game he was going to come up
6904705 im going to apply a little pressure to the practice how well we practice will determine whether we practice in the afternoon
6904706 theres not much communication between the two the campaign wants to see the text but its been slow in coming they dont want headlines about a clinton snub to obama
6904707 you could argue that nobody is qualified to be president
6904708 bill clinton does not think barack obama will be a great president and he doesnt want to say so but hes a pro hell give an endorsement he also likes doing things last minute and he likes to just go out there and say whats on his mind
6904709 he will bash bush and remind people that they were better off when democrats last ran the white house
6904710 the process of clapping during events such as plays operas and orchestral performances when the climax of the moment or the moment most appropriate for ovation has not yet been reached
6904711 rather than directly voting for the president and vice president u s citizens cast votes for electoral college representatives known as electors while electors are theoretically free to vote for the candidate of their choice in practice they pledge to vote for specific candidates ha ha have you heard of anything funnier in a democracy
6904712 since we were growing up in an undemocratic country my father decided that he would teach us about democracy by instating it in our family
6904713 from then on we called my fathers democracy the one legged democracy a democracy where the little people got to decide on matters of little consequence but got ignored on the really important issues
6904714 there is quite some concern in the community particularly young people about mobile phone premium services
6904715 at times the lack of proper disclosure of terms and conditions may mislead consumers in breach of the trade practices act
6904716 who have been confused or misled by certain marketing techniques
6904717 there is an industry scheme in place regulating the provision of mobile premium services
6904718 active steps are being taken to review this and the government encourages industry to continue this work
6904719 wir m chten kein t terwissen bekannt geben solange der m rder frei heruml uft

6904726 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
6904727 they are natural hockey players with strong hockey sense they do a lot of things well and the upside is their bodies are going to get stronger and they re built well physically
6904728 they have some synergy playing with one another and its their puck skills and ability to make plays in tight spaces that stand out most their lack of strength isnt an issue because they have the height and its easier to put on weight than it is to add inches they are tall and skinny but will bulk up when they go to sioux city and northeastern and get into the weight room their development path of going to the ushl and then playing for northeastern is absolutely a great development path for them
6904729 they compliment each other really well and both are very creative players with great hockey sense they are both excited about being drafted by the sharks and so are their parents they both realize how unique this all is the twins are fun to be around and they like to push each other and challenge each other on everything they are very competitive if they could someday theyll probably live in the same house or at least buy the house next door
6904730 they need to compete at a higher level of play and they will next year in the ushl that league will challenge them more especially lines one through four where as in prep school they where only challenged by the top two lines they both need to get quicker and that will come with technical work on their skating and through the pace of the ushl they need to learn how to properly give checks roll off checks and improve their agility but they are both smart enough that they will figure it out quickly they will only be taking a few community college classes and this will be their first year of focusing soley on total hockey their weight is coming and part of them going to the ushl for a year is so they can add that physical stature to play in the ncaa they both have the tremendous work ethics and brilliant hockey minds to get it done
6904731 hes a good skater and a very tough kid hes an excellent playmaker and goal scorer with a tremendous shot
6904732 he has the combination of hands speed and offensive ability he has a long stride and the ability to take the puck in the defensive zone and quickly turn up ice with it he cycles the puck very well and showed good hands in tight and ability to play through traffic when he has the puck he really can control the play and the pace
6904733 his puck skills are exeptional he has the great stick and great hockey sense to create plays in traffic what separates him from his brother drew is the assertiveness he displays on the ice
6904734 hes more cerebral he likes to go east to west stall and delay to make plays justin has the vision skill and i think the courage to make it in the nhl what separates him from his brother is his creativity
6904735 a solid all around player who is more of a playmaker he has a quick shot and showed good poise with the puck hes a solid player who is a few notches below his brother in terms of offensive talent but he does own a quick shot he needs to get stronger on his skates and is only average playing in traffic
6904736 we had everyone in seeing the twins at different times of the year it wasn t so much trying to get both of them together but the other one was still there and we figured it was good value so we took them both we think that they ve been growing the last few years and getting a lot stronger and they re skilled players
6904737 not a whole lot separates drew from justin especially not four rounds of separation worth they are very similar packages but its that assertiveness that drew lacks compared to justin a lot of that probably has do to with the positions they play justin is a center and is naturally more involved with the game while drew could let the game come to him more on the wing
6904738 hes more physical and thats probably why is on the wing drew gets very underestimated and is a great hockey player in his own right drew has some special attributes himself and is not far off of justin
6904739 hes a real physical and tough kid with a good blend to his game he needs some work to refine what kind of player he s going to be hes got some offense and some physicality but we need to get him focused on a type of role
6904740 a swift skater with massive size making him a very interesting project
6904741 ive only seen him three times this year but he does nothing for me he has good size at 6 foot 2 215 pounds but he still needs to fill out and get stronger not very involved enough for me in his own end not an offensive player or real puck mover when i scouted him three years ago for the ohl draft since he is a late 89 i thought he was a very raw player who had some tools but i think he has less upside now than i did then i just dont see him translating because he really doesnt have any pro calibre strengths
6904742 we had him at training camp last year and he played really well but we would have had to commit to a three year deal at the time he went back to juniors and we had people watch him and it was a consensus that this was a player we had to try and draft we got to a point in the draft where we didn t want to risk it and we new a lot about him from training camp
6904743 i liked him as a late pick and at the least he will be running the worcester sharks power play in the near future hes an exceptional passer and while hes not overly big he improved his defensive play this year
6904744 it was kind of a surprise because he was rated really high and we really liked him at the world junior tourney we saw him during the year also and we didn t think he was going to be there so we had to do some things to get another pick
6904745 hes a smallish butterfly goaltender that relies on his quickness and athleticism to make up for his lack of size
6904746 hes a very good shutdown defensemen and is conscientious at his game we feal his offense is starting to come around he has an edge to him when he plays and he s not a crazy player but he makes you pay
6904747 hes skinny and skates funny but he has some smarts and i know of at least one other nhl team that was hot for him at the draft
6904748 astute two way player and a strong shot blocker that can take it the other way for a breakaway forechecks hard will finish his checks but can also use his long reach to clog the outlet lanes will back check and overall works hard without the puck has a nose for the net but lacks a good shot his shot lacks both accuracy and velocity but he can be effective thanks to his instincts around the net scores his goals by battling right on the goalmouth has the awareness to stay there for rebounds instead of skating by the net as so many young players do average passer can make a nice give and go work but other than that he lacks in the way of creativity vision
6904749 thats the thing about hockey its really a four year process of development
6904750 its really good for the fans to understand that you have to be patient with these kids
6904751 samuel was often used on both the power play and penalty kill units showing good puck movement from the point and good body position in front of the net to prevent the opposition from gathering rebounds
6904752 the kid worked his whole life to be drafted in the nhl and i didnt see a reason he shouldnt be
6904753 we have some outstanding young goalies in the pipeline and they need to play we are at the point with brian that we worked very hard to get the right guy we were complimented that he wanted to come back and be a part of this team we have the best goalie tandem in the league the leadership he showed in the room how he played bottom line he got it done on the ice i am very impressed that brian wanted to come back and continue this
6904754 joe pavelski did have a strong year last year hes won national championship and came from a program where he did all things when he was there he played on both ends of the rink he is a big time player we think he is right on track i am not going to limit my expectations of him i think he can be a heck of a player he wants the puck on his stick he wants to be on the ice when the game is on the line he certainly gained respect in that dressing room as the year went on for him to step up and get this deal done for us at this time that tells you a lot about joe he is also getting married so he had some other stuff to handle i am glad he stepped up right now
6904755 our discussions with brian campbell are ongoing i wanted to share that with everybody and that is how we will proceed
6904756 jeremy and i have talked about his coming back a year ago lets see how this works out and i cant give him enough credit what he did last year it is one thing for a guy to say i want to play and it is another thing to put the work in and get to the fitness level he got to but he went and did it you could see he was excited about playing the game at that level and he was committed to wanting to win we talked shortly after the year was over after the trainers and the medical guys sat him down and we said it is going to have to be the same guidelines you are going to have to play hard you are going to have to do the things you did this year not only what he did on the ice but he took some younger guys under his wing and had a huge impact on them
6904757 joe pavelskis contract is a deal that works for everybody i think that is where the deal fell he knows under this cba you can not be overly creative with options and bonuses he knows he has another level to his game and so do we we think it is a fair deal at this point for both parties we got it done pretty quickly
6904758 the two of them had a great relationship nabokov and boucher i think they have great respect for each other and obviously he went 3 1 1 with us i think his save percentage is over 930 so he got it done on the ice that is how you really command respect from your teammates he and nabber worked really well together i dont think you will see nabber playing the same number of games as he did last year when you have to guys like this it enables the goal of being healhty and rested come playoff time when you have two guys like this knock on wood that should take place
6904759 we are looking at everything free agents obviously we can not comment on other teams because they are other teams property until july 1st we are looking to take care of our own business but yeah we have mapped out all sorts of options with players that could be available we are prepared we also look at potential trades there are many ways to acquire players draft trade free agency we have explored all routes in the past and we will do so moving forward a lot of those discussions take place when you have all the gms together in the same building at the draft it escalates some of those conversations
6904760 i dont think we have to free up any money by trading patrick marleau i dont know where that perception is coming from we have always positioned ourselves to have the pieces we want players we have we are trying to keep and add to that yes there are a lot of teams calling and asking about a lot of our players and we take it as a great compliment you should be worried when they dont call and they dont like our players we leave it at that i take every phone call that comes from every gm you learn from what they ask about having said that we think we have a pretty good hockey team with the players we have with the experience they have over the last few years with the new coach with that some of these players will have to re earn their equity we may adjust how we play a little bit patrick marleau i am not sure why he gets asked about more than any of our other guys because i get calls from other gms about 10 12 of our players
6904761 we have sent out qualifying offers for the rfas you talked about clowe ehrhoff goc do we have ongoing negotiations yes are we making progress yes we are i am getting very close in talks with two of the three free agents curtis brown patrick rissmiller and jody shelley i am getting very close with jody shelley jody obviously brings a certain element when you are playing in this division and in this conference he played well and certainly fufilled his physical role you have a tough team but he also showed that he was capable of playing in situations that impressed a lot of people we are close on shelley and i will talk to the other two in the next few days i got back really yesterday i am scheduled to have more conversations and we will have more decisions before july 1st
6904762 last week todd mclellan contacted me we had a great conversation he told me what to expect a litte bit more offensively defense still has to be there he talked more about the team and how bad we are going to want to win what are we going to do to win are we going to be ready and compete every day he has those expectations he didnt really say we are going to be playing here with that you dont really expect a coach to come out and say that because it is a game of hockey and there are so many reads over the course of a season anything can happen so we are going to train hard over summer come into camp in good shape ready to go and pretty much the whole team is going to have that attitude coming back in
6904763 i think last year was interesting i think it goes all the way back to the previous year i got off to a pretty good start and then kind of hit a wall had a little injury didnt finish the way i wanted to finish i think any hockey player wants to finish with his best at the end of the year going into last summer that was a big thing for me to get stronger and be able to last the whole season that is important i came in started off kind of slow it was around 8 10 minutes of ice time a night for awhile towards the end of the season the last 20 25 games i started playing on a bit of a roll and was able to produce more point wise play a little more but i think the whole team kind of stepped it up at the end of the year too guys are feeding off each other i am satisfied how i kind of came around at the end of the year and i think it is a good stepping stone for next year
6904764 it is important this summer to continue to grow with my skating ability protecting the puck and a lot of that comes from just getting stronger as you get older you learn a lot more how you can pick your spots on the ice strength is a big one for me that will kind of lead into every aspect of my game
6904765 i took a lot from jeremy roenick last year he was really good with me and he was really good with a lot of young guys he showed us the way and told us how it used to be back in his days and how it has got to be in todays game he showed us those things i think guys felt comfortable around him he challenged us but he was honest too we took that in stride and we got better as the year went on having him around because he was retired a year ago he came to the sharks organization knowing he would have a chance to win a stanley cup the expectations are right there we have a few changes but the same core group of guys will be back he sees that and it is exciting to be around he brought the energy and i think he will expect that from us and we will expect that from him and more
6904766 i really have not talked about expectations of playing time with anybody obviously coming back i hope to play a little more than the combined backups did last year that is a lot of games for nabby to play i think is a matter of what the coaching staff wants to do
6904767 i think before july 1st i am not able to speak to any other team my only other place i was looking was potentially europe mainly russia that was the only other area i was looking at at the end of the day i think san jose was probably the best place for me family wise that is why i ended up here and there was a great experience last year that is one of the reasons i want to go back there there were a lot of great people and i wanted to be a part of that again with the team we have i think we have a great chance to win every goaltender wants to be on a winning team and hopefully we can do that next year
6904768 for me personally going down to philadelphia ahl last year i played 42 games up until the trade deadline i think it was good for me to be able to get my game back i had not been able to play a lot the last couple of years and i think maybe as an athlete it is not other people second guess you it was second guessing myself you want to rely on past experiences but you need to play by playing last year in the minors i was able to get my confidence back i think i was well prepared coming to san jose to do a good job things went pretty well in my starts the team we had too it is not really hard to play behind those guys it was really enjoyable playing behind them getting my game back in order and stepping into a good situation it made for a good fit hopefully we can continue that next season
6904769 any goaltender would love to play more i think nabby would like to play all 82 who knows the fact of the matter was that i was very fortunate to be back in the national hockey league and have an opportunity with a great team beggars cant be chosers you earn your playing time i dont expect anyone to hand anything to me if i have to work to get more games than hopefully thats what i can do i would like to play more than once every 20 games we will see how it plays out with the new coaches and new people to impress hopefully i can do a job for them and give nabby the amount of rest needed to keep him sharp all day long
6904770 in sports the fans are the ones who drive the values but you dont see them in the media we want to enable talented knowledgeable fans to report on their teams as professional media
6904771 american idol demonstrated there are some talented people in this country youtube let us distribute videos and myspace gave us a place to connect with others but mainly around music there is nothing like this for sports fan media network does this for sports
6904772 the movement of citizen journalism is intriguing and i am curious as a judge and as a member of the media to see what kind of talent is out there for sports fans who think they can report on their favorite teams
6904773 fan media network is taking a professional and organized approach to helping fans produce video reports at ktvu we get a lot of feedback from our viewers on their perspective as fans and this gives them a chance at sports reporting
6904774 you map out where you want to be at certain stages of your career i feel right now i am ready to make the jump i am as full of assistant coaching experience as you can get in this league but timing is perfect with a class organization like this
6904775 i like the fact that there is a strong foundation here there are some other positions that are open right now in the league that maybe dont have a joe thornton or a patrick marleau down the middle or a nabokov in goal i think that is a real strong foundation i do believe players are extremely hungry here right now i think it is my job to give them some guidance and leadership to get them over the hump i beleive we will have a very captive audience i look forward to being a part of that i expect them to respond to that and have some responsibility in that success as well
6904776 naturally that puck possession theme or theory is going to come out but i think that is kind of a fallacy i would like to see a strong puck pursuit game i would like to see us have a strong puck recovery game if you look at what the detroit red wings did they have that label but they gave up the puack as much as any other team in the league but they were prepared to go get it again and to compete for it we are going to be fast i would like to encorporate the defense more into the offense a little bit more get them active obviously 216 goals last year was not good enough so the offense has to come up a little bit more but that isnt done without being responsible on the other side of the ice everybody will be held accountable for their actions players will learn what they receive
6904777 you obviously like to have the puck there is no doubt about it whenever you have the puck you are on offense i am a big believer in that but there are times and situations in a game where you just cant continue you have to give it up but if you give it up with a plan if you give it up to a certain spot where you know you can go and get it again where work is efficient as opposed to giving it up period now you waste a lot of time effort and energy defending i guess that is the best way i can explain a puck pursuit strategy
6904778 i have had a chance to talk with nabby this morning prior to the press conference just to wish him luck at the awards tonight it was a very good conversation nabby and i have one thing in common and that would be our experience in cleveland and our connection to jock callender a very good man there we spent a little time talking about him so its ironic how small the hockey world is and how many connections different people from different worlds have i wished him well and i think he is a person i am very anxious to meet
6904779 that is what excites and challenges me the opportunity to take the team beyond where it is right now it wont be easy there is going to be many ups and downs throughout the year there is going to be frustrations on my behalf frustrations on the players behalf but if we are prepared to be in it for the long haul i really believe you win the stanley cup day one in training camp you dont neccessarily win it when you begin the playoffs you have to build that foundation from day 1 we talking about being a championship team from day one and we will work on it throughout the whole journey
6904780 i dont know if i am mr power play in detroit listrom datsyuk zetterberg they are mr power play in detroit my job is to give them the foundation something that they can work around we did not get in the way of their creativity in detroit we had some principals that we put in place that they are a must i believe on the power play we will implement them here joe thornton patrick marleau pavelski campbell those are tremendous players with a lot of skill sometimes as a coach you can get in their way and hamper what they do out there principles will be very important they will be expected to outwork the penalty kill night in and night out we will see where that takes us
6904781 this will be a busy week for us initially my goal will be to take care of my family make sure my children are taken care of well so i can take care of what needs to be done with the draft coming up with free agency coming up doug and i have not really had an opportunity to get into that at all obviously the remaining staff members have to be put in place the next couple of weeks we will get all of that done and we will be a real unified group when the season starts
6904782 this is a special opportunity there are only 30 of these positions available in the world i feel very fortunate to be involved with one of if not the top organizations in the national hockey league i am very excited about it there are some very good things that have happened here in the san jose sharks organization you dont win close to 50 games a year by accident there is an incredible amount of skill on this hockey team if you combine the skill with the will good things can happen we look forward to doing that
6904783 it is my job as the coach to push this team push them hard push them outside their comfort zone and get them doing things that they may not be comforable doing but while i am doing that make sure they enjoy the process that is the only way championship teams evolve i look forward to that opportunity and can not wait for it to start
6904784 its a very good feeling from the first moment doug wilson called to the moment he offered the job i felt comfortable i think the sharks have done a tremendous job you dont get that close to 50 wins for a number of years in a row without a lot of talent its a matter of getting over the hump there are some real parallels between the wings and the sharks
6904785 its my job as a coach to push this team to push them hard to push them outside their comfort zone and get them to do some things that theyre not comfortable doing butwhile im doing that i will make sure they enjoy the process and thats the only way championship teams evolve
6904786 i had a chance to talk to nabby this morning i called him prior to the press conference to wish him luck at the awards tonight it was a very good conversation nabby and i have one thing in common and that would be our experience in cleveland and our connection to jock callander i wished him well and that s one person i m very anxiously awaiting to meet
6904787 i like the fact that there is a strong foundation here there are some other positions that are open in the league that don t have a patrick marleau or joe thornton down the middle or nabokov in goal i do believe that the players here are extremely hungry right now and i think it s my job to give them some guidance and leadership to get them over the hump
6904788 there is an incredible amount of skill on this hockey team and if you combine the skill with the will a lot of good things can happen
6904789 todd mclellan has an excellent track record and has had success at every level of coaching in his career
6904790 he comes from one of the top organizations in all of sports and has been exposed to some of the brightest hockey minds in the game including jim devallano ken holland scotty bowman steve yzerman and mike babcock along with jacques lemaire to name just a few we feel that todd is an excellent fit for our hockey team
6904791 this is an unbelievable day for me the last couple of weeks have been very exciting obviously when you lose your job in this league you often wonder if you will get another opportunity the furthest thing from my mind at any point in my hockey career ever was to have the opportunity to coach the toronto maple leafs with their incredible history
6904792 i have coached three teams in the national hockey league and kind of start underneath the radar and work our way up i feel i have accomplished those things i belief a team in transition will need a lot of work it is going to require a lot of energy and attention to detail but i am the happiest person in the national hockey league today i am fulfilling a dream kind of completing the circle when i was growing up in fort erie i dreamed about playing for the toronto maple leafs as long as i can remember dave keon was my hero johnny bower another i lived and died with the maple leafs through the 60s eventually i got an opportunity to actually play with the leafs and wear 14 my heros jersey today to come back and be a part of the maple leafs is basically a dream that i never thought i would get to experience we are going to have a lot of work ahead of us this is an interesting project
6904793 i know one of your questions may be why did it take so long well when you have gone throught the roller coaster that i have been through over the last month you want to make sure to take the emotions out of the decision making process and make your decision with your head i think i have been able to do that slow things down and see a clearer picture i have had some interesting meetings obviously with cliff with mr tannenbaum and mr peddie as well i think in talking with my friends around the league they thought i would be a good fit with toronto i decided to make the decision that i would accept their offer once again we are going to have a good time we are going to get to know each other there will be good days more good days than bad days i hope but you guys know i wear my heart on my sleeve occasionally we are going to have some duels but that is the fun part of it
6904794 i think in todays nhl you have to be very patient you see the top teams in the league and i would like to think i come from one of them in san jose every year we were incorporating 3 or 4 rookies into our lineup the job of the head coach in the national hockey league today there is a good part of development involved you dont have the luxury in the salary cap era of putting guys in the minor leagues for 2 or 3 years for seasoning you have to do that along with your staff at the nhl level i am really looking forward to it i understand the cubbard might be a little bare from a younger players stand point right now but that is going to improve in the years to come i look forward to helping and that is the bottom line in this business with winning and the stanley cup i really get pleasure out of helping young players fulfill their potential so i am looking forward to meeting the players that are here now and meeting the players who will be here in the future as well
6904795 to me coming to a team with an interim gm is irrelevant it is putting the pieces of a puzzle together anyone here who has played and who has done puzzles knows there is no exact way to do it you dont have to have x piece first i think this job is to assemble the best possible team in any order at the end of the day the best possible team on and off the ice as well i think that is what management intends to do
6904796 no i am not worried about a new gm wanting a different coach at all i have worked with 4 general managers up to this point i think when cliff did his homework he talked to the 4 guys i worked with and i dont believe i have had a problem with any one of them whoever comes in here as a general manager i am pretty confident i will be able to get along with and i am pretty confident he will be able to see and understand what i can do to help this team as a coach
6904797 no i have no involvement in who the next general manager will be i can go upstairs and bring my contract down and show you no there is nothing at all like that i work for cliff right now and i enjoy that whether it is for 2 weeks or 5 years i get to pick a brilliant hockey mind i plan on doing that i look forward to this challenge
6904798 i cant really say what my expectations are right now i dont really know the team very well my expectations are to put in a defensive system the one guy i know better than anyone else is obviously vesa toskala i really liked him as a goalie we had a situation in san jose where you can only play 1 goalie you cant have 2 great ones so we ended up trading vesa to the leafs it starts in goal and you have a great goaltender i think from watching the leafs you need a little more structure defensively and you need to do a better job killing penalties i guess cliff would look at my track record and see i do have the numbers to back that up defensively special teams i think i can make a difference here
6904799 in todays nhl a turnaround can happen in a hurry the philadelphia flyers finished dead last last season and had a remarkable turnaround i am not saying we are going to be the philadelphia flyers but it does not take as long in the new nhl to turn things around
6904800 i have talked if you know my background one of my mentors is pat quinn before pat got the job here in toronto we had him on board as kind of a mentor in washington for george and i as we went to the finals i have talked with pat about what it is like to coach here i have become friends over the years with paul maurice i have tried to lend paul some support this season when things were going tough in those conversations you have a general feel for what the market is like i have talked to other coaches who know me and they think i can handle the team and the whole atmosphere as well as anybody i might be as qualified as anyone to handle a situation like this i dont really have problems sitting down and talking with people i just expect and open and honest back and forth conversation hopefully we can have that
6904801 maybe i can make a difference on the perceived negative media environment in toronto
6904802 keeping san jose sharks assistant head coach tim hunter is a possibility there is a process san jose is going through an interview process i know tim hunter is viewed favorably by doug wilson and he should be tim has worked with me for 10 years those are things that we will sort out in the next couple of weeks we dont have any games for awhile so my assistants dont really need to be in place hopefully i can get that all cleared away because the program i want to put in place involves a lot of development in the summertime but i do have i am not going to share it with you a plan a and a plan b and probably a little bit of plan c depending on who may be available
6904803 we may have to take a step back in order to go ahead i am just part of the whole process it is hard for me to answer the questions about who is on the farm team who is going to be drafted free agents to be signed that is stuff that is going to transpire over the next couple of weeks i dont care who the players are going to be i wanted and i told doug this when i left san jose is the people i am going to be working with and for right now that is cliff fletcher i could not be working for anyone with a better reputation in this game cliff will do the right thing moving forward and have the right team in place and i am talking about a management team which would include general managers assitant general mangers and include coaches he will have the right team in place
6904804 i am sure cliff will want to hear my ideas on the current roster i can aprise him of my general knowledge of the team as it was last year i dont have much information on the marlies or know any of those players but the players on the leafs i would like to think i am fairly well schooled on who plays well and what the strengths and weaknesses are for a lot of the players one of the things when you are a west coast team and i have been there the last 5 seasons a lot of games are on you watch a lot of hockey we play at 7 30 on the west coast 10 30 your time so i get to watch a lot of hockey games i am not just saying this but i loved listening and watching the leafs a lot because i loved listening to joe bowen calling the game and hockey night in canada with bob cole as a hockey fan they made watching the game exciting maybe to a point where you get fooled thinking as an outsider that the leafs are a lot better i enjoyed watching that and i want to be a part of it i want to make this team better i am not going to say in a few years it will be 1967 all over again but you do forget with pat quinn here the maple leafs came very close to going all the way a bounce here or a bounce there as a coach i have learned you have to put yourself in a position to knock on the door if we can be knocking on the door in two years it would be a tremendous accomplishment then we just have to knock the door down
6904805 i told you i love vesa toskala he has been of my favorite goalies i have ever had i am lucky enough that i have had along the way some pretty great goaltenders olie kolzig won a vezina trophy playing for me in washington i truely believe that evgeni nabokov will win the vezina trophy this year i used to flip a coin as to who would be playing vesa toskala or evgeni nabokov that is the truth they can vouch for that i think when you look at kaberle in particular he is a very coveted defenseman and pavel kubina kubina almost became a san jose shark and if he had i might not be the coach of the toronto maple leafs that might have been one of the missing pieces to the puzzle in san jose a little more veteran presence and leadership on our defense
6904806 do i think mark bell can help that is hard to say mark has gone through a ton in the last couple of years obviously he ran into problems before we ever really got to know him in san jose it made that year difficult that is hard to say that is something we have to sit down with mark bell and see where he is i have coached a lot of guys and mark has paid the price and shown remorse paying his debt to society if you will he has been a true professional at some point i may be able to finish moving from out in san jose be able to sit down with mark and have a long talk with him to see where he is at in his life and his career he has to worry about his life first not mark bell the hockey player
6904807 i can tell you right now i believe the western conference is better the top four teams in the national hockey league are in the west a lot of that has to do with goaltending and defenseman the bigger robust guys on defense are in detroit dallas anaheim and to a lesser extent san jose that is why the power is right now in the western conference the eastern conference for me means better travel more quality practices if you are going to go young you need quality practices if you can get those the eastern conference is so much easier although the schedule will be different moving forward i am still not sure what it is going to be we have to play everybody at least once travel for some eastern teams will go up but it is so much easier to coach in the eastern conference it is ridiculous
6904808 ive had maybe the youngest defense in the league the last three years both in terms of games played and age 18 year old defenseman can play in this league if you surround them with the right veterans who can be mentors its a little easier to develop young people in san jose when you have 1 beat writer and 1 television camera 1 day a month it is more difficult with the media environment you have here
6904809 actually you would be shocked about my relationship with patrick marleau the message patty left me on my phone when i was released has expired on my phone but he thanked me for everything i did for him than helping him grow more as a person than a hockey player and that he would play for me anytime anyplace yes we had a difficult spring last year patrick struggled in the playoffs i might have overreacted i certainly did but we patched that up in a hurry pattys struggles this year had as much to do i think patty worried all year about a carryover i kept reassuring him that nothing was going to happen and doug wilson did the same thing his name was in every internet column i dont know so much that patty read those things but his wife certainly did and it affected his play once the trade deadline went passed patty probably played the best i have ever seen him as a shark in the playoffs a lot of people have told me they have never seen patty compete like that in leaving and i have said this i would love to coach patrick marleau again we have had our differences i have had differences at some point with every player you coach along the way at the end of the day when you close the door you hope everything is ok patty is a great player and he going to continue to improve and become a great leader in san jose
6904810 our cycle down low in san jose was a result of the players you have i think that is what you have to do as a coach i dont have the ron wilson style of play you have to look at your talent and build a system up the ice on your strengths in san jose we had a big physical team up front and a smaller defense that we tried to protect how do you protect a smaller defense you forecheck like madmen and dont let them in your end towards the end when we picked up brian campbell this past year you saw our game completely evolve in 20 games from a dump it in forecheck to more of a puck possession more of a detroit type game you try to do that in a short period of time detroit has been perfecting their game for 15 years we were trying to do it in 2 months and it might have cost us
6904811 this was a country club a retirement home it was a place players came to retire they just forgot to tell us they were doing it john came in and changed the culture changed the way we do business and the attitude and in so doing he raised expectations
6904812 it does not matter how big you are in boxing you are always one punch away
6904813 theres a scarcity of first line centres in the league
6904814 it was all about finding a range once i found that range the left hook was there
6904815 teke is a good fighter but i believe my experience will be the key to victory malik scott is a world class fighter that ill be getting good work with one thing i know for sure im going to leave it all in the ring come fight night
6904816 take longer to understand lessons and divert the teachers energies
6904817 sorry complacency ineptitude low standards and lack of enterprise in the comprehensive system
6904818 is not green enough and were over dependent on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable
6904819 as new projects get delayed and countries from indonesia to egypt curb exports
6904820 just as south korea increases imports 3 5 percent and japan boosts purchases after an earthquake shut down its largest nuclear plant
6904821 obama and mccain are speaking inside saddleback church because they want to bow down to reaction they want to show the bankers and the militarists that they want war that they support big business and that they support the oil companies
6904822 allowing these open primary states to lead off the primary process will be the death of the two party system
6904823 the open status to varying degrees allows people who are not registered members of our parties to participate in our nominating process this makes these non party members more relevant to the process than party activists here in maryland
6904824 if you know beverly byron youre going to do what she says shes been extremely helpful in this campaign and thats one of the other reasons were going to win this election
6904825 we may not have balloons funny hats and millions of dollars pouring into our coffers from corporate sponsors but we have something that is much more important regular folks
6904826 the total number of rookies 15 and their minutes is extremely unlikely to be duplicated again this season just because it was a perfect storm of injuries pretty much throughout the roster

6904836 wayne does too much around the pitch at the expense of what he does up front
6904837 it is a waste of his energy to chase back to our own penalty area for instance
6904838 but it is not something to worry about too much it is purely down to enthusiasm and natural energy he just loves playing football
6904839 he needs to be more involved around the edge of the box but it is only a small correction
6904840 if a player is out for a certain period there is no point rushing it
6904841 you may as well wait the extra week or two to make sure they dont suffer any setbacks

6904857 if we treat all of the lettuce and spinach then theres going to be a very rare instance of exposure to illness causing microorganisms
6904858 whats sad is that the fda after a nearly nine year review selected only two products involved with the massive illnesses in 2006
6904859 i suspect it will take awhile for the supply chain to get into place because of the limited number of irradiation facilities in place in the u s
6904860 these facilities are relatively expensive to build so you have to make sure you have adequate product flow and a market for that product
6904861 it would have to be new construction thats for sure
6904862 we wouldnt expect any immediate adoption and in fact industry wont move forward unless they are sure there wont be a backlash from consumer activists the other issue is that there is a lot more product now being labeled organic and you cannot irradiate products labeled organic
6904863 theres been a lot of research done on that and basically products that have treated with irradiation are as good or better after 14 days typical travel time than those that havent
6904864 we now know that in order to kill e coli on this type of product we can turn down the dosage level the power of the beam effectively and lettuce and spinach remain just as crisp and wholesome as if you grew it yourself
6904865 the american consumer has shown willingness to purchase irradiated products such as strawberries and meats once consumers understand the food safety implications their unfounded worries about the safety of the cold pasteurization process are eliminated even though there are a lot of naysayers and anti irradiation people giving inaccurate information
6904866 the experience with ground beef is that consumers have not reacted negatively to the label
6904867 the only negative reaction is to price it costs more
6904868 in 2006 there were an estimated 50 billion servings of green leafy salads served in this country and there were approximately 1 200 people made ill
6904869 the odds of getting a food borne illness from produce are already extremely low based upon the number of servings that we see but what we have to recognize is that irradiation is one more tool we can use to ensure the safety of our products this is especially important for at risk populations immune compromised folks pregnant women children under the age of eight and elderly these people are at high risk for food borne illness and it may be useful to feed them greens that have been irradiated for that last margin of safety
6904870 the real importance of this rule is that produce companies wouldnt even look at the technology unless the government approved it the new fda rule makes them more inclined to take a fresh look at it

6904876 everything is moving along finally were very excited about coming to pullman
6904877 i think people may be confused the only other store were building near you is a store next to costco in clarkston theres absolutely no truth to rumors that were moving it out of pullman
6904878 we have control on when the store will open and when they get an occupancy permit
6904879 theyre aware that these signals are critical to the operation of the store its not like they could build the store and not the traffic signals thats not an option its directly related to the anticipated effects of walmart its their mitigation for the traffic impacts the store will have its absolutely necessary

6904887 theres a lot of common sense and good judgment were looking for and its not easy to find
6904888 there are probably only 15 or 20 umpires who are good at this at the highest level in the world
6904889 nationality and experience are two key elements all the time
6904890 some players are feistier than others some will test umpires so you dont want to put a fairly new person up there with less experience we put a known quantity up there
6904891 maybe the year before one of them had done a big match on the final weekend and the other didnt and all things being equal well give it to the other
6904892 but not necessarily if someone did a big match last year and we think theyre the right person we dont want to take chances you might have five people who can do it so its a tough decision to make we just kind of have to talk it through and see what we come up with
6904893 to be considered for a tour event some people progress faster than others
6904894 some people get it right away and some people never get it whatever it is
6904895 i started in my local club i was only 13 when i got interested in officiating
6904896 there was a very local tournament with local players some better than others there were no linesman so i was straight on the chair i had a very basic training
6904897 to become a top chair umpire you need to do a lot of matches
6904898 what makes a good official is the experience to have worked many matches to have gone through many situations and to be able to use that experience to handle new ones there is no recipe for it its like when you play the piano not everyone can be mozart
6904899 in 83 i did the final between lendl and connors ive done a lot of connors mcenroe matches
6904900 the player knows this is a professional official he is recognized and this particular official has done several or a lot of matches of that particular player there is a good professional relationship there if there is trust it will be a lot easier for a chair umpire to sell the call when it needs to be accepted if you dont have a trusted official up there to sell the decision it will not be smooth
6904901 our best matches are the ones when people dont remember the umpire
6904902 and when its time for you to step up and show some presence youre ready to do that in a calm and proper way without drawing too much attention to yourself but handling the situation and managing the match and getting play going so the fans can enjoy good tennis

6904917 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh
6904918 have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh

6904921 the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society
6904922 it wont affect you so why should you care is the common refrain while it may be true that allowing single sex unions will not immediately and directly affect all existing marriages the real question is how it will affect society as a whole
6904923 we call upon responsible citizens and officers of government everywhere to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society
6904924 we accept that we effected the most awful wounds on a huge number of people

6904931 this is where technical achievement crashes head on with creativity
6904932 its thrilling to see the flash community push the boundaries technically creatively and geographically with spectacular results
6904933 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6904934 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6904935 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6904936 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6904937 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6904938 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6904939 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6904940 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot

6904955 desde finales del a o pasado fuimos conscientes de que los ciudadanos podr an tener necesidad de ayudas para pagar comida agua o luz en 2008 por eso pensamos que los 300 000 que presupuestaba el pp cada a o para estas ayudas no eran suficientes y por eso decidimos triplicarlas hasta los 900 000 actuales

6904968 no one has the right to demand a nonemergency medical procedure from someone who finds that procedure morally unacceptable or religiously objectionable
6904969 this case did not involve a life and death situation but only a possible inconvenience one which required the patient to walk across the office
6904970 to even suggest that a physicians religious and moral conscience must yield to the directives of a patient regarding a nonemergency procedure is so clearly contrary to traditional notions of individual liberty and religious freedom that there should have been no question that the court would defer to the constitutional rights of the involved doctors
6904971 sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition
6904972 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
6904973 thus under the united states supreme courts most recent holdings a religious objector has no federal constitutional right to an exemption from a neutral and valid law of general applicability on the ground that compliance with that law is contrary to the objectors religious beliefs

6904980 its not often i have the opportunity to congratulate a cutting edge tech company on such splendiferous retrofuck jackholery
6904981 hopefully the champions league will take me onto the next stage
6904982 to win a competition like that is a great achievement for any player
6904983 we are all in the game to win trophies i am no different
6904984 when i have finished i will look back and see how many trophies i have won and judge myself then
6904985 we have a lot of young players in the team and it can only help us
6904986 hopefully we can take that into the next few years and make us a better team
6904987 i am an unselfish player i have said that many times
6904988 by the time we get to liverpool and chelsea well be in a far better position player wise and hopefully form wise too
6904989 but mondays a big one for us we get that one out of the road get a result there and its a positive step forward given the players who are all coming back
6904990 when you stop playing it is difficult to come back again
6904991 you need rhythm even more when you are a striker because you need confidence if you dont have confidence you are nothing
6904992 we know we can improve but we have players in the olympic games and players returning late
6904993 maybe the game wasnt the best but we can improve clearly
6904994 we hope fernando can create his piece of club history and then maybe more in the future
6904995 everyones aware of the quality that martin has hes a great outlet for us on the left hand side
6904996 most of our attacking threat has come through martin so we need to keep him fit and well and keep getting him into the right areas so that he has a ready supply of ball to work with
6904997 if we do that he will continue to be a threat for us
6904998 we know the success of our season is based on how quickly we can focus again on club targets after international games
6904999 fulham have a strong squad and their team look more dangerous going forwards than they did last year

6905115 a la plantilla de trabajadores que ordinariamente han venido colmando con diligencia y prestancia la ausencia de buenos gestores y criterios empresariales en la administraci n y gesti n del servicio p blico de transporte
6905116 no podemos comprender c mo guaguas municipales que da servicio al 50 de la poblaci n de la isla haya podido consentir y consiente que la denominada ficha financiera del contrato programa 2004 2007 que subvenciona el transporte p blico en el archipi lago est medida en t rminos de oferta de kil metros anuales cuando lo procedente operando con criterios empresariales hubiese sido establecer dichas aportaciones en funci n de potenciales usuarios y viajeros transportados

6905137 if the media outlets are covering this just because hes black thats the wrong reason
6905138 any time theres a presidential campaign it should be important to african americans and not just because one of the candidates is black
6905139 our mission is to celebrate african american culture and to chronicle african american achievement
6905140 when the year started this was not in our budget but when he became the presumptive nominee it just seemed like this was a sure thing for us
6905141 weve gotten folks who can discuss these issues and whats happening from all sides of the coin
6905142 there will be balance from people who can speak with passion
6905143 i really take offense to the charge that black journalists cant be objective there is the celebratory nature of the moment thats true
6905144 but were going to call the candidates on their agendas we cant give either of them a free pass we do have to keep in mind our demographic which is the 18 to 34 year old viewer and be responsive to that but that will not taint the integrity of the journalism that goes into it
6905145 the black press will provide a perspective and viewpoint you wont get from other press
6905146 just by definition covering the republican national convention doesnt fit into our mission and our viewers would not expect it
6905147 theres no need for us to bring a presence to an event if theres no african americans involved
6905148 there hasnt been the type of investment in collecting news about the state of black america that would balance and complement the news that comes from more mainstream outlets and given the role the rnc has played in the problems of this country i would think those networks would want to be there
6905149 during the debate season i would look at my ratings for those nights and they were lower while cnns and msnbcs were higher

6905203 up until the last two years energy prices affected agriculture primarily by influencing production costs particularly fertilizer and diesel prices but now that we have linked energy and commodity markets both production costs and crop demand are influenced by energy prices

6905205 no private company would put up with its employees refusing to show up for work let alone watch the problem grow year after year
6905206 despite repeated statements from bush administration officials about increasing transparency and improving the accuracy of reported data in federal small business contracting programs the new policy is seen as another major step backwards in accuracy and transparency it will now be even more difficult for federal officials the public and watchdog groups to monitor the ccr database and uncover large businesses trying to masquerade as small businesses to illegally receive government small business contracts
6905207 the change simply eliminates the need to disclose the information about the local offices of a company
6905208 the company is still required to disclose its total annual revenue and number of employees which is information sba uses to make size determinations
6905209 the government should turn its attention to making data more reliable rather than removing any transparency related to a contractors size
6905210 you can fault the contractors here but in a lot of these reports the emphasis is on the government for not verifying data
6905211 fusion centers did not get built and did not get instituted because federal officials decided they wanted to
6905212 states did it because they saw the need to get a mechanism for information sharing up and running so they could communicate within regions now federal agencies are working carefully with state and local governments to gradually build up these fusion centers to the point where they represent an almost complete but not fully instituted national network for sharing information relating to terrorism and other crimes
6905213 through the benefit of technology we can do it better in a more secure manner and with much greater protection of civil liberty and privacy than the old system which was largely ad hoc
6905214 the information is only going to flow to those who are supposed to get that information and it will be protected and kept private from everybody else

6905261 menurut saya itu pernyataan yang tidak patut alangkah baiknya fadel muhammad dipanggil dan dibicarakan secara baik baik kenapa kemudian harus mengatakan untuk mempersilakan fadel untuk pindah partai ini kan makin menunjukan internal golkar sudah tidak solid lagi fadel itu kan kader terbaik
6905262 kalau kemudian juga fadel muhammad mengatakan gagal menjadi calon anggota legislatif karena dekat dengan saya memangnya kenapa memangnya ada apa semua di dpp golkar sebagian juga dekat dengan saya yang saya lihat ada yang tidak menginginkan fadel maju karena dianggap sebagai pesaing
6905263 sama sekali pernyataan itu tidaklah tepat sama sekali seharusnya kita bisa mengoreksi dan tidak benar seorang pemimpin kemudian dinilai anak buahnya bermasalah kemudian mengeluarkan pernyataan seperti itu meski saya menyatakan akan tetap loyal tapi saya memang kecewa dengan oknum oknum di dpp
6905264 ini kan sudah menjelang pemilu partai golkar membutuhkan suatu soliditas organisasi konsolidasi partai kita butuhkan seharunya dpp mengambil langkah langkah yang seharusnya memperkuat organisasi dan jangan sampai mengambil langkah langkah yang mengarah kepada organisasi tidak semakin solid seperti yang dilakukan terhadap fadel muhammad ini kan mengganggu soliditas organiasasi
6905265 jauh lebih baik ketua umum jusuf kalla bersama para pengurus golkar lain memanggil fadel kemudian menjelaskan mengapa tidak dicalonkan itu kan jauh lebih baik saya juga dengar pak jusuf kalla mengatakan begini kalau fadel merasa tidak puas mau keluar partai silakan itu kan pernyataan yang tidak patut makin menegaskan sudah tidak ada soliditas partai lagi
6905266 sudah seminggu ini penjualan kurma mulai ramai biasanya pasar akan semakin ramai hingga menjelang lebaran

6905268 yang membeli kurma memang cukup lumayan karena makan kurma bagian dari sunah rasul jadi biarpun harganya mahal yang beli tetap ada
6905269 konsumen yang belanja banyak yang kaget kok harganya naik tinggi saya juga heran padahal untuk pasokan kurma tidak ada masalah
6905270 saya diperintahkan beli 10 kg kurma madu yaman untuk persiapan buka puasa di kantor nanti

6905277 there is increasing awareness that military families especially the children can be significantly affected when a parent is deployed and there is even greater psychological wear and tear when there are multiple deployments
6905278 the spouse left behind is suddenly thrust into the role of being a single parent routines are interrupted the children may not understand where their mom or dad has gone and the service member on the front lines is constantly worried about how their family is doing back home
6905279 its a three pronged approach to restore a psychological balance to the family promote future resiliency and increase knowledge and understanding among the military family culture
6905280 if there are five family members theres a good chance that there are five different stories of what that most recent deployment experience was like
6905281 family members often dont want to burden each other with their personal problems but in these exceptional circumstances of long term separations building a shared family narrative can be very helpful in reestablishing a close family identity and building its strength
6905282 and probably a bit of the big toes thats what worries me the big one is for balance id have to learn to walk again
6905283 i have no fever and i also have no nightmares so actually im doing fine
6905284 awful really awful painful and smells everything but hes still alive and thats the main thing
6905285 i hardly survived a big stone smashed my face and my arm people see me with a bloody face and they are shocked they think this is not just a walk in the mountains this guy is crazy then i start to explain that if you are ambitious there is a lot of risk
6905286 i had this drive to prove to all the people around me that i could do k2 that i can climb everest without oxygen that i can go to the north pole that i can survive for 80 days on the south pole
6905287 a lot of people didnt believe me maybe because of this i had this stubborn thing i will show you
6905288 but she didnt know anything about peaks it sounded romantic and there was media attention but then when it went wrong she was very scared and said i hope you never do this again
6905289 its a milestone you can say your whole life i was there when you talk about it you get this i dont know how you say it in english this shivering
6905290 and you are fighting for each other taking care of each other to survive this it gives you a soulmate the rest of your life you can always knock on the door they will always be there to help you
6905291 its always in the media when people are killed but if its a successful story nobodys interested to the summit this time it was all perfect and then all the way down its this big story because of the tragedy
6905292 people do think we are crazy but we also think a lot of people around us are spilling their lives by doing nothing my mother my father they died from cancer my mother was eaten away by this disease and for her the quantity of life was the most important thing she was 63 when she died for me its about quality maybe you dont get old but it doesnt matter to me
6905293 yes of course but you just have to put things in compartments and concentrate on the job in hand
6905294 you think fuck it is not possible because it is getting very stupid
6905295 first he slips then he tumbles over then hes gone its some kind of slow motion you think give me your hands then hes gone aaaah just like that then you realise fuck he must be dead then you see some movements on the glacier and everybody is shouting hes still alive
6905296 i thought nobody knows im here its bad weather no helicopter can get here probably i gave up i thought if i moved id fall there was no solution
6905297 it was just pure focus i was only thinking about surviving i was too busy to pray if i had prayed then it would have meant id really given up
6905298 im not sure if it was tiredness or that i lost consciousness
6905299 no i dont think so because as a mountaineer you know these things can happen

6905302 you see gerard standing there this huge man with a big smile on his face there was not a moment when we were thinking of tragedy everything was according to plan
6905303 one of the sherpas had reached the summit and the next day his wife gave birth and this norwegian couple is still in my mind

6905309 i opted not to do that thinking at first that photosynth might make more sense as a blog post not a column in its own right i was also reluctant to try out this web service or any other companys in a pre release state as recent events have shown a sites scalability and performance issues may not surface when only a selected group of testers can play with it
6905310 anyway after seeing the headlines on the nyt and wsj sites i clicked over to the photosynth site to check it out for myself and discovered as many of you may have that it was out of commission
6905311 what would you have done not knowing ahead of time if the photosynth site would crash or not a reviewed it in its pre release state b held off on that topic to write about deep packet inspection c written about some other subject altogether if you choose c you have to say what the other subject would be the comments are yours

6905317 this is nothing new top russian officials including prime minister and former president putin have been saying precisely this for more than a year now dont they listen dont they realize that bluffing of this type gets you in serious trouble
6905318 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
6905319 now if the abm systems are actually deployed to poland
6905320 the country becomes a legitimate target and under some circumstances they will be hit

6905322 the british misjudged the russians and they said oops and backed off you saw it in the daily telegraph commentaries by their top diplomatic correspondent david blair but so far
6905323 nobody in the u s government has had the sense to acknowledge the mistake
6905324 asked what he might do to retaliate for the abm deployment in central europe he said he would return to the cold war practice of having russian ballistic missiles programmed to strike targets in europe in this case he said the czech and polish anti missile sites as well as new u s bases in bulgaria and romania
6905325 it is obvious that if part of the strategic nuclear potential of the united states is located in europe and according to our military experts will be threatening us we will have to respond what kind of steps are we going to take in response of course we are going to get new targets in europe
6905326 has a longer track record than that he is a legendary entrepreneur
6905327 who would have thought last year that me and t boone pickens would be in the same swift boat pulling the same oar the same way

6905329 by seizing the opportunity to pound georgia with air strikes and military incursions vladimir putin russias prime minister is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed
6905330 allow cultivation of opium for the production of essential medicines such as morphine and codeine
6905331 drug control in georgia drug testing and the reduction of drug use
6905332 the former first secretary of the central committee of the communist party of georgia eduard shevardnadze initiated harsh legal measures and public campaigns against drug users in the 1970s
6905333 announced the possibility of shifting the focus of drug policy away from the predominantly law enforcement orientation
6905334 anatomy of a fallacy senlis council and narcotics in afghanistan
6905335 in the present situation the senlis proposals would on the contrary speed up the transformation of afghanistan into a narco economy which it already is to some extent by legitimizing the position of the current drug lords who have succeeded the warlords in holding power in the country the senlis proposals would moreover fail to address the issue of trafficking
6905336 in terms of my involvement i think it would be of most use in the early stages providing advice and consultancy from behind the scenes in light of my continuing role as chair of the european monitoring group my association with the uk government and some work
6905337 i am being asked to put together a proposal by the undcp united nations drug control program in vienna this fifth column role would allow me to oversee the setting up of the agency i already have good quality individuals in mind with whom i could work in confidence on this while promoting its aims subtly in the formal governmental settings
6905338 based on the experiences of other nations in this fight the international community and the governments of afghanistan the united kingdom and the united states support a mix of deterrence prevention and economic development assistance to suppress existing illicit opium cultivation production and trafficking in afghanistan
6905339 all likely to get worse in the coming 24 months
6905340 a five year road building effort employing afghan contractors and training and mentoring afghan engineers
6905341 the war will be won when we fix the afghan agricultural system which employs 82 of the population
6905342 unless we deal head on with this enormous cancer we should have little expectation that our efforts in afghanistan will not eventually come to ruin
6905343 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6905344 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6905345 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6905346 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6905347 nobody seems to have a well tuned plan to handle them given the threats posed by the financial crisis a better framework for dealing with systemic crises is urgently needed the policies recently instituted by the treasury and the federal reserve to deal with the financial crises seem improvised rather than part of a consistent well articulated policy
6905348 there is still a risk that financial dominoes will begin to fall
6905349 if the bear stearns crisis had such a potential for disaster what will we do if a major hedge fund fails or if several crises happen at once what if the next case is worse
6905350 no one in government seems to feel a responsibility for warning about such possibilities and formulating a detailed policy for dealing with them
6905351 after all the dreaded financial meltdown would amount to a wave of bankruptcies
6905352 so that in times of financial crisis when more is at stake than the fate of individual companies and their stakeholders troubled companies could be kept functioning longer a subsidized system of triage would be needed to identify which companies should be saved with the main criterion being the possible economic impact of their liquidation
6905353 is sending an emphatic message with global consequences the curtain has fallen on the era when nato steadily expanded into eastern europe and onwards to embrace the former republics of the soviet union and russia was able to respond with nothing more than bluster the balance of power in europe has fundamentally changed
6905354 russia has not made one wrong move mr bushs remarks yesterday notwithstanding in five days it turned an overreaching blunder by a western backed opponent into a devastating exposure of western impotence dithering and double standards on respecting national sovereignty there are lessons everywhere to the former soviet republics remember your geography to nato do you still want to incorporate caucasian vendettas into your alliance to tbilisi do you want to keep a president who brought this on you to washington does russias voice still count for nothing like it or not it counts for a lot
6905355 this decision clearly demonstrates everything we have said recently namely that the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation the moment has been chosen well and therefore any fairy tales about deterring other states fairy tales that with the help of this system we will deter some sort of rogue states no longer work
6905356 the order for the ukrainian army to provoke military conflict against the russian black sea fleet
6905357 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6905358 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6905359 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6905360 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6905361 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6905362 worried that we were too far away from hoxton square and no one would walk round the corner
6905363 rail europes website doesnt let you have a non flexible ticket for part of the way and a flexible ticket for the other part
6905364 the web development team was aware not all combinations of tickets would be available if a through fare was selected
6905365 in the interest of offering the simplest booking experience we had to limit the combinations of fare types available online if all combinations were offered the choices would be baffling to customers and the likelihood of them successfully completing a booking would be slim
6905366 the ticket engine whether it is being used by call centre staff ticket office staff or you on the web should be sophisticated enough to give you those options
6905367 the industry needs to develop the software to enable this but it doesnt sound to us like an impossible task
6905368 generally its up to a business to decide how it sets prices
6905369 we would expect costs to be clearly set out and transparent so that consumers can make an informed choice
6905370 in most cases the cheaper non and semi flexible fares would not have been available on eurostar
6905371 that means the fare type for the onward part of the journey whether that be to cologne basel or milan would have to have used a flexible ticket regardless of whether a cheaper non flexible option was available
6905372 it is worth looking online first to see what is available rather than relying on the operator to find the cheapest for you
6905373 sometimes you need to prompt or coerce the agent to rummage around a bit to find the best fare there are all sorts of quirks when you book tickets for european rail travel getting the best deal is an art not a science

6905411 the number of public toilets taxis public transport and even late night food outlets required to support them

6905416 one of the strengths of john heales book is that it is carefully calculated not to be shocking
6905417 it is a welcome relief from the majority of journalistic coverage which seems only interested in angelic victims and evil perpetrators instead of these cliches heale looks for patterns in all the places where street gang activity has become a social problem
6905418 perhaps heales most memorable conclusion is that gangs as we understand them as structured organisations with hierarchies and rules are often an illusion

6905420 tim parks negotiates the contradictions of his self imposed task with notable grace

6905430 that day there were 1 800 people coming to the beach and i realised i was completely wrong
6905431 such a crowd of people in a turtle nesting area was doing a lot of damage i decided everyone had to get out get off the beach
6905432 id be alone on the beach and go out swimming with the turtles and dolphins in summer the beach at gerakas would be black with hatchlings i didnt appreciate it at the time but i was living in gods pocket
6905433 its the turtles that highlight the problems on the island
6905434 their nesting sites are the main tourist beaches and their nesting time is exactly the same as the european holiday season we have to find a way that humans and animals can co exist
6905435 i love the night time beach patrols watching the turtles climb up the beach in the moonlight
6905436 see the tower over there thats the airport they built it on top of our only lake which was a major migration point for thousands of birds including flamingoes
6905437 that is laganas the main tourist town for zakynthos very popular with the british i want to show you laganas
6905438 we dont kill them by driving the boat over them
6905439 until the 1980s laganas with the airport just behind it was a big freshwater ecosystem as well as the main nesting site for loggerhead turtles
6905440 now the sand is packed so hard that no turtle could ever make a nest even if it wanted to all the building here on the beach is illegal it is just a big club for 18 to 30s and with all the drunkenness it has become a very dangerous place
6905441 gerakas has been a success but now i want to extend that success im taking the message to the heart of the problem
6905442 every year there are injured animals and i think they should be treated here and then released back into the bay
6905443 we have had local hostility in the past seven years some of our people were beaten up and the camp has been targeted
6905444 but things are getting better now i reckon our message is getting through
6905445 loggerheads take at least 25 years to reach sexual maturity so we havent yet felt the full effects of the beach development
6905446 apart from pollution problems the tip attracts seagulls the main predator of baby turtles and it is right above dafni beach a major nesting area

6905462 dad im wondering here mum is in the capable hands of staff whose authority she accepts at home shell just try to be the boss
6905463 she ought to come home it feels more natural if she dies there and i want to be around her for a bit i dont want to drive to this depressing hospital every day and leave her alone at night
6905464 we prefer not to receive telephone calls visitors or flowers
6905465 as soon as this medication loses its efficacy i request euthanasia
6905466 it should be your own decision none of us is to say anything
6905467 i think what she finds unbearable is not so much her pain and sickness but the fear of it getting worse and of losing control
6905468 the doctor had to ascertain if i was not being forced into euthanasia
6905469 i was planning to stay with some friends this weekend
6905470 and who has got more priority then your friends or your terminally ill mother
6905471 why dont you stay with your friends next week when im dead youll have all the time in the world then

6905475 can i just ask you something is there still a lot you feel you need to do
6905476 i can always come back later if you are not ready
6905477 i dont know what our government does period i reality is my drug
6905478 i dont know what our government does period i the obama campaign is issuing another of its paten
6905479 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co iowa caucuses
6905480 hombres armados y encapuchados que viajaban en dos camionetas le dispararon con rifles tipo ak 47 y luego huyeron
6905481 cuatro hombres que viajaban en un veh culo en el centro de ciudad ju rez fueron baleados por varios hombres armados con rifles de asalto
6905482 its been a year whatever or whoever killed your man is long gone
6905483 come on now mercy lets get you something to eat
6905484 you are going to eat something you ate no dinner you need to eat
6905485 your mama would blush if she could hear you right now
6905486 if some strange man was about to intrude on her while she was wearing nothing but her bedclothes then she would have done more than swear
6905487 a strange man mercy does that mean since i am no stranger im allowed to intrude on you while youre in a state of undress
6905488 and where is your husband mercy should i fear being challenged to a duel for interrupting your privacy
6905489 very proud that the movie is surviving the nonsense people are getting to see the movie its sort of starting to have a cult life
6905490 you dont have to sh on somebody elses work to advance your own material
6905491 made a f ing great movie and the politics that are being visited upon it have nothing to do with the movie at all this is all about ego and though i mourn the fact that midnight meat train was never given its chance in theaters its a beautifully stylish scary movie and it isnt going anywhere people will find it and whether they find it in midnight shows or they find it on dvd theyll find it and in the end the joe drakes of the world will disappear
6905492 the estranged husband had kidnapped and held his wife for ransom or to force some financial gain she was held in captive for a total of five days and during that time she was beaten and allegedly tased numerous times in order for her to sign over some paperwork
6905493 if anything i see them in the window arguing a lot because they have a window up there the man came out by himself a lot she looked like she was always at home when he wasnt around you know id be walking around and shed be up there in the dishes shed never come out i rarely see her outside
6905494 but ive respected the process from day one and i want to continue to do that today and allow any details about the process and final decisions to be made by senator obama and their campaign not by anybody else
6905495 i am not in that arena this is his decision and i respect him to make it however he thinks is best for him and the country
6905496 i think its a fair assessment that ive done more than anybody else in my position
6905497 i doubt the following story the bumper sticker is just too ugly to be official
6905498 lets all croak up and die for the good of the planet
6905499 senator mccain has the majority of the votes but senator obama has been elected president
6905500 i would not have nominated uhhh clarence thomas uh i dont think that uhhh i i i i i i dont think that he was an exper uh a strong enough jurist or legal thinker uh at the time uh for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6905501 an unruptured aneurysm looks kind of like a balloon an out pouching of an artery
6905502 it almost always occurs at a point where the artery branches off
6905503 but it is usually not like any other headache youve had it is very sudden or severe the worst headache of your life
6905504 they are most common in middle age the 40s and 50s are the peak ages
6905505 ive seen them in teenagers they do occasionally occur in elderly people
6905506 not smoking and treating hypertension prevent aneurysms from growing and rupturing
6905507 if you are in bad shape right in the beginning the odds of recovery are much lower
6905508 how mccain doesnt know what an economic stimulus is how he doesnt understand what a cap and trade system is and about his hysteria based foreign policy
6905509 obamas 46 to 39 statewide advantage is especially aided by a 39 point bulge among voters in wayne county including detroit
6905510 cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
6905511 for mr trump this acquisition was not business related but as he has stated was meant to help out an american icon
6905512 if another buyer should emerge who will create the benefit mr trump sought for ed mcmahon then he is clearly pleased
6905513 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6905514 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6905515 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6905516 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6905517 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6905518 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6905519 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6905520 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6905521 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6905522 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6905523 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6905524 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6905525 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6905526 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6905527 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6905528 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6905529 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6905530 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6905531 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6905532 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6905533 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6905534 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6905535 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6905536 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
6905537 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit
6905538 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
6905539 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
6905540 make the world everyone knows look strange they make the world we know look like a bad dream
6905541 if i ask them why this man or woman is sick the mushroom spirits will tell me
6905542 did not use hallucinogens the way many people use them today they did not use them to get high they did not use them because they thought hallucinogens would give them a good time the ancient people of the world knew how powerful these drugs could be and they used them carefully and for very special reasons
6905543 the faces of the people around him began to look like horrible masks
6905544 he babbled nonsense and shouted half crazily he couldnt control his thoughts and emotions
6905545 people who continue to use lsd begin to need stronger and stronger doses of the drug to get the same effect they did at first they have developed tolerance to the drug
6905546 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6905547 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6905548 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6905549 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6905550 i exercise 4 to 5 times a week and there were parts of me that were exercise resistant so i went and did a little tweaking
6905551 i actually just took 2 days off with a weekend
6905552 i had it done on a wednesday and went back to work on monday
6905553 were able to offer results that are cosmetic enhancements yet maintain your natural appearance
6905554 i think that a lot of people are finding out that plastic surgery is affordable and its being done right in our backyard
6905555 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6905556 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6905557 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6905558 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6905559 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6905560 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6905561 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6905562 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6905563 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6905564 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6905565 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6905566 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6905567 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6905568 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6905569 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6905570 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6905571 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6905572 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6905573 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6905574 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6905575 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6905576 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6905577 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6905578 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6905579 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6905580 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6905581 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6905582 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6905583 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6905584 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6905585 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6905586 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6905587 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6905588 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6905589 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6905590 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6905591 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6905592 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6905593 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6905594 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6905595 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6905596 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6905597 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6905598 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6905599 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6905600 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6905601 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6905602 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6905603 this is a planning took where all things are going
6905604 melihat michael berlatih bersama kami dalam beberapa hari terakhir merupakan sebuah suntikan semangat bagi siapapun
6905605 dia sudah latihan dengan kami selama dua hari terakhir dan saya menaruhnya di bangku cadangan jadi ini adalah langkah yang besar
6905606 dia fit dan bahkan mencetak gol saat latihan michael bukan lelaki yang membutuhkan banyak hal untuk sehat
6905607 ini adalah kali pertama pemain pemain baru seperti coloccini guthrie atau gutierrez akan melihat bagaimana rasanya bermain bersama michael ini melecut semua pemain
6905608 real madrid mengetahui pernyataan pemain tersebut dan sangat menyesalkan isinya
6905609 real madrid tidak pernah menginginkan untuk mempertahankan seorang pemain dengan melawan keinginan pemain tersebut sebagai hasilnya madrid tidak punya alternatif lain kecuali menerima keputusan sepihak untuk memutus kontrak bila itu adalah keinginan si pemain

6905614 i dont have any qualms about buying wal mart peanuts
6905615 i dont know if its in my head or not but i tend to buy the nationally renowned brands
6905616 the national brands are more expensive but i guess its like eating at a restaurant you pay more versus eating at home you always pay that much more for the premium brand

6905629 were always evaluating whats happening in the marketplace and certainly something thats happening in the last couple of months is that sonys managed to sell some boxes
6905630 so whether or not you like developing for that platform if theyve got millions of people connected to that platform and buying their games you have to take it seriously
6905631 theyre in the race now so weve got to re evaluate that for what it is
6905632 theres zero chance of it happening this year its something thats being talked about right now as the game is gaining popularity and looking like its going to be a hit
6905633 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
6905634 well that is our job we dont technically get money for you
6905635 its a mystery to me why u s publishers think people will pay more for less especially when the online world offers so many alternatives
6905636 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force
6905637 has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6905638 they wont act until the coast is clear on financial stability and the state of the economy
6905639 such an approach would appear well justified as our financial system has become less bank centered
6905640 some caution is in order however as this more comprehensive approach would be technically demanding and possibly very costly both for the regulators and the firms they supervise
6905641 a continuing five day battle in the streets and parks of chicago
6905642 yeah but back when you were a drug addict you hit their mother
6905643 im going to write some book and somebodys going to buy it from me and were going to use the advance to fund college
6905644 my two favorite all time books are pride and prejudice and jane eyre
6905645 i took longer to get started on jane eyres daughter which needed a different kind of writing style i replayed some incidents from the original book janets meeting with roderick landless in the lane the mystery of the noises in the night and my book became i felt an echo of the original book
6905646 one reason i took to writing sequels was that i couldnt write modern dialogue
6905647 in east africa i moved in a limited circle of government employees where the english was roughly bbc in america i was defeated by accents and words that were all over the place writing sequels in the english of earlier times was a solution
6905648 jane eyres daughter took me about two years to write
6905649 it was self published in 1999 once again i enjoyed myself hugely
6905650 i started writing to my own great surprise when i was thirty and was living about 10 miles outside nairobi kenya beyond the national park
6905651 at that time i had a baby and a job so you can tell the impulse was strong
6905652 one evening at about ten oclock my husband and i were standing on our verandah giving our dog a last run when an african askari policeman came up our drive and told us that there were two lions at the entrance to the drive
6905653 go inside he said we collared tina our alsatian but still stood outside the house listening and watching
6905654 all at once tinas fur began to rise on her neck and she gave a low growl
6905655 then we heard rustling and crunching from the dead leaves behind the hedge that made a half circle around our house tina turned slowly as the lions moved round the back of the hedge we never saw them but we knew they were there
6905656 a story waiting to be told so i wrote it and eventually sold it to dent
6905657 the last being the worlds only mouse version of pride and prejudice entitled eligibility being an account of the romance between miss elizabeth mouse and mr
6905658 i havent yet found a publisher for this but i feel it would if published find its way into the christmas stocking of every jane austen reader in the country
6905659 a little dignity not too much so that it goes to my head just enough so that i can hold my head up
6905660 like some exotic dish that i dont yet know how to make but yearn for in my dreams
6905661 loneliness nearly as acute as his own they both longed to return to a time before the people they loved most were lost
6905662 lifes a feckin football match if you cant get your ball in the back of the net youre no one
6905663 back and forth back and forth to the notes his mind a saw trying to shriek through a tough bark of words
6905664 i definitely want to get something bad on the road
6905665 big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
6905666 the way well be the zogby report on the transformation of the american dream
6905667 four meta movements that separately and together are redefining the american dream living with limits embracing diversity looking inward and demanding authenticity
6905668 great transition my polling has limned and confirmed time and again going from a nation of excess to one of tangible limits on spending on the exercise of power even on our hopes and imaginings
6905669 collectively we americans might not know exactly what authentic is but for the most part we know what it is not and we know that we want whatever authentic might be
6905670 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion said mike leavitt secretary of the department of health and human services but mr leavitt acknowledged that some medical providers may want to press the definition and make the case that some forms of contraception are tantamount to abortion karen brauer president of pharmacists for life said she expects members of her group will do exactly that it would be pretty excellent she said if states lost federal funding over laws requiring pharmacists to fill birth control prescriptions
6905671 this show was not easy for him he just made it look easy
6905672 he came as a genius and left as a genius all the participants aspired to reach his level

6905674 more knowledgeable more costly more like the labels on the better line skirts
6905675 a man who hadnt lived through a winter in a sod house with hard silent people was unlikely to understand why a girl would run away
6905676 rebels all a short history of the conservative mind in postwar america
6905677 who are committed to the desirability of fostering both a belief in god and a recognition of the merits of our economic system
6905678 this was no populism of pitchfork carrying farmers it was a populism of wealthy men telling those trained into scholarship purported experts but really little more than moral functionaries how to run the ship an anti intellectualism on the march for the upper classes
6905679 the cold war provided a way of seeing the world in apocalyptic terms
6905680 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
6905681 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities

6905690 yes he took ambien last night but spent the last 6 hours sleepwalking driving and eating unfortunately he consumed half of a turkey and now hes paying for it
6905691 heres the story of a lovely lady who was bringing up three very lovely vp names all of this while dressed in gold like this mother the youngest of the press in curls
6905692 heres the story of a man named anderson who was busy with three pundits of his own they were four men living on the press plane but they were all alone

6905696 well about the vp pick i just hope i dont get
6905697 for the last time i dont have any vp information for you the only thing i know is that i need a beer
6905698 monica lewinski that is my v p choice and we shall smoke cigars and rule the world
6905699 what can i say guys i woulda wiped the floor with mccain but now were seeing your golden boys star begin to fall
6905700 guys lets all close our eyes and pray senator obama chooses me for vp
6905701 yes i did get a call but im not telling anyone guess i will be stuck here in new york with bill
6905702 maybe its his brother and theyre waiting for a visa
6905703 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6905704 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6905705 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6905706 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6905707 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6905708 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6905709 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6905710 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6905711 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6905712 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6905713 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6905714 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6905715 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6905716 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6905717 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6905718 whilst any loss of data is regrettable all moj incidents have been reported and the necessary action taken
6905719 to address information risks and inspire public trust and confidence
6905720 freedom can be denied for a while but it cannot be denied forever
6905721 poland has always been a strong defender of freedom even in dark days when it was not able to fully express its desire for freedom
6905722 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6905723 but it is even more important to have friends who share your hopes and aspirations and dreams and poland and the united states are those kinds of friends
6905724 the shield is in fact a sword of the white house and the polish government
6905725 nobody has the right to tell poland what to do times have passed
6905726 they feel that poland is one of their territories and poland is entering their field
6905727 its in polands interest to stay on the american radar to be seen from washington and if we are ever in trouble to hope at least for american support
6905728 we had to do it if only to retain our sovereignty if we had rejected the russians would have interpreted it as a success
6905729 the first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6905730 tons of molten metal was found 21 days after the attack
6905731 steel doesnt begin to melt until 2 700 degrees which is much hotter than what these fires could have caused
6905732 there are holes in this story that you can drive a truck through
6905733 dr steven jones found it in the dust that landed in the entire area of lower manhattan and he finds it in the chunks of previously molten metal from the towers
6905734 nist said that wtc 7 fell at 40 slower than free fall speed but it collapsed a lot faster than it would have if the structural supports were not all blown away at the same instant 40 slower isnt very impressive thats like arguing that a rock falling through concrete 40 slower than a rock falling through the air is perfectly normal
6905735 i wish that there would be a peer review of this
6905736 i think all the records that nist has assembled should be archived i would really like to see someone else take a look at what theyve done both structurally and from a fire point of view i think the official conclusion that nist arrived at is questionable
6905737 photos of the steel evidence about how the buildings collapsed the unexplainable collapse of wtc 7 evidence of thermite in the debris as well as several other red flags are quite troubling indications of well planned and controlled demolition
6905738 why would all 47 stories of wtc 7 fall straight down to the ground in about seven seconds it was not struck by any aircraft or engulfed in any fire an independent investigation is justified for all three collapses including the surviving steel samples and the composition of the dust
6905739 wtc 7 building could not have collapsed as a result of internal fire and external debris no plane hit this building this is the only case of a steel frame building collapsing through fire in the world the fire on this building was small amp localized therefore what is the cause
6905740 i was really happy that we were able to get everybody involved
6905741 i was happy with our possession of the ball and that we were able to finish on the opportunities that we received
6905742 a vulnerability was reported in openssh on red hat enterprise linux
6905743 what i do find annoying is that novell is continuing to feed microsofts fud machine about linux
6905744 how can i recover a bad superblock from a corrupted ext3 partition to get back my data
6905745 to get your weekend started off right here are 9 ways you can hopefully get your terminal output back to normal if
6905746 servers for both red hat enterprise linux and fedora linux were compromised in recent weeks by some kind of illegal access neither traversing red hat enterprise linux 5 on system p
6905747 so youve been the ibm aix guru on your team for years now and your bosses have determined that they want to try linux on fudcon report from the fedora project leader
6905748 this has been an exceptional way to introduce open source customers to the larger ecosystem behind the products they love and the linux product insider rhel 5 2
6905749 as microsoft is set to pump up to 100 million more in novell for linux its important to note that microsoft is not paying off linux microsoft novell monopoly 2 0
6905750 remember when jason matasow asked how can microsoft not be evil the question remains unanswered
6905751 however novell has only invoiced 156 million of microsofts original 240 million certificate purchase leaving 35 of the funds microsoft has serious plans to do away with windows
6905752 the plans which are far from being finalized indicate the microsoft is really running scared of mac os and linux on the desktop
6905753 he punches me first and his friend who had nothing to do with it punches me
6905754 one of the stupidest things i ever did in my life
6905755 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6905756 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6905757 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6905758 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6905759 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6905760 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6905761 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6905762 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6905763 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6905764 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6905765 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6905766 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6905767 in this one womans book i drew a plank then it looked like it would be a sign like youd have in a yard so i wrote abortions 3 she was upset so i changed it to 13
6905768 hemon parlayed his experience into english that manages to be laconic springy and brilliantly off centre it tastes unforgettable like pickles or asparagus
6905769 was not a tax resident of any country and therefore the payment was free of tax
6905770 kanye was still grinding it out when i was grinding it out we did shows together he actually opened for me at one point
6905771 it was weird cause people didnt know him at all he was really well known in the music business because he was producing for everybody but no one kind of in the general public knew who he was as a rapper
6905772 ive already spoken to technical support and or ram guy
6905773 i never really knew that she could dance like this
6905774 at 7 00 am it is what do you want mom
6905775 well i wanted you to be here yesterday to console your father but since that is now an impossibility when can you arrive the soonest
6905776 whats the rush i thought the funeral wasnt till thursday
6905777 im not talking about the funeral im talking about your father
6905778 him and i both were just heartbroken we should be together you know as a family
6905779 lets not forget our manners stacey baby lets not do that

6905782 debkafiles military sources disclose that a powerful russian naval contingent led by the aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov left murmansk on the barents sea aug 18 to dock at the syrian mediterranean port of tartus saturday aug 23 it includes the russian navys biggest missile cruiser moskva and at least four nuclear missile submarines
6905783 there is sorrow on the sea it cannot be quiet 23 damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear hath seized her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travail 24 therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord of hosts
6905784 there will no longer be a situation of distant fighting where major cities continue with life as usual the war will reach the cities and homes of israeli citizens and our enemys objective will be to target the homefront
6905785 we will be forced to bring an end to hostilities quickly at the smallest possible cost using our comparative advantage
6905786 get the expletive out of here you expletive expletive im going to kill you
6905787 changed my fear and loathing into respect and appreciation for this amazing plant
6905788 the bill we hope is the way to rescue some people

6905968 it doesnt go too fast and doesnt get off the ground
6905969 the paddle boats are pretty slow too i like them as well

6906031 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6906032 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6906033 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6906034 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6906035 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6906036 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6906037 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6906038 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6906039 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6906040 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6906041 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6906042 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6906043 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6906044 hes coming to training camp and hes going to try to prove that he can make the team
6906045 he has come in for a couple of workouts hell try to make the team somehow
6906046 obviously it wasnt very nice but i wasnt expecting cheers
6906047 no one ever really wanted to get to know me
6906048 i wasnt happy in there at all i was never myself i think it was because i knew so much from the outside
6906049 for me to be in there as rexs girlfriend was very difficult
6906050 there were also huge numbers of spectators who came out to watch it

6906052 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
6906053 okay the declaration for a local state of emergency has been activated
6906054 it hangs around alabama mississippi were on the east side of the storm and thats where you are going to get all the wind and the water
6906055 before ivan we had six or seven of them ive been here for 23 years weve had numerous storms come through here and a tropical storm hadnt bothered us much we just hope it doesnt get in the gulf and build back up
6906056 we always tighten everything up that can get blown around we do have water that can come up so you have to be careful that nothing going to float off
6906057 j t osullivan will be our starting quarterback going into the season and im expecting him to succeed
6906058 im very confident j t is at the point where hes our best man for the job right now
6906059 this hasnt been a case of alex and shaun not performing well
6906060 this has been a case of j t performing very well thats why we are where we are j t has very good command of the offense hes played well in all three preseason games and now its time for us to get ready for the regular season
6906061 but in a way theyre really kind of right ive had stumbling blocks all along the way this years starting off right everythings starting off good
6906062 this seems like the year theres just something in the air that makes this year feel special
6906063 a lot of times if you really really want to make a play nine times out of 10 youre going to end up making it thats all it is
6906064 i feel like ive been hit with a challenge to be this great linebacker
6906065 i just want to live up to it and rise to the challenge
6906066 theres always a little bit of a pressure but not more than i can handle you just have to perform under pressure thats what the best do the guys that become great perform under pressure
6906067 you can see that focus on the field because hes been more consistent and thats what its going to take to get him to the next level
6906068 this is not a case of shaun or alex not playing well
6906069 this is a case of j t osullivan performing very well
6906070 its always a pleasure to watch a player who has those unique abilities that eric has
6906071 as a scout you fill out the box with power with fielding with the ability to hit ability to throw with eric it was very easy you filled out every box
6906072 were not going to put any artificial timetable on him
6906073 hes going to start at idaho falls and move from there as he meets the challenges of professional baseball hell graduate from level to level
6906074 the thing thats great about eric and speaks to who he is and the type of baseball player eric is and the way he respects the game is the fact hes already been away playing in the summer against great competition
6906075 so he already has had that sense of what professional baseball is all about
6906076 ill just go out wherever these guys send me and just play the game play the game ive been playing since i was a little boy
6906077 im just going to go out wherever they send me and just have fun i dont know how many other guys got picked in the draft but as of now were all in the same spot
6906078 when i go to idaho im an idaho falls chukars just like everyone else
6906079 im going to do whatever i can to help that team win
6906080 the best advice he got was from one of his advisers

6906084 from what they tell me as soon as scott dixon starts the race on sunday he will have 12 points for sure and that will eliminate me from contention
6906085 right now im just working on winning some races for the team
6906086 once you win the championship it isnt real important if you finish second third or fourth
6906087 when im at a racetrack the cameras are rolling and there are many things that become a story because ive been fortunate to have people following me since very early in my indycar career
6906088 its like when you tune into a golf game you want to know how tigers doing
6906089 i just have to be conscious of that i just have to be aware that people are always watching and especially young people are watching
6906090 i think as i mature as a driver i understand a little bit better what i need out of the car and am able to do what i need to do on the track to go fast
6906091 omar is a champion baseball player and hes well respected not only in our country but around the world
6906092 we met back in our hometown and im honored that he wanted to come out to the track and learn more about hvm racing and the indycar series
6906093 being in the pits and watching everything develop was great its more exciting when you watch it so close it seems really demanding and takes a lot of responsibility e j has always taken the challenge well
6906094 he went down there and did a real nice job ill be anxious to watch him pitch tonight
6906095 they said the command of his pitches was much better the location of his pitches was much better
6906096 up here i thought he was too much of a high ball pitcher and paid the price for it
6906097 he went down there and got some good work in and put some good numbers up and had a chance to come up here
6906098 if you are going to start back again you might as well start against a team that has the kind of lineup that the yankees do
6906099 the phone will ring and itll be romo and ill maybe not answer
6906100 hes not losing and using a lot of energy going left and right before he gets going
6906101 i want to spend as little time as possible in these things
6906102 width of the nose and the length of the face
6906103 we are not open about relationship thats why i made so much mistakes in my previous relationship sad no
6906104 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
6906105 our plan is to leave if the water gets up too high
6906106 weve been flooded out before in hurricanes and tropical storms and were not taking any chances ive got the cars moved to higher ground and were ready to go
6906107 my biggest concern here is flooding and people not taking this storm seriously
6906108 were expecting heavy rain and when this river starts to come up if youve waited that long you could get trapped in your house
6906109 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
6906110 when faced with potentially disastrous weather all of us must take the necessary precautions to protect lives and property
6906111 now is the time to update and replenish those family disaster kits to ensure that ample food fresh water prescription medication and other emergency supplies are sufficient for at least 72 hours in case of power outages or flooding
6906112 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
6906113 we only have anderson road which is right there and 150 yards we have ferry and these are the only two ways we can get out of here except to go deeper into the water and were just trapped we are trapped
6906114 getting to draw write star wars or spider man or batman
6906115 thats a nice dog you got hes been keeping us company
6906116 the big change were seeing is increased adoption of the mobile lifestyle among rank and file workers not just the traditional mobile group
6906117 taking a holistic approach creates a lot of process efficiencies
6906118 you want all the applications running on the device to look and feel the same way as they do on a laptop or desktop computer
6906119 one action spawns multiple reactions to improve productivity and efficiency
6906120 you need clear policies in place to support mobile tools and that kind of work
6906121 its more than just cell phones and laptops you need a more comprehensive program to be truly effective
6906122 the watchword is caution because companies and products come in and out of fashion very quickly especially in this
6906123 my friends built a contraption to steal baja blast from taco bell
6906124 this was actually part of a larger complex of buildings on the site and now the pavilion is the only one left there was actually a bandstand that was in front of the building on the west side and then where were sitting now on the terrace the double staircase is left but there was also a promenade that continued south and then had a big amphitheater so this was actually the center of several different venues here in lake park at the turn of the century
6906125 theyre all very expensive you know so i think in many respects that having lake park bistro here brings people into the park that normally wouldnt be here it provides a revenue stream for the preservation of the building
6906126 they would bring food and they could eat in there so what we want to do is to make it really open to the community and to have it more attractive and to let people know because a lot of people dont even know that this is a room for the community
6906127 people were referring to this building as the bistro and we wanted people to know that it wasnt just the bistro that there was public space and so we started calling the room informally the community room and just put up a piece of paper and so from the papers this is now 12 years later we now have a sign that says lake park community room
6906128 as the parks department entered this public private relationship as the upstairs became private it became even more important for the downstairs to be public and now we really need to rethink how this downstairs space is being used and how we might use it better
6906129 acaso una cortes a no llama siempre otra helena graciela cisneros
6906130 i cannot emphasize how important preparedness is during severe weather
6906131 we have a lot of points left in the game
6906132 we know what we need to do i think they have more to lose than us were going to be fighting
6906133 if there is one point between us even if at sometimes it looks impossible and right now its not even going to have the faith were going to continue working
6906134 joking aside the good news is nobody got hurt and things can definitely be replaced
6906135 but when you go back to the truck its hard to forget a lot of our tools that we would be able to use here are gone the good news is team penske is always prepared we already had a truck that came from charlotte stuff that well be able to use now
6906136 you just have to keep focused on what youre trying thats the biggest thing for us making sure that we make as many points as we can at any opportunity at least then you know youve done your best even if somebody takes you out of it
6906137 hes very competitive and penske is a team that has won many races a lot of championships a lot of indy 500s so theyve definitely got the equipment and the drivers to do it
6906138 look at helio hes come second seven times this year so easily he could have won some races hes on top of his game
6906139 the good news is that im very comfortable with the road courses
6906140 the bad news is he is also very comfortable with the road courses
6906141 are you at the intersection of 61 and highway 19
6906142 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on the belief that im the greatest race car driver that ever lived
6906143 know what im saying thats what david pearson told me that if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car deep down you really have to believe in yourself and i think everyone who performs at a high level in every sport does i was watching the olympics and it struck me you see individuals that achieve so well and they achieve such great things and there are all the other folks who dont and just having the guts to go out there and jump in the water and swim or go run 100 meters in front of the whole world and compete you know you have the chance to lose but you just have to do the very best you can thats all you can do
6906144 being absolutely clear when nascar approved the toyota engine they gave them a bunch of considerations from a parameter point of view a dimension point of view that were outside the box in terms of what the ford engine was the pushrods are straighter the camshaft is higher the pushrods are shorter the valve train is stiffer the cooling system works better all of those things were things that nascar uses discretion to approve that obsolete the ford engine and we cant make as much power as they do with the parts we have and right now we cant afford to obsolete all the parts that we have so nascar in the interest of fairness and balance in the competition from a potential point of view after they went to great lengths to be able to check the engines to find out what they were doing decided that they needed to rein toyota in and thats what they did theres crying and complaining about it but the problem was when they submitted the engine toyota had approved things that obsolete really everybody else and now weve all got the necessity to come back and re design and obsolete our current engines in order to get competitive the error wasnt ours for getting behind the error was in what toyota offered and what nascar approved
6906145 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6906146 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6906147 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6906148 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6906149 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws
6906150 for candidates of either party to become the nominee when there is any question of the ability to serve if elected

6906161 alerting healthcare practitioners to reports of life threatening complications associated with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein rhbmp when used in the cervical spine
6906162 life threatening complications associated with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein rhbmp when used in the cervical spine
6906163 difficulty breathing or swallowing or swelling of the neck tongue mouth throat and shoulders or upper chest area and patients need to seek medical attention immediately at the first sign of an airway complication
6906164 the safety and effectiveness of rhbmp in the cervical spine have not been demonstrated and these products are not approved by fda for this use
6906165 we can take that data to the fda now for a cervical spine phase ii trial
6906166 these results provide mesoblast with a major clinical and commercial opportunity in light of the recent notification by the fda
6906167 that practitioners either use approved alternative treatments or consider enrolling as investigators in approved clinical studies
6906168 given the limited treatment options available for patients in need of cervical fusion mesoblast believes that this clinical indication may provide an accelerated path to regulatory market approval of its product
6906169 significantly no cell related adverse events were noted at any time throughout the study
6906170 groups receiving either dose of mesoblasts allogeneic cells had earlier and more robust fusion than the other groups
6906171 in view of the fda notification concerning life threatening complications of rhbmp in cervical fusion we are encouraged that the profile of our allogeneic cells in the cervical space may translate into a safe and effective clinical alternative
6906172 she loves her family thats very important to me and shes a very good humanitarian i just think that shes very balanced since she had her son i think that in all aspects of her life shes been very grateful for the gift that she has and she shares with other people i just think thats great

6906176 for mr trump this acquisition was not business related but as he has stated was meant to help out an american icon

6906178 some of you are young you havent gotten there yet you get a little tight back or you wake up funny or you tweak it or whatever you and then you just have to let it calm down a little bit hes much better today
6906179 we knew we had something special here and it seems many other people think the same thing
6906180 savings needed to fund health insurance and health care expenses in retirement
6906181 because the guidelines are intended to be general individuals who want to replace greater amount of the pr retirement income or have specific goals should consult with a planner who can create a customized strategy finally we hope that by the end of the summer morningstar ibbotson assoc will have developed an online calculator to on their and fpa web site
6906182 metlife has been a very good company for us and has essentially allowed rgas management team to run the company in the way it sees fit
6906183 we downgraded the stock because it had really peaked out
6906184 we thought the stock got a little bit ahead of itself
6906185 i think if you look at the companys past performance and the earnings i dont think its stock is overpriced
6906186 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
6906187 they do not want to buy me out it was a little pity but they can do whatever they want
6906188 so what does that tell you about what this country has become i dont have the answer but i wish someone could explain it to me because im at a total loss at what has happened to our common sense as a nation
6906189 obama meanwhile has done nothing absolutely nothing nothing nothing for the service of this country
6906190 i think we suffered a big blow today to the hard liners
6906191 i dont think hes spoken to senator clinton about the vice presidency or even sought her council
6906192 we may be surprised if he picks her but after that it was pretty clear that not only were they not interested in had having her they were not interested in her opinion
6906193 the dude at the ride took too many tickets from me

6906196 the motivation is to raise awareness and try and encourage these sites to adopt ssl and do it properly

6906205 its the specter of a food fuel and water crisis
6906206 since water consumption goes up where there is development and improved lifestyles we can expect even greater demands on fresh water
6906207 there are serious and extremely worrying factors that indicate that water supplies are close to exhaustion in some countries
6906208 by when the current food crisis may turn into a perpetual crisis
6906209 the crisis stems from a confluence of problems but perhaps no contributing factor is more insidious and correctable than the privatization of the resource
6906210 when peoples access to clean drinking water is all of us pay a premium and because of this many of the worlds poor go thirsty

6906218 at that time antony fortuny still suspected that part of the boys mental deficiencies were due to his diet which was far too influenced by his mothers french cooking it was a well known fact that the richness of buttery foods led to moral ruin and confusion of the intellect
6906219 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6906220 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
6906221 now that the curtain has been pulled back its clear that these fast food franchisers are only looking to line their pockets i think its disturbing that they are spending so much money to attack me

6906234 this seizure underlines the excellent cooperation between all our partners in the region and once again confirms the importance of our presence in the caribbean
6906235 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
6906236 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
6906237 it is a fact that people of this region northern areas are facing more human rights violations and whenever the official media talks of repression in indian kashmir people with strong hearts laugh at this hypocritical attitude and people with weak hearts cry
6906238 india is not perpetrating even one hundredth part of the repression that people spread over an area of 28 000 miles have been facing for the past 50 years the indian government has given people all their fundamental human rights and in spite of that they are in a state of confrontation against the government but the people of this region northern areas are far behind the rest of the world in matters of fundamental human rights justice and economic development

6906242 therefore the only way forward for kashmir is to liberate it physically and return the rule back to islam
6906243 no person or political party in azad jammu and kashmir shall be permitted to propagate against or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to the ideology of the states accession to pakistan
6906244 defames or brings into ridicule the judiciary of ajk of pakistan or the armed forces of pakistan
6906245 that i will remain loyal to the country pakistan and the cause of accession of the state of jammu and kashmir to pakistan
6906246 what kind of freedom struggle is that which kills its own people we cannot continue like this where the foreign mercenaries continue to kill the local inhabitants

6906251 and the collective conscience of the society will only be satisfied if capital punishment is awarded to the offender
6906252 the appellant who is a surrendered militant and who was bent upon repeating the acts of treason against the nation is a menace to the society and his life should become extinct
6906253 i counted six men getting out of the car but only five were killed the closed circuit tv camera recording clearly showed the six men
6906254 i did interrogate and torture him afzal at my camp for several days and we never recorded his arrest in the books anywhere his description of torture at my camp is true that was the procedure those days and we did pour petrol in his ass and gave him electric shocks but i could not break him he did not reveal anything to me despite our hardest possible interrogation he looked like a bhondu fool those days what you call a chootya idiot type and i had a reputation for torture interrogation and breaking suspects if anybody came out of my interrogation clean nobody would ever touch him again he would be considered clean for good by the whole department

6906258 at that time antony fortuny still suspected that part of the boys mental deficiencies were due to his diet which was far too influenced by his mothers french cooking it was a well known fact that the richness of buttery foods led to moral ruin and confusion of the intellect

6906262 we have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances
6906263 the crisis is if you are losing customers and we have resolved that issue almost everywhere
6906264 who is going to want to buy city link when it is losing money and who is in the best place to fix it i am convinced we can do it in three to four years time we can think about our portfolio
6906265 ill be going some time this year and that is still what ill be doing and its not a reflection of the government or anything else its just that i am a goat and i came in from the private sector and ill go back out to the private sector
6906266 come to a conclusion about how best to configure a uk trade and investment body
6906267 what has concerned us is the violence the disruptions that has led us to be concerned about the safety of our employees our equipment and investment and of the viability of the process
6906268 we need to protect our people how would we be able to bring our managers and their families if they are going to get beaten if anybody is under the impression that because we have made a large investment of 15bn rupees 184m we would not move then they are wrong because we would move to protect our people
6906269 tata say they have no plan b the factory is nearly complete and the money is spent in west bengal if they start again somewhere else it will take time and there will be a cost implication however nano will be loss making at this price so tata may save some money in that way
6906270 its disastrous the real problem is the way that land was acquired by government strong arming people into selling their land
6906271 i think the real question here is whether indians want to remain starving peasants or part of an urban proletariat my bet is the latter
6906272 i think we are seeing local people having a say in the process and sometimes projects are pulled just recently 11 dams were cancelled after local protests in sikkim
6906273 industrialisation has been violent in other countries but i think indian democracy can accommodate it without the violence
6906274 all three divisions are growing strongly and the business has real momentum our focus on europes diverse transport markets gives us resilience and great potential for further growth
6906275 results were slightly ahead of our forecasts due to better than expected performance of the uk bus division
6906276 we have attractive value for money propositions for fare paying passengers looking to switch from more fuel intensive car and air journeys and for public authorities as they acknowledge the proven financial benefits of private sector delivery
6906277 we are confident of reporting considerable revenue and earnings growth for the full year
6906278 millions upon millions of pounds continue to pour into shareholders pockets todays announcement perfectly illustrates why britains rail and bus services must be returned to public ownership

6906280 tog jeg en meget tidlig morgen forbi hans g rd og piftede begge cykelslangehjul h hvor var den dag god
6906281 para el pr ximo a o se tendr el tiempo de preparar la forma en c mo el ministerio asumir a el 70 aspiramos que para el 2009 la situaci n sea otra
6906282 la idea era dar una lucha fuerte en esta materia no quisimos hacer de esto un tema compulsivo s lo aspiramos a que el a o que viene sea manejado al 100 el tema de la inclusi n
6906283 que dentro del marco de la gratuidad de la ense anza es una obligaci n del ministerio establecer que los cursos intensivos sean gratuitos por lo menos con el pago de aranceles o matr culas aspiramos a que el pr ximo a o podamos incorporarlos al presupuesto de las universidades
6906284 es posible que se pueda establecer un mecanismo de pago para esta deuda que supera dos veces el presupuesto del ministerio de educaci n superior
6906285 paralelamente el ejecutivo busca instaurar una propuesta nica sin escuchar a las otras partes del pa s
6906286 lo hicimos con fuerza y convicci n para darle poder al pueblo no fue as y por ello marisabel rodr guez y ra l baduel nos pusimos al lado del pueblo rompimos con el presidente el enga o hab a llegado a su fin
6906287 enfrentar las leyes no es un problema legal es un asunto pol tico y el pueblo lo entiende bien no es ir al tsj para solicitar nulidades consultas o pedir interpretaciones quien quiera hacerlo que lo haga y estamos dispuestos a acompa arlo el problema central detr s de esas normas es que el pueblo est siendo despojado del poder que conquist en la constituci n un poder que conquist no s lo en lo legal sino fundamentalmente en la lucha pol tica y social de los ltimos a os
6906288 las elecciones frenar n definitivamente este proyecto personal que se quiere imponer al pueblo
6906289 hasta d nde esa voracidad del gobierno por sacarles el dinero de los bolsillos a los pobres por qu subsidiar casas en el exterior a costa del sacrificio del pueblo la expropiaci n de cemex es m s sensacionalista y para decir que no hay cemento en el mundo para construir viviendas la verdad es que este gobierno es el que menos viviendas ha hecho en los ltimos 60 a os desde marcos p rez jim nez todo est hecho a conciencia por eso es imperdonable que el contenido de las leyes vaya en sentido contrario a las aspiraciones del pueblo
6906290 resulta que no es s lo ser rico sino que ahora ganarse el pan con un trabajo propio tambi n es malo un sistema que no acumule capital est condenado a muerte pero esto parece no importarle al gobierno
6906291 todas las normas establecen un ministerio como rector un administrador ninguna incorpora la organizaci n popular ni las decisiones del pueblo tienen un car cter vinculante los consejos comunales han quedado reducidos a entes del estado subordinados a la presidencia y a los ministros y sus voceros al papel de funcionarios p blicos de hecho los consejos ser n parte del poder constituido del estado y sometidos al r gimen del control fiscal por manejar dineros p blicos
6906292 el presidente ha legislado para darse a s mismo un poder desmesurado abusivo da ino para el pa s
6906293 ya no estamos ante un gobierno socialista sino ante un estado socialista que est confiscando la propiedad privada
6906294 las leyes tienden a generar no esa felicidad de la que habla el presidente sino una gran dependencia del estado al no haber sector privado perdemos mucha soberan a alimentaria con estas leyes eso trae escasez desempleo y malestar para todos los venezolanos
6906295 nosotros haremos las acciones que tengamos que hacer ya sabemos la manera como fueron impuestas estas leyes que son ideologizantes controladoras y centralistas y ya vimos c mo se ha empezado a actuar con base en ellas disparo primero y averiguo despu s es la ley que est aplicando el gobierno
6906296 d jenme decirles que si los estudiantes trancan las calles o si los habitantes de petare toman el paso en la carretera santa luc a son reos de los nuevos delitos tipificados en los art culos 139 y 147 de la ley para la defensa de las personas en el acceso a los bienes y servicios que penaliza con 10 y hasta 20 a os de c rcel por eso creo que el presidente nos est diciendo que viene una crisis econ mica sin precedentes en la historia venezolana y de all estas amenazas contra la libertad de expresi n
6906297 en venezuela se est creando la generaci n de la pobreza todos hombres y mujeres se van a convertir en unos enfranelados obedientes del gobernante de turno
6906298 compendio de arbitrariedades que ameritan toda la atenci n del pueblo venezolano
6906299 o campeonato italiano desta temporada deve ser muito disputado pois os clubes se refor aram muito a inter de mil o sempre dif cil de ser superada pois tem uma grande equipe e venceu os ltimos tr s italianos
6906300 sempre muito bom iniciar a temporada com um t tulo e vamos tentar o bicampeonato da supercopa teremos um cl ssico dif cil contra a inter de mil o mas queremos a vit ria
6906301 a diretoria da roma manteve a base do time da ltima temporada quando conquistamos a copa da it lia e o vice campeonato italiano e contratou jogadores importantes como j lio baptista e riise

6906306 i think its a joke we know they cant raise the money from everything weve heard
6906307 they are misleading the market its about time they put up or shut up their original press release has been blown out of the water
6906308 the takeover panel should do something about it gfk should explain themselves they have misled the market and been economical with the actualit it was disingenuous and outrageous to put that release out
6906309 a serious and substantial investor and talks are progressing very well
6906310 this whole bid has been a terrible process all is fair in love and war but theyre not doing the business much good
6906311 the value of the local sponsorship for 2012 is much greater now than it was three or four weeks ago because of the performance of the team they have done a good deal
6906312 the fact this number of verification measures has been taken in relation to one company when there is a developing corporate conflict between the russian and foreign shareholders of the tnk bp group over a short period of time provides a basis for concluding that there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate as well as a possible interest on its part in the outcome of the inspections
6906313 all their actions were purposefully focused on imposing the administrative liability of rw dudley alone the unambiguous conclusion is that the said officials were carrying out somebodys orders and we request that this be investigated
6906314 all the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law
6906315 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
6906316 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
6906317 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
6906318 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
6906319 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
6906320 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
6906321 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
6906322 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
6906323 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
6906324 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
6906325 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients
6906326 we would expect this offer to be accepted around 60 is held by six shareholders including three benfield executives the intention is to build a major reinsurance broker
6906327 after the disposal unite will have no presence in the cities where the sale assets are located that is unite is exiting cities where it does not want or cannot achieve critical mass and returns comparable with higher growth locations for example london
6906328 gamestops comments suggest continued market strength and any further step up in used game sales would clearly be a positive for game group margins and profit forecasts
6906329 the fed looks firmly on hold for many months caught between ongoing inflation concerns existing relatively low rates and the financial storm he talks about
6906330 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
6906331 nevertheless the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain not least because of the difficulty of predicting the future course of commodity prices and we will continue to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely the fed is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to attain that objective
6906332 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
6906333 right now the situation is still getting worse and i would say that i dont see any early end to that
6906334 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
6906335 theyre too big to fail that doesnt mean that the equity cant get wiped out and it almost has in a practical sense as institutions they dont have any net worth

6906362 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6906363 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
6906364 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6906365 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6906366 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6906367 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6906368 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that

6906480 i applaud vestas for continuing to invest in colorado this time in pueblo and bringing new jobs to one of the greatest communities in the state
6906481 vestas decision to locate what will be the worlds largest wind tower manufacturing plant here in pueblo demonstrates that our new energy economy is benefiting every corner of colorado
6906482 the size of this facility when its fully operational in 2010 will produce 50 percent of what we have now on the globe

6906488 sen john mccain and his wife did not get a sweetheart deal from a fraud embezzler like tony rezko to buy their houses
6906489 got all kinds of sweetheart deals with convicted chicago businessman antoin rezko
6906490 h e sen john mccain and his wife did not get a sweetheart deal from a fraud embezzler like tony rezko to buy their houses but the messiah did the messiah got all kinds of sweetheart deals with rezko and who knows who else
6906491 the couple who sold barack obama his chicago home said the illinois senators 1 65 million bid was the best offer and they didnt cut their asking price because a campaign donor bought their adjacent land according to e mails between obamas presidential campaign and the seller
6906492 the previous owners of obamas house say there was no rezko discount and generally via his campaign exonerate him though rezko did tour the place with obama
6906493 c ouple who sold obama his illinois home said his 1
6906494 t he appraisal did note that the other parcel rezkos remaining parcel would be fully developable if he sold this to me and so rather than pay the appraised price i paid one sixth of the cost of his property he agreed to sell that 10 foot strip

6906496 said that if the bill passed and a nine month old fetus survived this late term abortion and was deemed to be a person who had a right to live and a right to medical care that the law would forbid abortions to take place which is just you know medically false
6906497 and there was some suggestion that we might be able to craft something that might meet constitutional muster with respect to caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion unfortunately this bill goes a little bit further and so i just want to suggest not that i think itll make too much difference with respect to how we vote that this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a previable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or the other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a a child a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place i mean it it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute for that purpose i think it would probably be found unconstitutional
6906498 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
6906499 for one moment one shining moment she was the most important woman in the whole wide universe
6906500 thought poudre school district you know im trusting them that theyre going to take care of my child

6906507 that there is protocol in place that these nurses are trained for this to be up there with all these children
6906508 the symptoms of altitude sickness and the flu are very similar
6906509 i put myself in her position i probably wouldve made the exact same decision
6906510 she missed all of the neurological changes in him and thats really scary
6906511 if you change the program like we have and say every time a kid has a headache or stomach ache were going to call 911 that isnt going to work

6906513 we take the safety and welfare of our students very seriously
6906514 perhaps the most important one is a safety coordinator for each trip
6906515 we want parents to really believe that this is a wonderful outdoor opportunity and that its a very safe experience for their children
6906516 anytime something like this happens were going to look at our practices and make improvements based on that
6906517 so when parents ask me do you think its safer i have no idea if theyve followed through with anything they said they were going to follow through with
6906518 nobody acted and thats what was so frustrating for us

6906526 it will be an inconvenience and people may have to park farther away but i understand why village officials did this
6906527 people were parking illegally sometimes this will be a safer environment
6906528 im distressed by the lack of data of any sort even at the most basic level

6906558 theres always a little bit of a pressure but not more than i can handle you just have to perform under pressure thats what the best do the guys that become great perform under pressure
6906559 you can see that focus on the field because hes been more consistent and thats what its going to take to get him to the next level
6906560 the basic program could be underway if every decision was not constantly being re litigated and if key stakeholders would collaboratively work the issues
6906561 the thing that has slowed everything down is this conflict between odni and atl so its hard for them to blame anyone but themselves
6906562 ive been told for a year now that this was schedule driven but now they come out with this
6906563 fully accountable for the contract and expenditure of these funds
6906564 should clearly document the requirements associated with the government purchase and operation of two satellites
6906565 provides woefully insufficient time to coordinate allocating only one half business day on an issue which is complex is interagency and has been presented at separate times to the deputies and principals of the respective organizations to make decisions
6906566 john young is objecting quite properly in my view and demonstrating that there are numerous issues yet to be resolved whats particularly interesting is that he seems to be reopening some issues that had previously appeared to be closed
6906567 a couple of months ago there seemed to be this move to joint decisions now they seem to be going the other way
6906568 she loves her family thats very important to me and shes a very good humanitarian i just think that shes very balanced since she had her son i think that in all aspects of her life shes been very grateful for the gift that she has and she shares with other people i just think thats great
6906569 my birthday was in june so he booked this trip because he knew celine was going to be here
6906570 she has such a beautiful voice its just so peaceful it seems to be so natural

6906572 i like attention i love men i like the glam outfits and the role playing i love being able to go nude in front of strangers i want them to enjoy my body i like to make men laugh in clubs i like to talk to them at stage side when theyre watching me dance
6906573 i hope that every guy who sees these pictures messes himself i hope they shoot out big gobs of cum on my photos i really get worked up thinking about that

6906579 imagine tactical combat type situations where commanders in part of a region want to understand the location and states of all the platforms equipment and personnel in real time
6906580 at wustl we have a programmable network platform that can scale real time information sharing over several orders of magnitude from a handful of interconnected platforms to thousands and tens of thousands the core idea is information sharing what had been lacking was knowledge of platform components now we have that knowledge and can try it out
6906581 this type of tactical operation doesnt have much to do with flying planes or operating tanks
6906582 it has more to do with understanding people and their relationships the underpinnings of knowing that rely upon networking and information management
6906583 thats the kind of thing that i hope our network can do
6906584 in a short amount of time you should be able to have not only video feeds from the predator but feeds from individual soldiers in the field

6906602 weve re branded our company so we thought it would be neat to give the artist community an outlet to paint
6906603 a lot of these people especially the graffiti artists dont really have anywhere to paint in the city so we thought this would be a great outlet for them as you can see we have kids and all sorts of people taking a stab at it
6906604 not at all we respect that the city is trying to get rid of graffiti but its not going to stop someone from being an artist and wanting to be an artist so this is a legal and safe way to do whatever you want on the side of a truck

6906628 the intention here is to make this one skew young and give it a contemporary vibe
6906629 as a network obviously we look at battlestar galactica thats set the standard in terms of tense character drama stargate does not have the intensity of a battlestar galactica but it may well be somewhere in between brad and robert are very eager to keep the action and adventure and the sense of humor in stargate universe but i think theres an opportunity to maybe inject a bit more dramatic intensity into the series but thats obviously a conversation for them as they start to script and move into development
6906630 whats unique about this chapter is its going to be set entirely in space
6906631 theyre on a ship the destiny thats also an opportunity for us because as battlestar galactica reaches a conclusion its nice for us to have within the mix of programming a space opera that serves the audience thats really into in space operas
6906632 obviously i cant say much about it at this point but suffice it to say that it should include the entire cast in addition to a certain gaunt and pallid flowing locked guest star and if it proves anywhere as successful as the first two sg 1 direct to video features you can be assured that this will be the first in a long long line of stargate atlantis movies

6906636 some of the very large boats are so bad if you are sitting on your balcony or patio and they go by on the other side of the lake youll have to stop your conversation because you cant hear its that loud
6906637 its an issue for a huge number of people the website basically says we are asking the fine be drastically increased and at a second offence the boat be impounded and not allowed back in the water until the exhaust is permanently fixed
6906638 as i understand it it only adds about a 5 increase so if people werent allowed to do it it isnt going to have any appreciable effect on the enjoyment of the boat
6906639 the fine is just 115 a lot of those boats spend that much on gas in an hour so its not a significant fine as far they are concerned the rcmp do their best but they dont have the resources to enforce properly
6906640 t theres more to online privacy than cookies as cookies are only one implementation of content that can disclose information to websites in some discussions people have also described ie7s phishing filter as a privacy feature because it helps protect users from sharing information the larger challenge here is notifying users clearly about what sites theyre disclosing information to and enabling them to control that disclosure if they choose as we talk more about privacy we will broaden the discussion to include additional protections from sharing information that the browser can offer users

6906846 what they do is they push the breasts together at the front because
6906847 on top of that youre doing a lot of physical activity so youre sweating what will happen is youll start to build up skin irritation and it can develop into some type of infection that would be extremely uncomfortable

6906865 one is that we can avoid the ethical issues of stem cells because wisdom teeth are destined to be thrown away anyway
6906866 also we used teeth that had been extracted three years ago and had been preserved in a freezer that means that its easy for us to stock this source of stem cells
6906867 because extractions of wisdom teeth are commonly operated in dental clinics we can expect a lot of donors of stem cells
6906868 that enable us to create stem cells of various genetic codes eliminating the risk that a body of a patient would reject transplanted tissues or organs

6906878 the president and every american wants to see american troops come home but not until the job is done and there is more security more political progress and more economic progress inside iraq
6906879 the security in baghdad allowed the government to come together and make some of the political reconciliation make some of the political progress that we all sought

6906892 with the checkoff the concept is only if citizens are actually willing to basically earmark at that time a dollar of their taxes to go to this program will it go there
6906893 certainly i think most people when theyre checking that box have no idea that theyre paying for party conventions in denver and st paul

6906905 main criteria would be a person that would allow us to sleep at night knowing that we had selected someone that could immediately be president of the united states

6906969 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt

6907012 they hate talking about it i think theyre a bit traumatised i keep dreaming about it too stars going out people being ripped apart screams
6907013 lots of people have that love we dont understand and that makes it more frightening
6907014 but why am i dreaming about when i didnt experience any of it

6907024 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6907025 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6907026 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6907027 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6907028 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6907029 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is

6907031 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6907032 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6907033 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6907034 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6907035 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6907036 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time

6907040 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6907041 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6907042 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6907043 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6907044 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6907045 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

6907058 she had a baby grand piano in the living room where she would play and sing
6907059 i loved the sense of proportion and light in my parents home it was beautiful but cold
6907060 i knew that if i was fortunate to have a modern home one day i would fill it with friendly furnishings i love modern architecture but i love my comfort too
6907061 they had an open house every weekend and after six months of walking by
6907062 we wanted to be as true as possible to the modern home but of equal importance was to make it comfortable
6907063 comfort in a modern home seems like an oxymoron modern homes back then were all about effect how did it look rather than how did it feel but it doesnt have to be that way
6907064 i think beautiful old pieces against a modern setting make them more exquisite
6907065 it creates a much more interesting chemistry dont you think

6907073 ive got a date with a trashy romance novel and a bubble bath
6907074 im sorry im really exhausted and to be honest i need a little alone time
6907075 i know but i dont think ive got enough energy for you two tonight
6907076 and that clean detergent y smell of your nightclothes youve been standing there for about five minutes i can assure you
6907077 are you going to join us or continue to stand there gaping
6907078 i didnt i wasnt planning to spy on you or anything
6907079 no i was just coming to find you i thought i didnt know
6907080 you were essentially watching a sort of masturbation just then yes in a way sort of so you know turnabout is fair play
6907081 so youre both just going to just sit there and watch while i see to myself not gonna touch me yourselves at all
6907082 she wants us to talk dirty to her you prawn
6907083 oh right words the right sound the right shape the right rhythm the power of words
6907084 were you trying to get him to masturbate in front of you
6907085 but thats not what you want to hear you want to hear about how badly i want to fuck you
6907086 she is exquisite isnt she spicy and salty and sweet just catching her scent makes me hard
6907087 and so hot and wet and slippery that first time i enter you rose sometimes i dont know how it is that i dont come immediately
6907088 i usually think about fixing the tardis or a slitheen or
6907089 do you remember when you wore that pink dress rose when we ended up in 1953 london
6907090 do you remember what i did when we got back to the tardis
6907091 i reached up under that dress under those charming crinolines
6907092 and your knickers were already wet what had you been thinking about while we were at that party
6907093 was wondering whether i could convince you to duck down an alley and take me up against the wall
6907094 you came so easily the first time i slid two fingers inside you right there in the control room you were so lovely with your cheeks flushed and your mouth open and those noises you make
6907095 i took you to your bedroom and got you out of that dress and i fucked you
6907096 well you have always made me feel a bit predatory consider at this very moment i want nothing more than to flip you over onto your hands and knees and take you from behind just like i did that night in 1953 i think im holding back remarkably well dont you
6907097 not being able to just makes me want it more
6907098 thats it come for us rose we want to see you make yourself come
6907099 i was starting to get a cramp in my jaw anyway
6907100 not that different from what you were just doing is it besides from what i understand there isnt a human male on earth who hasnt attempted it at least once and found himself not flexible enough i suspect if given the opportunity theres not a man alive who wouldnt relish making love to himself
6907101 so have you two been uh messing about without me like this the whole time
6907102 no actually tonight was a first wellll in these bodies anyway
6907103 wait a minute what dyou mean in these bodies youve done this before
6907104 this is the first time with one who looks exactly like me thats a bit strange i admit
6907105 i dont mind it though i mean look at me did you know even donna admitted i was a bit pretty
6907106 donna thinks i need to sit you two down and force feed you until you arent so skinny
6907107 i knew there was a reason i love you youre so clever
6907108 i love the way you feel when youve come once already
6907109 try not to come too quickly lets see if we can get rose there again
6907110 can i tell you how glad i am that you changed your mind about wanting alone time
6907111 i dont understand doctor its like sometimes you dont like him but you keep saying hes you and then tonight
6907112 i can feel you both aging i can hear it
6907113 i should have let the two of you alone somewhere somewhere you could be happy together for as long as youll live
6907114 i am in many ways a very selfish man rose
6907115 you ask how can we know the infinite i answer not by reason it is the office of reason to distinguish and define the infinite therefore cannot be ranked among its objects you can only apprehend the infinite by a faculty superior to reason by entering into a state in which
6907116 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6907117 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6907118 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6907119 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6907120 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6907121 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6907122 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6907123 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6907124 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6907125 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6907126 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6907127 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6907128 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6907129 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6907130 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6907131 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6907132 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6907133 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6907134 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6907135 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6907136 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6907137 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6907138 hey greg laden im remembering that i was in such and such a place doing such and such a thing about two years ago and got an email from you telling me you had just gotten married so this must be your approximate anniversary well happy anniversary

6907141 and now julia will read a letter that greg wrote to amanda
6907142 right i knew about the letter but nobody gave me a copy of it and now everybody is looking at me and i can see my dad asking the person doing the ceremony if she has a copy of the letter and dad is starting to search through his pockets like he does every morning looking for his cell phone i wonder how this is going to turn out
6907143 holy crap where is that letter it might be back in the motel room lets see thats about 300 meters away if someone has the key i can sprint there and back in how many minutes
6907144 increasingly the potential for innovative thought and new medical therapies is jeopardized by threats aimed at researchers and their families
6907145 we need to send a message that violence or serious threats of violence are never the answer
6907146 naturally we are very pleased and we appreciate such strong bipartisan from the senate on what we view as a very important public safety issue
6907147 i came in and there were police officers outside they handed me a leaflet saying dont be worried theyre just looking into the neighbourhood there have been three terror arrests
6907148 it was quite hard to see which houses because there were crowds of people outside and two police cars and a van its really worrying that its so close you cant believe its actually happening on your street in your community
6907149 you dont expect it on your doorstep but thats life it could happen anywhere
6907150 they were a law abiding family theyve never been in any trouble whatsoever theyre normal everyday lads
6907151 he concentrates on the real issues and has good common sense judgement
6907152 there was an endless stream of people going to boris
6907153 and being politicians they didnt say parker is always in my back they said parker is exceeding his brief
6907154 he went to boris and said parker is acting like hes the mayor not you either he goes or i do
6907155 so boris was put in a position where he had to grasp the nettle even though he didnt want to because boris hasnt learnt yet that in politics you cant be everyones friend
6907156 during the election campaign no one had much time to think what would happen if they won
6907157 getting a friend of francis maude tim parker in to run the show seemed like a good idea at the time
6907158 they told parker boris is not a detail man you can do all that tim parker thought the deal was that he would run london and boris would put the bubbles in the champagne boris had a different view parker and boris didnt talk enough to each other there was a lack of political experience all round
6907159 boriss team is now overly represented by a group of undistinguished tory councillors all of them pretty low grade with the exception of milton
6907160 the danger is boris will let them have too much sway and theyll run a tame mayoralty which will miss the chance to do radical things theyll muddle on as theyve always done while boris continues to amuse the nation the other danger is that boris will take on too much himself particularly after saying that hes taking over as chair of tfl because the decisions are all political and thats not his area of competence
6907161 boris and cameron are very different types they went to the same school but thats where their similarity ends
6907162 but if labour can pin on us the idea that this is what happens when inexperienced tories get into power they couldnt run a whelk stall it could be very damaging
6907163 when you have a 71 year old presidential candidate its particularly important that voters be confident that hes backed up by an experienced and qualified vice president prepared to step in and do the exact opposite about everything except iraq
6907164 ill attempt to start hitting some balls for the first time and see if my wrist is strong enough and up to it yet
6907165 what i do from there will depend on what i do sunday
6907166 if its okay then ill probably stay around for a few extra days and get what batting i can if its no good then ill probably go back home and join up with the guys before we head off to the champions trophy
6907167 cest lun des plus gros contrats de lhistoire du pentagone et la date de d p t des dossier octobre est inad quate a argument une s natrice de letat de washington qui soutient la d marche de lindustriel

6907169 ce serait injuste pour boeing de ne pas lui laisser le temps de r viser sa proposition
6907170 ces avions seront en service pendant 40 ou 60 ans et il vaut mieux prendre une bonne d cision
6907171 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6907172 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6907173 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6907174 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6907175 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6907176 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6907177 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6907178 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6907179 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6907180 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6907181 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6907182 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6907183 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6907184 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6907185 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6907186 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6907187 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6907188 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6907189 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6907190 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6907191 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6907192 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6907193 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6907194 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
6907195 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
6907196 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills

6907200 there is quite some concern in the community particularly young people about mobile phone premium services
6907201 at times the lack of proper disclosure of terms and conditions may mislead consumers in breach of the trade practices act
6907202 who have been confused or misled by certain marketing techniques
6907203 there is an industry scheme in place regulating the provision of mobile premium services
6907204 active steps are being taken to review this and the government encourages industry to continue this work
6907205 whats a new york loft like me doing in a place like this
6907206 i came here yesterday for a full checkup and new glasses
6907207 well hes going to die soon anyway so why dont you just put him down now
6907208 the doctor has a 1 000 things to do she cant take the time to speak or meet with you
6907209 we shall be doing everything possible to provide as much capacity and information during this particularly difficult period
6907210 this year with a cooler summer having scuppered many families uk beach holiday plans were expecting a real rush and this combined with the music festivals means we are gearing up for a busy time
6907211 it really doesnt look too bad it isnt going to be scorching hot sunshine but it isnt going to be soaking wet either
6907212 we are having to amend the legislation because you can get to a lot of places and back in three days we are playing catch up to close that loophole and it is a concern that it is there work is already in place to change the law so that the three day window is closed
6907213 at the moment we can place foreign travel orders on convicted sex offenders which stop them going abroad once on the sex offenders register but they have to be applied for through the magistrates courts and only last six months
6907214 we plan to extend that period and to introduce the immediate removal of an offenders passport these things are going to come in but they are not in place at the moment we hope they will be introduced as soon as possible
6907215 falls far far below what is acceptable for western european standards of justice
6907216 mr gadd is pleased to be back in this country the last few days as you know he has been travelling around asia and that time was not wasted
6907217 mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety
6907218 these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his well being im pleased to say thats in place
6907219 mr gadd is pleased to be back for another reason he is pleased to be back because for the first time he can appear before a court of justice he tells me that his trial in vietnam was a charade was a travesty of justice
6907220 i have just been informed by my chief that we have lost one of our chaps over the wall we think its blake
6907221 the one doing 42 years he went over the east wall hes probably in prison grey look im a bit tucked up at the moment im in the middle of releasing a man ill ring you back when i get more information
6907222 has a history of mental instability is incapable of dissociating fact and fantasy
6907223 the escape plot was a figment of blanks psychopathic tendencies he may even have gone to the length of approaching blake
6907224 it appears we did not do anything to deny the story to the people at the time
6907225 i feel we owe it to blake without prejudice to his right to seek redress in law to deny the story and ask for a correction such a denial should take the form of a letter from the director of prisons and clarify the fact that blake was no way involved
6907226 an extremely delicate source has indicated that shortly before christmas an unnamed man arrived in east berlin who was considered important enough to be met by the deputy head of the kgb this individual possessed only the clothes he stood up in the possibility that this man was blake cannot be discounted
6907227 at long last i am able to write to let you know that i am well and in complete safety so that you need not worry about me any more i would have written much earlier but in the very special circumstances that i found myself it was impossible to get in touch longing though i was to do so even now for reasons over which i have no control i cannot tell you where i am
6907228 mammie i need not tell you how worried i am about you and how i am longing for the day when i can hear from you courage mother and take good care of yourself you are always in my thoughts all my love and kisses poek blakes dutch nickname who hopes to see you soon
6907229 work on the design feasibility testing business case and procurement elements of the identity cards programme
6907230 if they cannot handle data for 84 000 prisoners they will certainly not be able to handle it for 61 million citizens
6907231 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco at a cost of millions of pounds to the uk taxpayer this will destroy any grain of confidence the public still have in this white elephant
6907232 if the government goes through with its plan for an id card scheme presumably other private companies will be given access to the personal data of everyone in the country what will stop the data of all of us falling in to the wrong hands
6907233 its a great honor for us to win afghanistans first medal for the olympics
6907234 some thought the presumptive republican nominee didnt do a good enough job making his case to the general electorate after having sown up the republican nomination while his rivals in the opposition party were still slugging it out for the democratic nod
6907235 as people slow start focusing on the presumptive democratic nominee they realize that theres not much substance to his eloquent speeches
6907236 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6907237 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6907238 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6907239 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6907240 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6907241 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6907242 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6907243 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
6907244 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6907245 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6907246 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6907247 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6907248 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6907249 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6907250 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6907251 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6907252 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6907253 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6907254 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6907255 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6907256 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6907257 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6907258 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6907259 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6907260 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6907261 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6907262 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6907263 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6907264 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6907265 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6907266 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6907267 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6907268 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6907269 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6907270 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6907271 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6907272 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6907273 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6907274 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6907275 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6907276 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6907277 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6907278 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6907279 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6907280 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6907281 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6907282 france 2 le 25 avril 2007 soit entre les deux tours de l lection pr sidentielles
6907283 tenemos otra persona muerta en palm beach que perdi el control de su veh culo a causa de la tormenta lamentablemnte la cifra de muertos ascendi a siete en florida
6907284 no salga a la calle a menos que las autoridades locales indiquen que es seguro hacerlo
6907285 estamos esperando reunir toda la informaci n que env an los condados para poder dar cifras de afectados y evacuados
6907286 obviously hes having to deal with the trauma of what has happened and were offering whatever support we can
6907287 for an 18 year old any tragedy like that is going to be a while for it to sink in
6907288 my iron shots went really well and the putter went well too
6907289 all i have to do now is play well tomorrow and i have to play well in the finals
6907290 hes so mentally strong theres a ball in the rough to him its just a ball to hit when hes over a putt he thinks he can make every putt
6907291 attitudes towards drinking and driving throughout the eastern bay of plenty need to change
6907292 of the eight crashes five can be contributed to alcohol as a major factor
6907293 your service is much better then your competitors template pages available are great user experience for those who answers our questions on the web is much superior
6907294 it is sad that some radical secularist groups are trying to eliminate one of our oldest and most cherished american traditions
6907295 public officials throughout our country need to be encouraged and reminded that they can and should resist the increasingly radical demands of secularist groups with regard to invocations before public meetings
6907296 our countrys founding fathers opened their meetings with prayer those who oppose christian invocations are essentially arguing that the founders were violating the constitution as they were writing it
6907297 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6907298 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6907299 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
6907300 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6907301 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6907302 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6907303 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6907304 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6907305 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6907306 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6907307 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6907308 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6907309 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6907310 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6907311 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6907312 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6907313 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6907314 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6907315 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6907316 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6907317 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6907318 its time to enjoy our moment we played a really bad game against the u s you know but now we learn a lot from that experience and we want to try to win the finals
6907319 we are going to be ready for sure we are going to play better than the other game that is no question we are in the finals for something and we are going to try to win
6907320 i was just trying to play the game they were just down there trying to be physical i was trying to be physical back with them
6907321 it was a little bit chirpy out there but nothing personal nothing major they were trying to win and we were trying to win
6907322 weve got to play better than what we did tonight
6907323 im not saying we played bad but we did want to be better than we were tonight
6907324 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6907325 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6907326 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6907327 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6907328 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6907329 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6907330 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6907331 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6907332 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days
6907333 we got beat up today what are you going to do
6907334 they came out swinging the bats they hit the ball all over the park and out of it
6907335 you know its good to hit a grand slam but i would rather it have been against somebody else
6907336 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6907337 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6907338 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6907339 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6907340 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6907341 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6907342 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6907343 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6907344 we want to tell the new skycity ceo nigel morrision not to be a rat and treat his staff decently
6907345 after all he is one of new zealand s highest paid ceos yet proposes to pay his workers the minimum wage and a wage offer to the rest of his staff that is less than the inflation rate
6907346 the most valuable tool owned and used by a photographer is not one that is paid for with money
6907347 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6907348 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6907349 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6907350 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6907351 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6907352 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6907353 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6907354 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6907355 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6907356 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6907357 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights
6907358 if and when they are deemed ready they will be returned to direct care but under a shift supervisor
6907359 its outrageous to think we have it on video tape this neglect and a patients death and that somebody in charge would get counseling
6907360 both riches and honor come from you and you reign over all
6907361 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in christ
6907362 the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becomes unfruitful
6907363 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon
6907364 or do you despise the riches of his goodness forbearance and long suffering not knowing that the goodness of god leads you to repentance
6907365 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had prepared beforehand for glory even us whom he called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles
6907366 in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace
6907367 oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out
6907368 that you may know what is the hope of his calling what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
6907369 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might through his spirit in the inner man
6907370 and my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus
6907371 come now you rich weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you your riches are corrupted and your garments are moth eaten your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have heaped up treasure in the last days
6907372 for in one hour such great riches came to nothing
6907373 but now he has obtained a more excellent ministry inasmuch as he is also mediator of a better covenant which was established on better promises
6907374 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
6907375 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6907376 a fun read with a very realistic portrayal of romance dog ownership and the struggle to find yourself in new york city
6907377 s temos o programa que vai ao ar at a pr xima segunda feira da em diante vamos ter que refazer tudo
6907378 a garantia de um direito que os povos ind genas reclamam de tomar decis es para seu povo e se torna uma maneira de fortalecer o estado incluindo os ind genas com base na igualdade na democracia e no respeito aos direitos humanos
6907379 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul
6907380 stand up for what is right even if youre the only one standing and most of the time you will be
6907381 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6907382 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6907383 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6907384 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6907385 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6907386 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6907387 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6907388 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6907389 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6907390 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6907391 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6907392 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6907393 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6907394 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6907395 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6907396 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6907397 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6907398 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6907399 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6907400 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
6907401 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
6907402 the 4 1 2 year military strategy failed because it was a poorly planned amp poorly executed
6907403 i end up either hurting them or making them change their mind about me either way they end up hating me in the end
6907404 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

6907406 there were some behind the scenes politics going on last year im not sure what it was and for some reason it involved your current chair

6907422 there are two great sins in the world the sin of ignorance and the sin of stupidity only the former may be overcome
6907423 our major goal in creating a stadium specific website was to effectively help drive our sales marketing and communications efforts for tcf bank stadium
6907424 tcfbankstadium com is a one stop shop for anything and everything related to the stadium
6907425 when it comes to raising funds for the tcf bank stadium one of the four pillars of our efforts was to have a strong website presence and this site certainly accomplishes that goal
6907426 the new tcfbankstadium com website is a terrific vehicle for us to quickly and easily communicate with both fans and patrons all the amenities that tcf bank stadium has to offer and moving forward it will be the centerpiece for football ticket and premium seating information as well as stadium fund raising efforts

6907429 we believe that progressive modulation is an unfair system complex to administer and one that would result in land being split into smaller less efficient units with resultant job losses
6907430 if my sfp looks like it is going to be capped i will either downsize the business shed livestock and labour or split the holding either way the result will be smaller inefficient farming to reward people for being less efficient is very regressive
6907431 register to vote its your right as a citizen of the united states arent we so lucky there is no guarantee whatsoever that your actual vote will be counted but dont let that dissuade you from tromping down to wherever the hell your polling place is come rain or shine or snow and cast that vote isnt it great to be an american
6907432 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
6907433 i cant provide odds on whether dropped votes were not recognized
6907434 but based on what we know about how our customers run their elections and reconcile counts we believe any results not uploaded on election night would have been caught when elections were being certified
6907435 voters in jurisdictions premier serves both in ohio and throughout the country can be assured that election officials employing standard canvass and crosscheck procedures will count their votes completely and accurately
6907436 as far as i know we have not seen that problem
6907437 oh thank goodness now we will get a paper trail law before the next election
6907438 my mindset is always focused and determined to get it done i always had an x on my back at marshall and im thankful to have been coached by a great coach in dorothy gaters
6907439 were the favorites to win the gold medal here so its similar we have the x on our backs again
6907440 sometimes i have to pinch myself and realize this is in fact the olympics something ive wanted to play in my entire life
6907441 to be here is amazing i think its really going to take a few months for me to enjoy all this because everything has happened so fast the ncaas wnba the olympics and then back to the wnba
6907442 i think in october or november once i have that gold medal around my neck i will realize what has happened but right now it still doesnt even feel like i won the national championship i need to celebrate that still
6907443 the process has been long but everything weve worked hard for is here hopefully i can keep going to london and then we get the bid in chicago and i can play at home by that time ill be 31 i can do that
6907444 thats another circle i have to put on my calendar
6907445 i cant imagine getting tickets for all my family but thats a problem for another day
6907446 2008 i circled it on my calendar because i knew it was going to be a huge year
6907447 the thing about a campaign is when you start getting over two players its cool to have that but the narrative quality decreases exponentially with more players once you get a third or a fourth player in there then youre in the middle of fighting a bad guy and somebodys triggering a cutscene and people are flapping their gums and nobody knows whats going on with the story whereas if you keep it two players keep it focused grab a buddy and go through the blockbuster experience and then grab five players and fight against the locust thats how were doing it
6907448 you can chip away at achievements in gears of war 2 essentially in every single mode
6907449 oh you know if you do 10 more of those you might start getting towards an achievement kind of adds that kind of psuedo rpg grind element in the background
6907450 i have played too human i think its a solid game
6907451 initially the project was to save the building and the history that elvis had left

6907462 sie machen in k rnten zum teil eine gute politik das spreche ich ihnen nicht ab
6907463 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6907464 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6907465 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6907466 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6907467 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6907468 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6907469 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6907470 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6907471 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for
6907472 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6907473 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6907474 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6907475 estamos demasiado contentos al fin se ha confirmado el concierto de madonna en nuestro pais

6907479 vive en sichuan y es protegido en una reserva natural llamada wa lung
6907480 solamente en abril y mayo buscan su pareja y con esta tienen una o dos cr as
6907481 debido a su poca facilidad de reproducci n adem s de la caza furtiva del hombre el panda gigante esta en peligro de extinci n
6907482 ahora en china est n utilizando la clonaci n en centros de reproducci n artificial para evitar su extinci n
6907483 anteriormente hab an muy pocos ejemplares gracias a la protecci n estatal sin duda van a aumentarse
6907484 es un animal de primera categor a osea que nadie puede tocarle ni un pelo
6907485 seguramente habr peligro de extinci n igual porque los humanos explotan los bosques y cada d a disminuye su habitad
6907486 como al oso panda le gusta comer bamb tenemos que proteger el medio ambiente y no destruir el equilibrio ecol gico solo as no habr peligro de extinci n
6907487 ahora en china se han establecido reservas naturales adem s de la reproducci n artificial eso ha hecho que en china haya 1 800 ejemplares ya no hay tanto peligro de extinci n
6907488 si fuera panda dir a que me siento muy feliz porque me quieren los pueblos del mundo y los chinos
6907489 si fuera oso panda me sentir a intimidada de que todos me vieran
6907490 me siento incomodo porque mucha gente viene a ver nuestra vida privada como vivimos
6907491 si me van a poner siempre en las vitrinas dir a que quiero estar en la naturaleza
6907492 la segunda de las 5 mascotas o fuwa de las olimpiadas es un panda se llama jing jing porque simboliza la uni n y paz en el mundo

6907496 est n entrando empresas grandes empresas y est n quitando terreno y va ha haber contaminaci n en el futuro

6907498 yo tengo raz n que si venden eso c mo vamos a vivir nosotros no
6907499 en ves de vender las tierras creo que deber an poner escuelas centros de salud

6907503 y en mi pueblo va a entrar una empresa y han dicho que mi pueblo tiene que salir de mi comunidad tiene que ir a otro sitio porque en mi comunidad hay petr leo y hay bastante pescado y mi comunidad est luchando por eso
6907504 y yo como shipiba yo quiero que no se venda la tierra porque de eso nosotros vivimos y que no talen los rboles porque eso nos da ox geno
6907505 y sin los rboles no ser amos nada no existir amos nosotros
6907506 yo quiero que el gobierno haga que ayuden a los ind genas porque all sufren hambre
6907507 si estuvieran los hospitales o los centros de salud yo creo que los j venes estar an m s sanos y as poder estudiar un poco m s y ser algo en la vida pues no
6907508 el gobierno tiene que hacer un intercambio de ideas o conversar con los pueblos ind genas
6907509 los pueblos ind genas tiene mucho que dar sobre todo a lo que se refiere a la interculturalidad y lo que es la identidad cultural
6907510 que nos ayuden m s porque yo de grande quiero ser algo
6907511 queremos que nos respeten tambi n porque nuestras madres shipibas nuestra cultura es importante para nosotros
6907512 eso no se hizo de un d a al otro eso fue por generaci n en generaci n nos gustar a seguir avanzando m s cada d a m s

6907561 non vogliamo che continui cos che nasca una moschea ogni quattro ore
6907562 enough of a fringe reception area to come to a full conclusion
6907563 we dont have any artificial preservatives artificial colorings artificial flavors things like that
6907564 thats going to be the freshest and the best grown with the highest standards and we find that the local farmers here in hawaii really meet those standards
6907565 we have an item that has all the same texture and color and flavor with none of the added preservatives or anything like that so we hope that people can enjoy their musubi with a natural option
6907566 i think that folks will find that we have the full gamut here from the very high value items and those items are very competitively priced through to those very very specialty items that are imported from around the world
6907567 i make no apologies that sometimes its a tough arena
6907568 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future

6907598 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6907599 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6907600 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6907601 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class
6907602 i think its a continuing trend it just really indicates just how difficult it is to make and manufacture cars comfortably in a market the size of australia
6907603 so this is putting immense pressure on local car manufacture for the current cycle of motor cars
6907604 i think therell be continuing pressure on the industry to restructure and of course to improve its efficiency
6907605 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
6907606 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
6907607 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars

6907643 does not have the right to erase then recast the age old definition of marriage as virtually all societies have understood it in order to satisfy its own contemporary notions of equality and justice
6907644 conclude on the basis of a perceived evolution in community values that the laws prohibiting polygamous and incestuous marriages were no longer constitutionally justified
6907645 in no way do i equate same sex unions with incestuous and polygamous relationships as a matter of social policy or social acceptance
6907646 the door to similar treatment of other less deserving claims of a right to marry
6907647 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6907648 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6907649 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6907650 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6907651 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6907652 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6907653 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6907654 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6907655 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6907656 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6907657 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6907658 if you trust every web site but not a government
6907659 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6907660 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6907661 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6907662 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6907663 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6907664 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6907665 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6907668 taylor has been with me for three years taylor as she would say about herself shes not the easiest person all the time i love her like family shes like one of my children and she is about keeping a very tight ship and theres no margin for error in what we do but i think that you will enjoy for better or for worse the dynamic between the two of them its not edited and is extremely real and there is absolutely no acting in this show i feel that style is peoples way of expressing themselves and their mood and i think if you notice it taylor is always in black and shes very dark and shes very hard brad is always in very happy clothes all the time and hes very dandy and very you know i think theyre equally as obsessed with fashion i think thats why anyone gets into this and im very lucky that they are they both have such incredible style

6907675 for a country like saudi arabia one of the most important sources of energy to look at and to develop is solar energy

6907682 we had no particular reason to change it the customers were used to the system we previously had
6907683 with the toll increase which is mandated by the project deed to increase in 50 cent increments and gst on top of that the toll increased to 2 75 so we took the opportunity to replace the part so it would accept the correct amount
6907684 you can see a lot of difference in the students faces
6907685 the students are good here without help but we see that our government cares about us its been a month and a half since they came to our school and asked what we needed and since then we have seen good progress
6907686 when the taliban was in power it was illegal for girls to go to school but we never forgot how important it is to educate all afghan children this school used to be housing for russian pilots but the government of afghanistan helped us make it usable as a place of education
6907687 a lot of families cant even afford to buy paper or a pen for their children

6907717 as we saw in our most recent reuters zogby poll that has mccain ahead nationally the dynamic of the race appears to be changing this battleground poll of 10 states reflects that change obama has lost some support to the point where he is now below the electoral college victory threshold
6907718 mccain could be tailor made for this states demographic and has the support of its very popular governor he understands the issues facing most floridians and relates well to huge swaths of the populace here this is an electorate that is more likely than others to put a premium on experience we are however watching libertarian bob barr from neighboring georgia who now sits at 5 percent but could hurt mccain going down the stretch a rising creative class and a tough economy in the south could also help obama
6907719 obama may have the edge now but mccains current national momentum leads us to hedge our bets on colorado and switch this state from blue to purple support for bob barr brings too much uncertainty to the call
6907720 mccain who won the gop presidential primary twice here with strong support from independents needs to win over conservatives obama needs to capitalize on the states voters worries about the economy and iraq again those people now for barr may well decide new hampshire

6907724 relations between iran and russia can best be described as a marriage of convenience
6907725 iranian leaders are aware of it the dependency and they resent it but there was very little they could do about it
6907726 following current developments in the caucasus and urge s the belligerent parties to resolve their disputes through peaceful means
6907727 our reticence only aids the camp that wishes us regional adversaries to remain silent while us supporters come to the support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili
6907728 a whole new set of options may be opening up for iran
6907729 this war in georgia was an early sign of escalating russian assertiveness
6907730 irans rather neutral stance on the caucasus can be read as a signal to the united states
6907731 if the united states was to open an interest section in iran perhaps neighboring countries such as turkmenistan would see this as the start of a thaw in us iranian relations the real opening they are waiting for in order to boost their trade or oil and gas shipments via iran
6907732 we thought that it would calm down after some time but then they marauders stole everything from my neighbors house and burnt it along with four others i decided to run
6907733 none of the dead were in military uniform all of them were civilians and there was no one to bury them
6907734 but my bull saved me because when we were stopped by some men who were chechens or cossacks they just patted it and let us go
6907735 in light of the grossly disproportionate scale of russias military actions the true purpose of its conduct is clear to secure both south ossetia and abkhazia as ethnically homogenous client states free from georgian political social or cultural influence and to prevent the return of ethnic georgians and others who would resist russias de facto annexation of the territories
6907736 i think it was such a large scale war that russia will also have some evidence to back its accusations against georgia
6907737 but definitely there are many more violations that have been conducted on the russian side

6907820 up to now the slightest criticism of radical islam on campus has been slammed as islamophobia while muslim groups and their radical fellow travelers have been allowed to say the most hateful things imaginable about christians and jews without any reaction from university administrators whatsoever
6907821 provost nikias has called the hadith on the msa website for what it is despicable given the atmosphere that prevails on most campuses today it was an act of integrity on his part to make this call and to demand that the msa live up to basic standards of civility that should govern the university
6907822 abu huraira reported allahs messenger may peace be upon him as saying the last hour would not come unless the muslims will fight against the jews and the muslims would kill them until the jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say muslim or the servant of allah there is a jew behind me come and kill him
6907823 the passage you cited is truly despicable and i share your concerns about its being on the usc server we did some investigations and i have ordered the passage removed
6907824 the passage in the hadith that you brought to our attention violates the usc principles of community and it has no place on a usc server
6907825 no one has the right to denigrate another human being on the basis of race sex sexual orientation national origin etc we will not tolerate verbal or written abuse threats harassment intimidation or violence against person or property
6907826 we commend usc for having the moral courage to stand up against those who hijack speech and religious freedoms and the goodwill of the campus community in order to spread hate and extremist violence
6907827 it also shows what kind of an organization the muslim students association is which is why the freedom center has launched a nationwide campaign stop the jihad on campus week which will culminate the week of october 13

6907831 when were given a rat nine times out of ten its not because theyre not loved its because people are not educated properly
6907832 for example a lot of our guys are accidents where people have bought a boy and a girl and then magically theres children
6907833 maybe a new film comes out and its flavour of the month so people go out and get a rat but all of a sudden its no i dont really want him anymore
6907834 for any pet you should have a licence as you can see with our guys weve got too many of them we are literally cleaning up other peoples messes
6907835 they are fantastic companions they are very clean and hygienic and theyre very very clever they are just a fantastic pet
6907836 if you havent got room for a dog you should get a rat
6907837 sometimes ross and kev have wondered why the hell we are doing this
6907838 ive said it several times but not quite as often because im slightly more in love with the animals
6907839 my motto is theres always room for one more because i cannot look at a creature and say no i cant do it its just not me
6907840 but i think they might have to restrain me at some point
6907841 gt reflections on the tenth anniversary of the supreme courts opinion in the on august 20 1998 the supreme court of canada handed down its landmark opinion in reference re secession of quebec 1998 2 s
6907842 would be tantamount to accepting that the national assembly legislature or government of quebec could purport to secede the province unilaterally from canada in disregard of canadian and international law
6907843 that the law may be broken as long as it can be broken successfully
6907844 contrary to the rule of law and must be rejected
6907845 t he constitution binds all governments both federal and provincial including the executive branch they may not transgress its provisions indeed their sole claim to exercise lawful authority rests in the powers allocated to them under the constitution and can come from no other source
6907846 made more plausible claims that the courts should have a role in reviewing and perhaps even striking down laws allegedly enacted in contravention of broad and open ended constitutional principles even where the provisions of the constitution are arguably not engaged in the debate over the validity of the impugned legislation
6907847 must be left to another day and to another forum

6907855 in fact lesley wasnt even aware that skip had been arrested
6907856 hayden found out about her dads arrest when he called her from jail they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
6907857 their marriage has the full support of their family and friends
6907858 peaches and max did not want unnecessary publicity but following growing media speculation have decided to set out the facts
6907859 peaches and max drummey are delighted to announce their very happy marriage
6907860 john terry has been captain of chelsea for quite a while that must have been an advantage
6907861 the difference here is that i operate my captains on seniority

6907867 all listed meetings will begin at 7 00 p m and will be held at plymouth town hall 11 lincoln street please call 508 726 1968 with any questions regarding these important meetings
6907868 i didnt do it nobody saw me do it you cant prove anything
6907869 they blame me and say were going to pass them tax losses right on to our citizens and youre causing their tax increase
6907870 ive got the facts to prove the state didnt cause their tax increase those are decisions made at the local level if they want to blame me ill challenge any of them to a public hall meeting in their own community and show them the facts
6907871 if he wants to come look at our budget and then show us how were being wasteful thats fine but i dont think the governors job is to fix local problems and tell local governments how to spend their money
6907872 legislation is often given attractive titles to improve its chances of passing
6907873 we spent a little bit more money on mail than i would have done if id done it myself
6907874 there was a decision or two made i would not have made
6907875 the idiots have realized their own idiocy hopefully they will join us and vote against themselves in the next elections
6907876 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6907877 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6907878 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6907879 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6907880 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6907881 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6907882 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6907883 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6907884 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6907885 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6907886 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6907887 if you trust every web site but not a government
6907888 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6907889 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6907890 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6907891 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6907892 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6907893 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6907894 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6907896 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
6907897 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
6907898 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
6907899 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
6907900 and he was like dont worry mon we got this one

6907913 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6907914 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6907915 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6907916 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6907917 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6907918 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6907919 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6907920 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6907921 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6907922 i said to my partner one thing were lucky about is that weve done so many stadium shows

6907929 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6907930 the main interest i have is that it gives the mother or a parent another option of what to do with a child before they do something drastic

6907932 drafters will sometimes try to say as little as possible so they dont create ambiguity but drafters here succeeded in writing the law in such a limited fashion that the entire provision is ambiguous
6907933 the sad thing is we have plenty of other mechanisms for people to use
6907934 im not sure the safe haven law is really going to help in a majority of cases
6907935 i should actually thank the government for helping me get my eye for an eye by showing you the evidence that youve seen the videos
6907936 helping me to take away your heart and your innocence
6907937 thats what they have done and i should thank them but i wont
6907938 it was a time for reflection that maybe they need to be more aggressive on price
6907939 the synergies between kbbreview expo and the tile amp stone show and floorstyle are so obvious joining together under one banner feels like a very natural fit
6907940 its great news for dmg and kick start but more significantly its great news for all the industries and sectors previously covered by the three shows it means a wider audience and the chance to expand the horizons of visitors into areas that perhaps they dont work with everyday but so clearly should im very excited that this partnership will result in an even more exciting and valuable show for everyone concerned
6907941 we always said that while the earls court show was an inconvenience we were more than confident that the industry was ultimately made up of professional business people and they would make their decision based on hard facts
6907942 the expo was always the most established show with the best credentials but now it is incorporating the tile amp stone show and floorstyle as well as the kbbreview industry awards it is in a different class
6907943 i am delighted that we are now part of a very constructive partnership with dmg the 2008 tile amp stone show and floorstyle events were very successful and now that were joining kbbreview expo theyve opened up to become a really significant part of a wider picture

6907961 when i grow up i want to do what you do
6907962 we really have to understand the heart of the product
6907963 for example if an electronic device has to convey a sense of quickness we will choose all the correct materials and finishes that will convey that thought and be appealing to their demographic our goal is to resonate with the consumer
6907964 we really looked at the bed as a room in and of itself
6907965 were in it for the long haul it must be a marriage of intuition and logic we arent about the collective hunch we do our homework
6907966 i define mine beyond that its about loving it long enough to want to keep it around
6907967 i thought i was going to have an idea factory when i grew up i was going to create ideas
6907968 its become like a neutral youre finding it so much more than you ever found it in china or korea pink is revered pink has become pervasive
6907969 we just worked on launching this whole new brand called coalesse thats trying to span the live work market those two environments are really overlapping its really important to understand what people are surrounding themselves with to create a space that serves both functions

6907971 orange ran its course and it got replaced by yellow yellow has become what i call the vitamin c for everyone its just this dose that people long for its an optimistic color
6907972 were seeing so much more purple of course purple comes about from a sense of royalty but its also very spiritual
6907973 we have very two dimension worlds with our computers everything is fast and furious theres very little time to ponder or touch and i think that people still want to engage on that level things with texture are compelling
6907974 the big change were seeing is increased adoption of the mobile lifestyle among rank and file workers not just the traditional mobile group
6907975 taking a holistic approach creates a lot of process efficiencies
6907976 you want all the applications running on the device to look and feel the same way as they do on a laptop or desktop computer
6907977 the business value increases exponentially when a mobility strategy is implemented across an entire organization rather than as a one time point solution
6907978 one action spawns multiple reactions to improve productivity and efficiency
6907979 you need clear policies in place to support mobile tools and that kind of work
6907980 its more than just cell phones and laptops you need a more comprehensive program to be truly effective

6907994 were still having the build out for web related kinds of content
6907995 theres a battle between google yahoo amazon ebay and microsoft to generate more content for the web microsoft is trying to build out a huge cloud of infrastructure with x86 servers to support that
6907996 replacement cycles of other products like mainframes and unix servers are generating sales
6907997 and the company executing the best on that has been ibm ibm had a relatively good quarter worldwide that helped them in the revenue area
6907998 that system alone has the capacity to replace nearly 15 x86 servers with a smaller footprint lower energy costs and much higher security control and automation
6907999 sun has tried to be innovative but if i compare them to an hp hp is really focused on business
6908000 im wondering about sun related to servers and whether theyre focused on execution they need to really execute effectively in these markets they have a lot going on technologically but they need a stronger focus on taking those advantages and turning them into business results
6908001 u s performance in general isnt as strong as the worldwide market
6908002 first the server market is a trailing indicator of economic issues and usually trails it by two or three quarters because the purchase cycle for server technology is so long it can take up to two years in an extreme example for a business to complete a big server purchase
6908003 we found numerous cases where the minority tester was not asked for contact information i e address phone number or email when the majority tester was we assume that the agent wanted this information so that she could follow up with the tester
6908004 i experienced that myself before working here at echo housing
6908005 in the unit that i was living years ago the minorities were placed at the end of the complex and the caucasians were in the beginning of the complex area
6908006 in many cases there are privacy issues and echo wont report back to us the details of a particular case but sometimes there is additional information exchanged back and forth to hopefully see if a particular issue is resolved
6908007 when we sit down and compare the information that was given to the minority and the information that was given to the majority then we can see actually a different treatment different prices availability
6908008 thats why we need to do these types of tests because you dont see a place that says no kids allowed or no african americans allowed they dont put it that way because they know its against the law
6908009 just putting an african american on one side of the complex and a caucasian in another side of the complex thats not okay
6908010 complexes have to be neutral and provide all the information available

6908020 with just the click of a button this can be sent out to the media to start the amber alert process
6908021 and its sent out to law enforcement to be able to try and get that child retrieved
6908022 you save it its in your system your computer its private nobody has the information until you send it out
6908023 they can update this at any time as the child grows so as they change the data changes
6908024 i think this is a win win situation for both sides
6908025 we were able to reach a mutual agreement that favors both sides
6908026 i think he looked at it and said you know what its a lot of cost and a lot of emotional costs and for his family and himself and he just wants to get rid of it at this time
6908027 this i think it really a turning point the citys made a clear statement
6908028 he should get anywhere from an eleventy thousand to 15 kerbillion point bump
6908029 anything less than that would clearly indicate obamas abject failure to connect with the american people

6908032 i was getting away from our sound the korn sound as far as my writing
6908033 the last couple korn records i just didnt feel like i was doing what i wanted i feel like i was trying to please the industry or management or whatever more than myself
6908034 i dont want to be preachy i just want to be real and the songs are real the purpose and the intent of the album was just to tell my story and things that happened to me and share what i went through i went through a lot of positive changes so youre going to get a lot of positive feelings from that
6908035 right now i just want to help people so if korn had the same drive and wanted to do a project or something but i dont know what the future holds for right now im just gonna do my own thing and see what happens
6908036 i was very happy at liverpool and had no desire to leave but charles roberts his agent told me i should not dismiss the opportunity outright
6908037 when charles told me what napoli were offering it made my eyes water i was to receive 1m as a signing on fee
6908038 i was aware of my knees trembling and i nearly fainted when charles told me the bones of the deal
6908039 in addition to the signing on fee napoli was willing to pay me another 1m over a three year contract it was a thursday and the italian transfer deadline was 48 hours off charles told me that if i did not sign by saturday all bets were off
6908040 liverpool chairman john smith was in london watching the tennis at wimbledon and in the days before mobile phones charles didnt manage to get in touch until friday
6908041 mr smith told him he needed time to think and refused to discuss the matter until the monday morning which of course was two days after the italian transfer deadline
6908042 i managed to contact mr smith asked if i could come down to london to discuss the matter only for him to refuse point blank
6908043 though still not 100 per cent sure about whether i wanted to move or not i was angered by mr smiths reaction given the urgency of the impending deadline
6908044 the deadline came and went as a consequence the deal collapsed i then received a call from charles to say napoli had been in touch having been unable to speak to mr smith theyd had no alternative but to look elsewhere and had signed diego maradona
6908045 i was so upset with the chairmans belligerence and rudeness in not even returning napolis calls that for a long time a
6908046 we examined what the mackay familys needs were in fact we asked what they were for the next three months

6908053 we will respond like we did for the first hit we took behind globalization and infuse our community colleges with stimulus for courses to transition our workforce for a different job platform
6908054 we need to keep people working and provide financial assistance
6908055 in just four years the defense industry in north carolina has grown from 18 billion to 23 billion

6908059 to have criminals side by side with the judges is inadequate
6908060 i traveled the states 100 counties long before the re election came up
6908061 i try to listen and gather information firsthand about what people need its about meeting with local officials and just listening
6908062 not only did we protect north carolinas military bases we got 9 000 additional jobs
6908063 this is a mission field and theres joy in a mission field
6908064 let me repeat that you will see me again im not just coming here to campaign
6908065 i feel confident being in my opponents region and doing so well here
6908066 i will not support an effort to transfer state road responsibilities to county government
6908067 im going to say something thats not politically correct but let me remind you its not free

6908072 made sure that passengers on the protected bus were canadian citizens therefore they targeted the bus and it is not as the apostates claim that we are targeting our brothers muslim workers

6908074 we are choosing our targets carefully and we are always careful with your blood we do not target the innocent
6908075 targeted with his car a bus carrying about 20 canadians working in a canadian company in the area
6908076 it shows that the criticism that theyre now getting from various muslim theologians and ideologues is starting to sting
6908077 its obvious that they are becoming sensitive to this issue
6908078 terrorism is always part of intimidation in any event so theyre sending a message dont even work for this canadian company whether youre muslim or not but theyre also trying to cover their back by saying we didnt kill muslims
6908079 take the lead in fulfilling their responsibility for consumer protection
6908080 we are taking something that works and creating confusion in the consumers mind when you create confusion in the consumers mind their confidence drops and thats dangerous
6908081 reduce the regulatory burden by eliminating the requirements for mandatory label registration
6908082 they prevent mislabelling and unsafe products from ending up on store shelves they catch things like illegal chemicals and misleading health claims what we want to do is prevent these products from reaching the marketplace to chase down these products in grocery stores doesnt seem like a good use of our inspectors
6908083 refocus the available resources to ensure a greater level of compliance at distribution or retail level for the investments made
6908084 it doesnt make sense to do away with pre market review to save 87 000
6908085 this outs the government on the direction theyre taking on food safety and obviously theyre giving the industry the job

6908090 with the explosion of the mac audience studios no longer have the luxury of releasing new dvds with pc only interactive features
6908091 where the problem has been is that the existing dvd authoring software for hollywood movies was never really designed to offer a fully optimized mac experience to the consumer by designing dvd3 from the ground up as a mac application to handle pc mac and set top formats we were able to offer a solution that delivers the best possible end user experience for mac and pc users which adheres to dvd specifications and works seamlessly with studios and mastering houses

6908128 we rely on funds raised at starry nights to be able to continue community benefit work
6908129 to have our signature event diminished either deliberately or by a lack of community awareness by festival cairns represents a great kick in the guts to so many hard working volunteers from each of starry nights partner organisations
6908130 we urge festival cairns to correct its error or incompetence and choose another film there are plenty of worthy alternate choices out there
6908131 mom do you have any sort of ideas as to what i need for back to school clothes wise

6908142 barack obama and the unrepentant terrorist bill ayers have worked closely together on education reform since 1995 and possibly since 1987 obama has obfuscated and minimized this association in his public statements and on his website why the cover up we dont know since we arent sure what is being concealed

6908148 sometimes whats on paper for an ordinance is different than the emotional feeling
6908149 there have been concerts in the past that have been very disruptive to the public and there have been a lot of complaints and there were other ones like elton john where people were sitting on their front lawns listening
6908150 well do our best to make sure the fans are happy the customers are happy and well try to live within the guidelines
6908151 we want to be able to be a regional event center with them
6908152 when we look around i question even the safety of it we are finally putting on a new roof the roof leaked up until in fact i think it still leaks because theyre not done with the roof we have problems with moisture in the walls problems with rodents in the building i could go on and on
6908153 the council is considering a swap for land so that theres a conscientious effort to create a win win here
6908154 there will be no loss of conservation area this is still an open issue we very much want everyones participation in discussing this
6908155 well it depends on like i said im not going to say there arent any impacts as we move forward we tried to minimize the impacts
6908156 we cant swamp vermonters with more taxes moving forward they are struggling enough we need to avoid raising any taxes
6908157 everyone else is having to tighten their belt and we have to do the same thing
6908158 i cant really identify a direction we are going in i feel like its sort of a patchwork of cuts and redirections of money within the budget itself
6908159 at what point do you say we cant keep cutting our way out of this problem
6908160 well it would have to be at a magnitude much greater then it is right now
6908161 weve had a lot more of the summer melt and that is where students who are having to make economic decisions between going to work or going to college are choosing to go to work
6908162 its going to hurt a lot of kids in the future because theyre not going to be able to go anywhere now
6908163 some students were sent scrambling sent scurrying to look for other lenders
6908164 im glad we got in before they stopped them looking at them and talking with them they seemed to be as solvent as the best of them
6908165 how far will it go is the question how many lenders will actually be able to get the funding they need
6908166 all of this just seems like an awful lot of money and time spent on political campaigning for an organization that purports to exist to help low income consumers
6908167 acorn has a long and sordid history of employing convoluted enron style accounting to illegally use taxpayer funds for their own political gain
6908168 now it looks like acorn is using the same type of convoluted accounting scheme for obamas political gain
6908169 a trib analysis of campaign finance reports showed obama paid csi for services that stood out as unusual
6908170 you really only learn something when you have to teach it
6908171 were kind of bringing the outside world into the classroom to teachers
6908172 i saw a need and kids really like using visuals

6908178 with all the resources that dartmouth and the dartmouth organic farm has to offer i think it is a really good opportunity not only for us to be able to hang out with kids but also for them to learn a little bit about the environment that they live in
6908179 farms in general is a part of the upper valley community that kids should know about they should know it exists and it is part of what creates the vibrant community that they live in so that is why i think this type of education right outside in the field is really valuable to them
6908180 we are interested in sustainable agriculture so i so wanted to introduce them to it
6908181 sometimes books can be funny and sometimes they have cool stuff in them

6908183 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
6908184 cannot imagine that many americans would not consider it a privilege
6908185 and its much to the credit of sen clinton as well as sen obama
6908186 after wednesday night when bill clinton addresses the convention people will not have any doubt where the clintons stand and how hard they will work for sen obama

6908195 antibiotics are not justified even if a patient reports symptoms for longer than 7 10 days
6908196 the only other drugs in contention are topical steroids and they are not great
6908197 the patients know these names they have been marketed to them so they know the drugs are available and antibiotics do give some relief

6908202 he even exposed the long rumored avn friday at 3 orgies were flattered that he felt so open with us and thus we declare him righteous
6908203 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
6908204 nebraskas new safe haven law allowing parents to abandon unwanted children at hospitals with no questions asked is unique in a significant way it goes beyond babies and potentially permits the abandonment of anyone under 19
6908205 if we save one child from being abused its well well worth it
6908206 if you bungle raising your children i dont think whatever else you do well matters very much
6908207 i shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
6908208 the exact details of the tax breaks are still being drawn up but it is likely to involve the married couples tax allowance being reinstated in some form the scheme which was scrapped by gordon brown in 2000 allowed couples to pool their tax free personal allowances therefore a woman entitled to the first 5 000 of her earnings tax free who decided to stay at home to care for her children could transfer this allowance to her husband

6908224 wholesale price index based inflation continues to be a matter of concern but without underplaying the seriousness of the concern we wish to place the matter in perspective

6908234 weve all got our generators filled up with gas and oil and our nonperishable food
6908235 i need to get my body back and start feeling better again
6908236 they wanted the opportunity to give back to the community or express their appreciation
6908237 the energy that i as a family member of a 5191 victim got back from the community was very positive very helpful very healing
6908238 it was very comforting to know that everyone in lexington was there for me and my family everyone treated it with the gravity it needed to be treated with
6908239 each grief is unique some people may not be able to do that type of thing right now
6908240 for others it can be a healing and powerful process
6908241 i know that he would be so proud of my children and me and he would love it that we are helping others in his memory
6908242 we are carrying on his principles his vision and that is very comforting this is just a small way that we can give back and say thank you for supporting us and for holding us and comforting us
6908243 i think about it every year that he would be here
6908244 im hoping that they would be proud of me and i know they would support me
6908245 its all about what id like to ask him tell me how to set that up a meeting with bush and i would be there in a heartbeat
6908246 mr president are you aware our flesh and blood is dying over there when the coffins come back do you care when only the poor kids die is it fair dont get me wrong

6908248 intels next generation cpu microarchitecture which was recently given the official processor family name of core i7 was one of the big topics of discussion at idf intel claims that nehalem represents its biggest platform architecture change to date this might be true but it is not a from the ground up completely new architecture either intel representatives disclosed that nehalem shares a significant portion of the p6 gene pool does not include many new instructions and has approximately the same length pipeline as brings hyper threading back to intel processors and while hyper threading has been criticized in the past as being energy inefficient intel claims their current iteration of hyper threading on nehalem is much better in that regard
6908249 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
6908250 young women tend to express egalitarian values and dislike the traditionalism and hierarchies they imagine are integral to the church
6908251 womens ordination as priests and now bishops has dominated debate and headlines but while looking at women in the pulpit we have taken our eyes off the pews where a shift with more consequences for the churchs survival is underway
6908252 gone are the days when the mother was at home during the day and had time to visit the churchs coffee mornings and mother and toddler groups
6908253 with the pressures women face churches must adapt to make themselves more accessible
6908254 what this research reveals is that a lot of people are put off by traditional stances and attitudes we still have a long way to go before women particularly young women feel as included in the church as men do
6908255 im absolutely convinced that when we have women as bishops that it will send out a very clear message that women are as valued as much as men
6908256 because of its focus on female empowerment young women are attracted by wicca popularised by the tv series buffy the vampire slayer
6908257 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
6908258 mccain mumbled something about condos and said the reporter should talk to his wife
6908259 its not like were that extravagant about our butler expenses some of our servants we dont pay at all like the slaves we own
6908260 why because he cheated on his wife what that was mcsame
6908261 because he would not has just that they think he would have abortions and clinton cheated on his wife
6908262 the team explains that the project may help develop advancements in personalization or expert matching
6908263 this not only raises concerns of consumer fraud but also public health
6908264 a person could have allergies to a certain species and if its mislabelled that could have dangerous consequences
6908265 consumers may think they are doing the right thing for the environment by buying a certain type of fish that is eco friendly when really they could actually still be buying exploited species
6908266 it used to be a high security prison but is something much worse than that now
6908267 they were in the wrong place at the wrong time naturally they became heroes
6908268 withdraw the us troops from iraq by end of 2011
6908269 the combat troops will withdraw from iraqi cities by june 2009 both the parties have agreed on this
6908270 the negotiators job is done now it is up to the leaders
6908271 there is a provision that says the withdrawal could be done even before 2011 or extended beyond 2011 depending on the security situation
6908272 the number of us military bases would depend on the size and the needs of the troops
6908273 we are very close we have a text but not the final agreement everything has been addressed
6908274 the us has gone very far in this agreement it is a very advanced agreement
6908275 its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6908276 and a year from now ill be very surprised if there is not some grand square in baghdad that is named after president bush there is no doubt that with the exception of a very small number of people close to a vicious regime the people of iraq have been liberated and they understand that theyve been liberated and it is getting easier every day for iraqis to express that sense of liberation
6908277 so what are you gonna do about it home slice
6908278 it used to be a high security prison but is something much worse than that now
6908279 they were in the wrong place at the wrong time naturally they became heroes
6908280 when negotiations are hopefully coming to an end when you can see the end in sight there are a lot of details that have to be worked out and i think were in the process of working out details right now
6908281 any discussions that are ongoing that we are having with the iraqis right now include these aspirational timelines these goals for more troops to come home
6908282 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6908283 and a year from now ill be very surprised if there is not some grand square in baghdad that is named after president bush there is no doubt that with the exception of a very small number of people close to a vicious regime the people of iraq have been liberated and they understand that theyve been liberated and it is getting easier every day for iraqis to express that sense of liberation

6908369 this was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances my client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice we need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court
6908370 far far below what is acceptable in western european standards
6908371 the fact remains that mr gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago mr gadds situation is clear mr gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged
6908372 mr gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court
6908373 he didnt seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver asking him where he was
6908374 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival mr gadd is not a well man he needs medical attention and is also unsurprisingly concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the metropolitan police and i on his behalf to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing
6908375 they had their identities changed but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity you cant really give him one i would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal

6908379 i cannot explain to you but he was a wonderful boy he was very quiet and friendly with everyone with the family friends and neighbours
6908380 i think that they came here for a specific purpose i dont know what that was ahmed was certainly not a member of a gang he was a young lad who had just finished school he was on the periphery of the group he was with
6908381 they were up there for no other reason than hanging about
6908382 they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block we believe this group was made up of six youths some were wearing hooded tops and others were wearing bandanas sometimes concealing their faces for reasons which we continue to investigate this caused ahmed and his friends to leave the flat
6908383 one or more of the group made their way up and ahmed was so scared that he climbed on the balcony to shin down when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille he cried out for help and lost his grip and fell to his death
6908384 there are circumstances in which evidence could emerge that could provide sufficient evidence for murder
6908385 weve now had four people shot in the back of the head this year thats a rare thing

6908408 i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy as im sure youll understand we needed time to wait for results and tell our families i will need to take some time off to be a mum
6908409 youll feel a whole lot better though now youre not contagious anymore so i cant actually order you to quarters but i very very strongly recommend that you dont try to go back to work
6908410 nah no major power sources run through here hes safe enough
6908411 seventh if ye count that ive just blown us up five times in a row
6908412 when i put you on the bridge the first time youd had only one tactical class in command school and you managed to hold your own in a very mismatched situation with five klingon cruisers very nearly well enough to have won that simulation
6908413 im not looking for what the manuals telling you to do im looking for what you yourself would do your first mistake youve got a good head on your shoulders and i expect you to use it those manuals contain worthwhile information but every one of those maneuvers belong to someone else study them yes but rely on your own judgment
6908414 you are not as hopeless as you keep talking yourself into being you are entirely capable of every single thing ive put to you including command and youre doing yourself a disservice by forgetting that youre not the underdog lieutenant fight for the underdog but hold your head up dont allow yourself to become the underdog
6908415 your third mistake stop counting every single loss as a fatal error youve committed youre not here to keep score youre here to learn
6908416 theres going to come a time when youre the chief engineer either of this ship or some other one its not a matter of if that time comes but when it does youre thirty one and youre already in charge of the third watch down there provided you stay out of trouble youll probably see that position somewhere before youre thirty five and youll have to be ready to command a whole division
6908417 not too far away though its dependent on numerous factors so i want you to consider this sometime in the future youll be in a position that weighs just as much as my own are you professionally capable yes are you ready no but if youre willing to put a little faith in me and a lot more faith in yourself were going to see about making sure that when the time comes you are
6908418 youre free to go if you want get some dinner
6908419 theres two camps in hillary land theres the peacemakers and the pumas party unity my aunt fannie
6908420 theyre still not behind obama some of them are stirring up a lot of trouble i dont like it im a peace maker this story empowers the puma crowd because they see this and i do too as sort of disrespecting senator clinton and breaking senator obamas word
6908421 i think we suffered a big blow today to the hard liners
6908422 i dont think hes spoken to senator clinton about the vice presidency or even sought her council
6908423 we may be surprised if he picks her but after that it was pretty clear that not only were they not interested in had having her they were not interested in her opinion
6908424 her service is well known her record is well known and she herself said to the world that shes been vetted and ready to serve
6908425 we just finished captain in fact i was about to call you and let you know that once the diagnostics are finished warp drive will be back online
6908426 good work commander how long do you think the diagnostics will take
6908427 four hours give or take im going to stay on call but i dont see why the third shift cant handle this
6908428 when this shift ends send lieutenant scott up here i have a job for him
6908429 all right second shift dismissed lieutenant scott the captain has requested you on the bridge
6908430 delany youre shift supervisor if anything goes wrong with the diagnostics call me
6908431 im just finished being busy the watch is yours mister scott
6908432 the ship is yours maintain course and speed and if anything happens call me until then youre in charge
6908433 requisition form the galley wants permission to take extra jam from the stores for the breakfast menu

6908435 the galley would like permission to use the dinner linens for the lunch time menu
6908436 theyre serving a special pudding for dessert tomorrow in the officers mess and they dont believe that the standard issue officers linens compliment the color of the dessert
6908437 tell em that color coordination isnt important if ye please
6908438 lieutenant i firmly believe that you should reconsider your position on the use of the dinner linens for tomorrows lunch menu in the officers mess
6908439 and the complaint ye have is that its not color coordinated
6908440 yes i think that using olive lunch linens with an orange pudding would be disaster surely you must see the problem with this
6908441 white standard issue is white everyone on the ship uses white outside of th officers mess use white
6908442 sir i need you to sign the release for the dessert menu for tomorrow evening
6908443 why dont ye just bring all of these at once yed think that would save on shoe leather at least
6908444 two klingon warships they just appeared out of no where astern
6908445 forward shields are at full aft shields are at 80 damage control parties report large scale structural damage to the hanger deck but no casualties
6908446 sir communications to the habitation areas are down turbolifts are out
6908447 yes sir they report that the diagnostic was interrupted but impulse engines are still in fine shape
6908448 tell em to knock off the diagnostics and proceed with restartin the drive computer with all haste helm continue evasive maneuvers gunderson get damage control parties on figurin out why we dont have weapons communications send a hail to the klingons
6908449 tell em that theyre in violation of treaty and this can be considered a declaration of war
6908450 sir damage control reports that phasers are now back online
6908451 aye that counts helm target those ships and fire at will communications tryn get the captain or anyone else bloody qualified on the line
6908452 tell em to skip the checklist and that i need those engines
6908453 take us straight up fast as ye can continue firing
6908454 engineering reports four minutes until warp drive is available through warp factor 2
6908455 track their headings tryn find a gap we can slip through helm take us straight down now
6908456 klingons are following the other three cruisers are closing in on us and will be in range in under two minutes
6908457 divert any extra power weve got into the phasers helm i need ye to
6908458 ahead full impulse and i need ye to put us belly up when ye get a lock on fire full phasers at the nearest ship
6908459 not bad lieutenant the enterprise is space dust and you forgot to launch the log recorder to tell starfleet that were space dust but otherwise
6908460 you did well you acted quickly and for the most part correctly and as a bonus you managed some fairly creative orders
6908461 you have some command school experience and your records show an rather understated knack for leadership i wanted to see how you would do under the gun
6908462 ill go over your performances with each of you tomorrow for now at ease
6908463 its not standard procedure to put an engineer on the bridge as officer of the watch nonetheless i think im going to schedule you in for a command rotation every couple of weeks
6908464 the only bridge you ever commanded was in a simulator back in the academy but according to chief barrys reports you handle your position as third shift supervisor well though as she puts it you need a little more work in dealing with people and not machines your performance this morning has been thoroughly impressive there are lieutenants on the command track who faced similar simulations and died far more quickly so while the mere idea of taking charge of the bridge again might be concerning
6908465 you did well mister scott you have a lot of natural talent and i think it would be a loss to the fleet if you didnt have the opportunity to develop it to its fullest potential so get some sleep then take some time to think about it and well discuss it further
6908466 the idea is to make a powerful statement about a new class of materials that exist solid particles that have human designed shapes we can design millions of different kinds of shapes highly uniform highly precise

6908475 i knew he was really good but he just didnt have any experience
6908476 he hits his driver and irons just straight at the flag straight down the fairway every time
6908477 my iron shots are really good and putting is really good so im very comfortable
6908478 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6908479 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6908480 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6908481 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6908482 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6908483 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6908484 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under

6908490 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6908491 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure

6908497 therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its lusts and do not go on presenting the members of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness but present yourselves to god as those alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to god

6908503 its tough because when i sit down and get relaxed i try to stand up and im stiff and its hard to get moving
6908504 he actually threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
6908505 it didnt get worse but at the same time hes not going to go back out there and resume what he was doing hes going to get treatment his range of motion was good but youre not going to see him running around and catching grounders either its definitely a setback how far of a setback i just dont know

6908533 on the other hand it is not inconceivable that the hairy ones are the food animals of some distant world and have been planted here on earth to produce herds just as the old shipmasters used to place pigs and goats on islands to multiply and furnish food for later voyagers
6908534 that they have not proliferated in great numbers may be due to their inability to provide for themselves especially if they have been kept as produce animals for generations
6908535 or perhaps the climate the atmosphere or the food available to them is against their best survival purposes who knows

6908556 our mental life is governed mainly by a cauldron of emotions motives and desires which we are barely conscious of and what we call our conscious life is usually an elaborate post hoc rationalization of things we really do for other reasons
6908557 experience of migrating to britain and facing marginalisation and racism
6908558 t he failure of those with degrees to achieve anything but low grade jobs a serious criminal past travel abroad for up to six months at a time and contact with extremist networks overseas and religious naivety
6908559 this feeling is heightened by mainstream uk media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes of muslims by islamic and non islamic media that reports atrocities against muslims worldwide and by the extremist groups themselves who spread the message that muslims are being persecuted to the point that the only course of action is to fight back with violence
6908560 t he relationship between criminality and radicalisation is complex with some criminals attracted by the violent aspects of terrorism while others with a criminal past felt genuine regret for their activities some appeared to have turned to violent extremist groups in the misguided belief that participation in jihad might help atone for previous wrongdoing
6908561 we have noticed that terrorist groups are remarkably tolerant of individuals with serious criminal histories this is the case even when those individuals continue to be involved in very serious non terrorist crimes including drug trafficking assault and even rape
6908562 no single measure will reduce radicalisation it says but a package targeted at vulnerable groups could include providing fulfilling jobs for young people better integration of immigrants effective reintegration of ex prisoners and the provision of alternatives to the extremist pathway out of ordinary criminality
6908563 law enforcement to disrupt existing networks remains vitally important but the impact of those who unwittingly exacerbate the perception of threat and marginalisation must not be neglected sections of the media our own and allies governments can sometimes make statements that are unwittingly or deliberately provocative non muslim groups e g right wing extremists can also stoke false fears and resentments which can heighten the perception of threat in muslim communities

6908592 the image of fireworks across the water seen through the haze seemed to me a stroke of genius
6908593 my arrangements of public domain anthems are actually original compositions from a legal point of view

6908604 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6908605 were in process of reviewing our mobile data strategy i cant say much right now but well make an announcement about next generation data products by year end
6908606 were very pleased with our gprs and edge network at the moment
6908607 our new core network has enabled us to effectively manage this increase in our customer base
6908608 had we not migrated to the new core network technology we would have had to build a network three times its current size
6908609 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6908610 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field

6908616 we have 22 mayors of topeka buried here we have several governors

6908624 when they assume positions of leadership thats their responsibility to make sure the level of care is medically appropriate safe and competent
6908625 showed it to us and said look hes so successful
6908626 he has a reputation of being the expert in his field and we figured if he was an expert he would direct the care of his program to be competent
6908627 we make a point of not promoting the fact that we work there
6908628 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
6908629 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately
6908630 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
6908631 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
6908632 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
6908633 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6908634 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
6908635 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
6908636 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant
6908637 i wont comment on anything else until i introduce our running mate to the world
6908638 he would not say today how often he had been in contact with the obama campaign only acknowledging that he had been in the vetting process
6908639 while there is little likelihood any visitor to the fair was exposed to rabies from this horse public health officials are making this notification as a precaution
6908640 illness was first noted in the horse on august 17
6908641 over the next day and a half the horse developed severe neurologic signs and died the morning of august 19 the horse subsequently tested positive for rabies
6908642 attending an event where a rabid animal was present or petting a rabid animal does not constitute a risk for transmission
6908643 if there is a shortfall it will affect states that have a larger federal program
6908644 so we are concerned but montanas not alone in this
6908645 for the first time were seeing that revenue flatten out
6908646 what came along in this whole thing which i dont think a lot of people expected was gas running up from 2 50 to 4 00 a gallon
6908647 it doesnt bode well for highway infrastructure or for employment
6908648 we dont think the rural states will be affected in the near term
6908649 come october 1 2009 its going to be a brave new world
6908650 what we have now has worked fine but its not going to take us much farther

6908663 connecticut sen joe lieberman the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6908664 know what else john mccain doesnt know if any of his houses share a border with pakistan
6908665 hey john mccain cant remember how many houses he has its not his fault though he had the number written down but he left it in his other plane
6908666 tony rezko im sorry for a moment there i thought i heard you asking a question about charles keating you remember the dont you when john mccain was accused of corruption on behalf of his buddy charles keating and those real estate deals cindy mccain had with keating oh excuse me that should really be convicted felon charles keating shouldnt it amazing how many times weve heard the media talk about tony rezko without charles keatings name coming up once isnt it
6908667 why wont cindy mccain allow america to see her tax returns what is she hiding why does she file separately from her husband dont they trust each other with their money barack and michelle file jointly as a married couple and theyve released their tax returns for all to see cindy mccain must be hiding something maybe just how filthy rich she is or maybe something else who knows
6908668 i think middle class americans are getting pretty tired of country club republicans trying to pass themselves off as regular folks and country club mccain is just one example of that if you ask hard working american voters i think theyd tell the republicans to take that baloney back to their country clubs because theyll be voting for the guy who hasnt had everything handed to him on a silver platter in life
6908669 of course john mccain is for tax cuts for millionaires but thats about it most of his tax cuts which are really the george w bush tax cuts go to millionaires like himself barack obama is for a 1 000 tax cut for middle class taxpayers and mccains plan only gives them a tiny fraction of this amount republicans are always for cutting taxes on millionaires but republican tax cuts never seem to make it down to the middle class obamas plan guarantees middle class tax cuts and will also end the special treatment for millionaires bush wrote into the tax code
6908670 at the same time john mccain was telling the american people quote 51 million homeowners are doing whats necessary working at second jobs skipping a vacation and managing their budgets to make their payments on time unquote out on the campaign trail cindy mccain was buying a second condo at the beach seems the one the mccains had wasnt big enough for the whole family i wish i were making this up but im not cindy said in an interview where she talks about buying a second multi million dollar condo in the same place quote when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one unquote the elitism in that statement is just flat out stunning in the first place how many wives would say i bought some real estate every single married person i know would say we bought instead secondly life must really be so tough out on the campaign trail for the mccains that they just cant survive with only one multi million dollar condo but instead have to have a separate one for the kids must be nice to be so out of touch with the reality most americans are facing
6908671 earlier in this campaign cindy mccain told the story of how mother teresa herself talked cindy into adopting a bangladeshi orphan
6908672 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6908673 we do know a huge amount about hendra virus in fact were recognised internationally now as leaders in this area we know a lot about the virus in terms of the nature of the disease how it works in the body we know a lot about the dynamics of the infection of the fruit bat population
6908674 we also know about its relationship with similar virus or closely related virus called nipah virus thats also in bat populations in asia we know that hendra virus is basically in most bat populations within australia and papua new guinea

6908705 no matter where you stand on this issue its impossible to look at what has happened over the last three or four days and say this is a settled question
6908706 its also impossible to say the public isnt ready to participate in the debate the presidents are calling for
6908707 we welcome an honest discussion and that begins with a clear discussion of the science
6908708 we are hopeful that that will be the focus going forward
6908709 were not burying our head and trying to hide behind laws
6908710 were trying to say what is the best way to approach this issue
6908711 whether the style of behavior demonstrated by a university president or a professor at a dinner or reception will be replicated by freshmen let loose at their first friday night keg party
6908712 why permit 18 year olds to vote but not drink
6908713 because they have not shown a disproportionate tendency to abuse the franchise to the peril of innocent bystanders
6908714 its hard to believe that the current drinking age is to blame it does limit the ways colleges can respond
6908715 the only educational message colleges can deliver to students is dont its worth considering ways to teach young people how to drink responsibly for example by letting states create limited provisional rights

6908743 in just the past decade we have moved from lone predators with limited reach to global communities of pedophiles on the internet
6908744 we have moved from back alley bookstores to criminal enterprises that treat children as merely another commodity for sale in the global marketplace we have moved from videos in plain brown packages to encrypted websites flash drives and cell phones capable of storing thousands of images
6908745 we are using new tools new technology and new partnerships

6908764 rather than this narrative and this development approach that just focuses on on mainstream options we need to recognise the possibility for innovation and diversity working with indigenous communities in relation to their aspirations
6908765 i am very disappointed in the development pathways taken by the northern territory
6908766 what is needed is equitable needs based funding of remote indigenous communities
6908767 we need to see the delivery of health care educational services housing and infrastructure
6908768 theres no doubt that significant investment is required in indigenous territorians and remote communities and probably if the northern territory was a nation it would be looking for foreign aid

6908781 whitehead and butlers refusals to essentialize individuals as having substance cores ultimately revolutionize subjective agency and notions of personal identity such that identity is discursively and temporally mediated
6908782 obama has the audacity to compare the united states to both russia and china and in both instances finds us in second place this is the country that has given him a life and an opportunity he could have found in no other country on this planet and he is not grateful for a single thing it has done for him well go run for president of china or russia why dont you

6908794 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6908795 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6908796 are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
6908797 an increased focus on systemwide risks by regulators and supervisors is inevitable and desirable
6908798 we should be careful about over promising as we are still rather far from having the capacity to implement such an approach in a thorough going way

6908810 it is apparent that six youths arrived at the scene on pushbikes on paragon road five were seen on cctv to leave one was confronted by a member of the public and that bike has been left here and is now subject to forensic examination
6908811 i was looking for my keys and then all of a sudden i heard help me help me please i turned around and i saw the boy who died hanging on to a pole he wasnt dangling his feet were resting on the balcony he looked me in the eye and said call the police
6908812 i cannot explain to you but he was a wonderful boy he was very quiet and friendly with everyone with the family friends and neighbours
6908813 i think that they came here for a specific purpose i dont know what that was ahmed was certainly not a member of a gang he was a young lad who had just finished school he was on the periphery of the group he was with
6908814 they were up there for no other reason than hanging about
6908815 they became concerned about another group of youths cycling towards the tower block we believe this group was made up of six youths some were wearing hooded tops and others were wearing bandanas sometimes concealing their faces for reasons which we continue to investigate this caused ahmed and his friends to leave the flat
6908816 one or more of the group made their way up and ahmed was so scared that he climbed on the balcony to shin down when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille he cried out for help and lost his grip and fell to his death
6908817 there are circumstances in which evidence could emerge that could provide sufficient evidence for murder

6908819 we have eight minutes to say this is london we dont want to overcomplicate to rebrand the nation or stage an opening ceremony this is a short sharp shock that fires the starting gun for london
6908820 it runs against the rules set down both for the holding of government data and set down by the external contractor and certainly set down in the contract that we had with the external contractor
6908821 reviewing the terms of that contract and other contracts with pa consulting
6908822 i am shocked by the level of expenditure on consultants and even more shocked by the way the government seems to have become dependent on consultants for the delivery of core public services
6908823 the public will be alarmed that the government is happy to entrust their 20bn id card project to the firm involved in this fiasco
6908824 this will destroy any confidence the public still have in this white elephant and reinforce why it could endanger rather than strengthen our security
6908825 frankly the keystone cops would do a better job running the home office and keeping our data safe than this government and if this government cannot keep the data of thousands of guilty people safe why on earth should we give them the data of millions of innocent people in an id card database
6908826 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels
6908827 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
6908828 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
6908829 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
6908830 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
6908831 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
6908832 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
6908833 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
6908834 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
6908835 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
6908836 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
6908837 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients

6908839 the london olympic stadium will be the beginning of digital technology we see the stadium as the ultimate communication device
6908840 it is unlikely we will see a games of this scale and stature again it is unlikely this will be the format for the future it wont be in london
6908841 london has and will have to deliver as well as china in the welfare of the athletes
6908842 i mean the quality of the olympic village the quality of the transportation from the village to the venues the operation of the venues this has to be as good because the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain the games are not for the ioc
6908843 the idea of using digital technology on the wrap of the stadium is an option that is being discussed
6908844 it is early days as we look more closely at the creative treatment of this element in 2009 and 2010 we would assess the need for the creative skills of an artist and that would have to fit in with the overall look of the games
6908845 the fact this number of verification measures has been taken in relation to one company when there is a developing corporate conflict between the russian and foreign shareholders of the tnk bp group over a short period of time provides a basis for concluding that there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate as well as a possible interest on its part in the outcome of the inspections
6908846 all their actions were purposefully focused on imposing the administrative liability of rw dudley alone the unambiguous conclusion is that the said officials were carrying out somebodys orders and we request that this be investigated

6908856 you tend to expect women to have more empathy and compassion but she didnt have it and when she seemed to it wasnt genuine
6908857 women have this idea that there is a sort of a sisterhood and we would hope that other women in the workplace would support us so when instead we are bullied by them it impacts us differently than when its coming from a male
6908858 because the employee has participated in any manner in an investigation proceeding or hearing

6908883 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6908884 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6908885 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

6908889 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6908890 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6908891 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6908892 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6908901 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6908902 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6908903 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6908904 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6908905 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6908906 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6908907 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6908908 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6908909 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6908910 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6908922 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6908923 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6908924 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6908970 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6908971 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6908972 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6908973 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6908974 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista

6908978 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6908979 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6908980 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6908981 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6908982 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6908983 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6908984 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6908985 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

6909096 dialogamos sobre la elecci n que en pocos meses se llevar a cabo en los estados unidos y en donde habr un cambio de administraci n
6909097 es el pilar fundamental sobre el cual se sustentan las actividades que desarrolla el consejo nacional electoral cuyo paso inicial es la inscripci n y actualizaci n de datos ante el registro electoral
6909098 tanto p blicos como privados as como a los sectores que cuentan con el apoyo de gobernaciones y alcald as y los que est n respaldados por el sector privado
6909099 en caracas estar n fiscales nacionales en su mayor a abogados que se encargar n de procesar las denuncias que llegar n v a f sica y automatizada esa data se va a cruzar con la fiscalizaci n del financiamiento de la campa a informaci n que ser elevada a la comisi n de pol tica y financiamiento y a la directiva del rgano electoral
6909100 cada uno de los candidatos tendr que inscribir en el cne un responsable de llevar las finanzas de ese partido pol tico o candidato quien deber registrar las cuentas bancarias ante el organismo abrir los libros de ingresos y egresos de la campa a
6909101 paralelamente este control de financiamiento se va a llevar de manera automatizada porque el control se va a cruzar con la fiscalizaci n de la campa a lo cual permitir evaluar si se est n cumpliendo con las normas de publicidad y propaganda y con los gastos de la campa a a fin de estar pendiente sobre el origen de esos recursos
6909102 creemos que con la jornada extraordinaria de este mes de agosto en la que hemos realizado 16 conciertos en seis ciudades del pa s y se han desplegado 2 mil puntos de inscripci n fijos y m viles debemos llegar a los 17 millones de nuevos votantes
6909103 hacemos un llamado a los j venes venezolanos a que asistan masivamente a inscribirse en el registro electoral permanente apenas quedan 72 horas para la inscripci n y actualizaci n si los j venes no ejercemos dicho derecho al voto no vamos a poder elegir

6909105 es muy importante que los j venes venezolanos nos inscribamos en el cne porque esta es la garant a para ejercer nuestro derecho al voto la juventud venezolana fue ejemplo cuando luch contra el cierre de rctv y cuando derrotamos el proyecto de reforma constitucional el 2 de diciembre ahora el 23 de noviembre es una nueva oportunidad para rescatar los valores democr ticos de nuestro pa s
6909106 el brutal ensa amiento que demostraron los agresores del compa ero tor n solo es sin nimo del fascismo y la inhumanidad de personas segadas por el odio y el rencor consider que es inaceptable que este hecho quede impune cuando por causas menores de maltrato a trabajadores de medios privados se ha llegado a instancias internacionales
6909107 las diferencias pol ticas no deben pasar los limites de la violencia o de irrespeto al otro mucho menos debe ser raz n que afecte el libre desempe o de los medios de comunicaci n indistintamente de que sean privados o pertenezcan al estado ya que su fin es el de informar a la poblaci n de lo que ocurre en el territorio nacional as lo expreso el productor y compa ero de labores de tor n ronal pedroza

6909116 looks like this is going to measure acidic but not dangerously so
6909117 this reminds me of home to tell you the truth
6909118 this looks like a course that could be very easily in the midwest somewhere it reminds me of medinah a lot the grasses are the same we putt on poa annua greens a lot where im from its bentgrass fairways bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home
6909119 i think the course is in such good shape thats why the scoring is good
6909120 i think as we get further along the scoring could get a little bit better just because guys will find a way to play it understand it a little bit more and feel a little bit more comfortable with what they are doing out there
6909121 i probably hit it better than i did yesterday but nothing went in
6909122 its a lot more fun when youre not hitting out of the trees and chipping out sideways
6909123 i need to go out saturday and have a good day and shoot 6 or 7 under
6909124 i tried hard but struggled to focus this afternoon it really is a knockdown after the last couple of weeks
6909125 they were smooth they still held fairly well but you could tell that they are going to get firm
6909126 ive got two tournaments going on within one thats basically what i feel like
6909127 im trying like heck to keep it out of my mind but its nearly impossible i feel a little more pressure
6909128 youve got to drive the ball well and shape it both ways and make sure that your short game is in shape because its quite difficult around the greens
6909129 i had to hit every bit of a 3 iron in there
6909130 this is a great golf course this is one of the best courses weve played all year for sure
6909131 i was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow and got back and i thought hey its playoff time maybe ill just keep it
6909132 its a hockey thing in hockey guys grow the beards so i thought i would give it a shot and see if it works

6909136 the whole competition was mentally and physically the hardest thing ive done in my life
6909137 i was close to missing 5 80m but i made the big jumps when it counted
6909138 im just happy to put it together when it counts
6909139 i didnt care if i jumped an olympic record or 5 50m its all about winning out here
6909140 however the olympic record is really special to me tim mack is a really good friend of mine
6909141 i cant believe it i was not expecting to see more os than xs on my scorecard
6909142 i didnt expect to be there on my third attempt and to do it three times its very draining
6909143 i should have skipped the second jumps altogether they were not working for me
6909144 im starting to feel like a pretty happy guy you can probably see the look on my face as i go over the bar on the footage
6909145 i stood at the end of the runway before that jump and it was like something id imagined when i was a kid growing up
6909146 steves always been a bit adventurous and thats whats got him to those heights
6909147 it was nerve wracking for us but he knew what he was doing
6909148 our young athletes are the ones whove come through and theyre the ones were counting on into the future

6909175 superman didnt quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to
6909176 it didnt position the character the way he needed to be positioned
6909177 had superman worked in 2006 we would have had a movie for christmas of this year or 2009
6909178 but now the plan is just to reintroduce superman without regard to a batman and superman movie at all
6909179 along those lines we have been developing every dc character that we own

6909188 my ministry and the government extend full support and recognition to the initiative and we are confident that it will go a long way in promoting the cause of indian art and artists globally
6909189 there is a lot to see paintings sculptures very good photography and even better video the importance of the electronic media is growing among the younger lot of contemporary artists and there are very art oriented films being made in india
6909190 but this fair needs a wider audience artists do not make art just for the sake of dealers and buyers it should be promoted to a wider section of the audience

6909213 gene never complained about anything he just found out about the diagnosis sunday night i last spoke to him about a week ago this is such a shock
6909214 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6909215 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6909216 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6909217 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6909218 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene dustin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6909219 it is silly shes in no way my muse but she is one of the great american actresses
6909220 im just a big believer in you must love yourself before you can love anybody else and i think for me that breeds the most inspired relationships
6909221 its hard for me to have any proclamation about the right kind of love or how to love because relationships are so complicated and there are so many ways to love on one hand theres obsessive love and committed love and the love that friends just have for one another
6909222 im always so happy to come back to the states
6909223 i was born and raised in new york and so for me coming back home im like ahhh civilization i have such a nice association coming back to a city that i love l a too im always happy to be back in the u s
6909224 the fans were more upset about the break up than i was
6909225 its very clear to us this is a new competition
6909226 clearly the requirements have changed and the defense department is essentially asking for a different kind of plane from the first competition
6909227 weve both had more than three years to put forth our very best tanker design
6909228 by coming out and saying we need another six months boeing seems to be openly admitting that their tanker does not measure up to what the air force needs
6909229 the pentagon is quite mindful that congress is more likely to go to bat for boeing if this becomes a sole source contract i cant imagine boeing losing anything from taking this approach
6909230 if we dont receive sufficient time to prepare a competitive proposal theres really little option for us than to no bid in this competition
6909231 we think we can meet these requirements if given the time to put together a proposal
6909232 the protestors were chanting for the independence of tibet which has been part of china for centuries
6909233 there is no doubt that such activities violate chinese law
6909234 demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people
6909235 these rights are protected by chinas own constitution and by international human rights standards to which china has agreed
6909236 i blocked it all out its just one of those things where you see everything perfectly and it all seems to be in slow motion
6909237 when he gets on a roll i just pull out my pompoms and give a little cheer and keep smiling and clapping
6909238 thats what good blockers do when they get on a roll good luck to you
6909239 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6909240 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6909241 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6909242 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6909243 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6909244 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6909245 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birth date
6909246 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6909247 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6909248 if you trust every web site but not a government
6909249 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6909250 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6909251 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6909252 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6909253 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6909254 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6909255 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6909256 zuma nesta rock sounds like a water park ride or a new energy drink zuma is unusual and rather appealing for a girl its said to be taken from zuma beach in malibu and while place names are great they have to fit the gender of the baby but with the a ending and the popular z beginning as in zoe zelda zora zuma just sounds too feminine so does nesta supposedly bob marleys real name and its not a good idea to pair two a endings as first and middle names too cutesy
6909257 rock is probably thrown in there just to point to the parents careers and it does help to add some masculinity
6909258 this celeb couple certainly succeeded in choosing an unusual name and they succeeded in making an even stronger statement about their fondness for jamaica kingston is named after jamaicas capital and nesta was jamaican singer bob marleys given first name
6909259 when it comes to historical naming tradition both zuma and nesta are most frequently considered girls names as this child grows up he will likely encounter some name induced gender identity issues
6909260 as for the subliminal effect the first name zuma will encourage a career in acting or music so this baby could find himself following in a parents footsteps with ease but he is also likely to flounder when it comes to communication and relationship compatibility because he carries a name that will establish a highly private nature
6909261 it seems the rossdales scarified quality for quirkiness and its a good bet little zuma may be investigating a name change at some point down the road
6909262 first of all zuma zuma is a diminutive of the aztec name montezuma not sure the rossdales realize that but its also associated with the zuma beach in los angeles which is really beautiful a lot of people are using place names now and i think they used it after the beach most likely
6909263 i would recommend that the boy grow up using the name rock rossdale because thats probably the only normal name in there hes gonna grow up in the creative community so i dont think hell get picked on too much but theres only one percent of people surveyed on babynames com that said they loved it and 50 percent said they hated it thats a lot
6909264 kingston seems so upper class and just sophisticated that everybody was expecting another name that went along with it
6909265 he said do not stretch out your hand against the lad and do nothing to him for now i know that you fear god since you have not withheld your son your only son from me
6909266 the verse has no clear meaning if god was certain that abraham would fear him before he offered up his son
6909267 for the lord searches all hearts and understands every intent of the thoughts
6909268 even before there is a word on my tongue behold o lord you know it all
6909269 he abraham considered that god is able to raise people even from the dead from which he also received him back as a type
6909270 i the lord search the heart i test the mind
6909271 where can i go from your spirit or where can i flee from your presence
6909272 your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad
6909273 they built their high places of baal in the valley of the son of hinnom to offer up their sons and daughters to molech though i did not command them nor did it enter into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin
6909274 well instead of slamming mccain is obama really bashing the american dream
6909275 one pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small
6909276 there have been reports of loud distortion as well as clipping in the song at first it wasnt a big deal until the version being played on radio as well as the one on itunes had the same problem i along with many others wrote e mails to mission metallica as they have a history of providing great tech support well they have responded and sent an e mail to the fans who wrote them
6909277 i am sorry for the bulk e mail but weve heard from quite a few of you regarding the sound quality on the single release of
6909278 the source of the problem as you might imagine goes all the way back to the creation of the track from master but this is not how it will sound on the album
6909279 weve identified the source of the problem to prevent it in any subsequent singles released in advance of september 12
6909280 if we can have another one put together and sent out prior to that date there may be a higher quality release of the day that never comes made available but i cant guarantee it at this time
6909281 this is not three four minute little ditties these are pretty much all of them are quote epics most of them are seven eight minutes i think theres one at six you know but its that type of stuff when i think of those metallica records from the 80s i think of the songs being journeys that take you to all these different places and different musical landscapes and all that type of stuff and this is kind of what these songs do
6909282 most of you little shits werent even alive when k e a r t l m o p amp a j f a were first released
6909283 with their money youd think they could afford more than a 4 track
6909284 reminds me of how the lone ranger could always shoot the gun out an opponents hand without injuring them if that could really be done from an aircraft
6909285 its difficult to find fun interesting material for the odd mixture of instruments that i get to work with each year
6909286 the tunes also need to be friendly enough for younger players and accessible on a limited rehearsal schedule i think there will be a large market for this product
6909287 well if he ever did become a rock star id have to fight off all those hos
6909288 obama drama prepares to name mate flash fri aug 22 2008 17 52 03 et kmbcs micheal mahoney reports a company in kansas city which specializes in political literature has been printing obama bayh material more gill studios would not confirm information about the material they would not deny it either at least three sources close to the plants operations reported the obama bayh material was being produced
6909289 examine how vital uk institutions are coping with the demands and pressures of the new century
6909290 the medicine they are ministering may be as likely to kill as cure it
6909291 trustees governors regulators in all cases a distrust of television having mass appeal lurks beneath the surface
6909292 a version of television that is understood by regulators consultants strategists and media commentators
6909293 it likes to imagine television as a form of social engineering
6909294 here we have the deathless language of the committee each word carefully weighed balanced and rinsed of all life and passion a definition of psb that exists only in the minds of those whose job it is to write such definitions
6909295 television needs regulators just as roads need traffic wardens but you wouldnt ask your traffic warden to give you advice on what sort of car to buy still less how to drive it
6909296 id gone into the film thinking why are they doing it
6909297 from the second youre pregnant they tell you that breast milk can do anything from cure conjunctivitis to send your child to university if it could put the kettle on it would make you a cup of tea kind of thing so i knew that
6909298 i went back to work albeit part time relatively early at three months and i just felt it was really important to me when i came in the door and dereks mum had been looking after darcey all morning emotionally i could push her to one side mums here now and it was something only i could do that bond was really emotionally important to me and so i would never have been able to let someone else breastfeed her in a million years
6909299 they said what youre entirely thinking about is your role as a mother and your mental state youre not thinking about the child at all these were clever interesting women and they said thats all about you not the child id never thought about it like that before
6909300 i felt a bit like a milch cow when i was breastfeeding a bit unfeminine particularly when youve got a pump its a bit unsexy and you feel disempowered and thats been the view of breastfeeding for a while youre chained to this baby and its not the modern feminist woman but i came away from this documentary feeling the opposite just in wonderment at the female body just how clever the breast is if i was breastfeeding a baby right now and you sneezed within hours my body would have produced antibodies that through the milk would protect my baby from those germs its just an incredible thing that we take for granted but because of the sexualisation of breasts we dont see them as the clever brilliant things they are not in the way that we see the brain or the heart
6909301 before i wouldnt have because id have found it a bit icky
6909302 mine i wanted to make people stop and think about whether its crazy to feed milk from another species i want to go as far as possible to be provocative and shake people up without actually being so offensive that i upset gmtv viewers its quite
6909303 the thing about strictly is the worst you could say about me was that im a rubbish dancer you havent discovered any of my politics
6909304 and if youd been on love island in a bikini i dont think people could take you seriously interviewing gordon brown
6909305 they might not after my calf shoot actually well have to wait and see
6909306 oh yeah totally you have to be really aware of that you have to stay as neutral and credible as possible
6909307 because youre saying yes this shocking but its got your attention and now i want you to think about this project ive been working on because i think its fascinating and you might just do too
6909308 it depends what you think of as pr but what pr is i suppose is trying to show yourself in the best light and everyone on the show was trying to do that
6909309 i think hes always been that when i met him i dont think i ever believed in this idea that he was no longer a political animal i think he was very conscious of not being sucked back into his old life but it was obviously all still in him and i do completely admire that even though
6909310 weirdly actually we talk about politics so much less now politics at home has completely dried up i said to him you cant tell me anything because everyone will assume i know everything so its best i know nothing and hes got his outlet now whereas he used to rail at the television screen and bulletins about things he disagreed with now he just quietly makes a little note
6909311 the only reason to employ a presenter is because they hope it will increase the chances of people watching the show thats my job so i never object to being followed even though i know there are privacy laws that say you shouldnt be i kind of think you know what that is the name of the game youre on television youre asking people to watch your shows and get involved in your life i totally understand that that means youre a commodity for photographers and newspapers and things
6909312 i just think your job as a presenter is to form a relationship with the viewer and when that relationships formed youve got to expect that theyre going to want something back as well
6909313 so far theyve orchestrated the vice presidential roll out deftly delaying it until the eve of the convention to assure that they dominate the last days before opening night with real news while steadily ratcheting up the frenzy of speculation in the days beforehand
6909314 in dragging out the announcement of his vice presidential nominee to almost the eve of the democratic national convention barack obama has at once demonstrated his willingness to defy conventional political expectations and to hold the news media in his thrall while doing it
6909315 being military our family has a lot of stuff in our garage that i cant afford to get ruined
6909316 its not going to be the sizzle of the surge or high high wind
6909317 but 15 to 20 inches of rain will do a massive amount of damage
6909318 right now were just talking the precautionary measures taking things down moving things around
6909319 we feel like the low lying areas we may have to evacuate some folks but well have our high water rescue boats in place
6909320 dont get shirty its not like that i just thought you might fancy a chat
6909321 the pole is huge for us this track obviously track position pit stall selection those things are really important
6909322 i had to pedal it pretty hard coming off of turn two because i got back to the gas pretty quick and it shoved the front end a little bit
6909323 all in all it ended up being a pretty good lap it gave us a good pit selection and good starting position
6909324 is committed to achieving medium term price stability and will act as necessary to obtain that objective
6909325 we need a place where people can have a discussion and get information
6909326 and people need to know that its not coming from an anti mormon place or a gay castro district place its coming from a faithful place
6909327 when i heard and saw the letter that the church leaders had read in sacrament meetings i was appalled
6909328 so i said thats it i want mormons to know that there are gay people in their congregations every sunday
6909329 i really just want people to try and understand and see the pain they are causing gay members of the church who are struggling
6909330 provide license to infringe or impose upon the rights and liberties of others
6909331 if there would have been a site like this it would have been really helpful
6909332 last time during prop 22 all i did was vote no this time i wanted to stand up and be heard even though its hard
6909333 there is a lot of anxiety and stress over being conflicted being an active mormon and being for gay marriage
6909334 thats part of the reason we wanted to do the site
6909335 if you think you are the only person in your ward that feels that way and the rhetoric is really loud its painful
6909336 the church of course recognizes and accepts that some among its very large membership may view the issue differently
6909337 tutti ci dicevano giusto esserci ora penso di aver partecipato a un teatrino
6909338 invito gli atleti che sono ancora a pechino a fare la loro gara e dopo soltanto dopo manifestare a favore del popolo tibetano
6909339 se fosse servito a qualcosa ovvio perch la verit che i boicottaggi nello sport servono a poco ma questa vicenda questa notizia diffusa senza la conferma del dalai lama mi lascia stordita con un senso di amarezza dopo le intense giornate olimpiche
6909340 c stato un tam tam incredibile prima dei giochi ma appena arrivati sembrava messo tutto sotto silenzio nessuno ci faceva pi domande abbiamo fatto bene a venire mi dicevo mi sentivo tranquilla finalmente
6909341 mi sono ricordata del dramma del popolo tibetano mi sono sentita quasi in colpa per aver gioito per le mie due medaglie mentre nello stesso paese si reprimono le manifestazioni di gente innocente
6909342 ma io mi fido delle parole che vengono dal dalai lama indipendentemente dallattendibilit di quest ultima notizia sui morti nellest del tibet anche se non fosse vera da quanti anni lui denuncia la repressione vogliamo dubitare della sua sincerit
6909343 la colpa di tutti quelli che dimenticano anche se in cina sembrava tutto migliorato ma quanto migliorato vogliamo parlare dellepisodio demenziale che ha visto protagoniste noi fiorettiste durante la cerimonia inaugurale
6909344 da jesi a frascati a trieste vi conciamo per le feste
6909345 la tv cinese ci ha censurate se applicano queste misure per una sciocchezza cosa potranno fare per altri tipi di manifestazioni siamo stati protagonisti di un simpatico teatrino
6909346 a questo punto credo che le olimpiadi siano state inutili lorganizzazione impeccabile lo splendore esibito in questi giorni nasconde altre verit come le medaglie coniate per questa edizione davanti loro largento il bronzo dietro la giada che mi risulta provenire dallo sfruttamento di molti lavoratori
6909347 ripeto il boicottaggio cambia poco la storia lo dimostra il problema a monte risale al momento in cui stata scelta pechino come sede olimpica in questo scenario cinese anche il cio si sta dimostrando troppo severo come dimostra lepisodio del divieto di esporre la bandiera spagnola a mezz asta o di indossare un braccialetto nero per la tragedia di madrid

6909362 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
6909363 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
6909364 apparently a normal restriction to avoid births during a flight
6909365 voters donated money goods and services to elect a nominee and were defrauded by sen obamas lies and obfuscations
6909366 if the dnc officers had performed one ounce of due diligence we would not find ourselves in this emergency predicament one week away from making a person the nominee who has lost their citizenship as a child and failed to even perform the basic steps of regaining citizenship as prescribed by constitutional laws

6909379 what makes me laugh is that people are getting angry at the fact that bella got pregnant with a vampires child calling it unrealistic when we are all reading a vampire series where a vampire and human fall in love realistic no but did we all fall in love with the idea of love conquering all yes

6909388 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
6909389 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics

6909395 i told mr bowman in october of 2001 that the only people that had the capability to do this would be those individuals working at either united states government labs or private contractors and things of this nature and it obviously seemed to me that this was u s government related
6909396 at that point i assumed good faith on the part of the fbi in this investigation because it had killed several people it had shut down the united states congress which i think was probably the greatest political crime ever inflicted on our republic in its history but then i read that the fbi had authorized the destruction of the u s governments ames strain collection
6909397 i knew a cover up was underway because legitimate scientific researchers could have taken that collection and used it to genetically re construct precisely where and when and how the weapon came from this was clearly a federal crime in its own right
6909398 i believe the first anthrax attack was designed to ram through the patriot act because senators daschle and leahy were holding it up and once the anthrax occurred it rammed right through indeed on the renewal of the usa patriot act senator feingold was holding it up and all of sudden out of nowhere some white powdered substance appeared at one of the senate office buildings and all of a sudden the renewal of the patriot act went through
6909399 they are still doing it today if you read the investigation the press conference they heard the other day it does not add up if you read the article in todays new york times it does not add up it appears that the fbi set the investigation up by scientists in such a way that no one knew exactly what they were doing they could not communicate with anyone else and only communicated with and took samples from the fbi
6909400 there is today in existence a stock pile of super weapons grade anthrax that is under the control of the original perpetrators of the anthrax attacks of october 2001 and that stock pile can and will be used again when their masters decide it would be politically convenient to scare and terrorize the american people
6909401 they could launch another attack on us including congress the judiciary the media
6909402 i think what we need to do now is insist upon a full scale congressional investigation not some type of presidential commission cover up along the lines of the 9 11 report
6909403 you also have to tie into this the large numbers of dead microbiologists that have appeared since around the summer before these events when the new york times revealed the existence of the covert anthrax weapons programs run by the cia and that too is in the public record

6909429 he responded by saying that these are issues that will be part of our continuing discussions
6909430 i think right now theyre just trying to tease us
6909431 they want to drag this out build suspense into it
6909432 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
6909433 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
6909434 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

6909439 dati kasi focus talaga ako sa studies pero nung masama ako sa modeling nagustuhan ko na rin yung modeling tapos sa workshop may acting lessons kami sabi ko bakit kaya hindi ko rin i try ang acting dun na nagsimula yun
6909440 okay lang naman pero mas focus ko kasi ngayon is mahasa ako sa pag arte kaya tinanggap din namin ng manager ko yung stage play magandang training kasi ang maibibigay sa akin nito plus the discipline

6909451 wayne does too much around the pitch at the expense of what he does up front
6909452 it is a waste of his energy to chase back to our own penalty area for instance
6909453 but it is not something to worry about too much it is purely down to enthusiasm and natural energy he just loves playing football
6909454 he needs to be more involved around the edge of the box but it is only a small correction
6909455 if a player is out for a certain period there is no point rushing it

6909476 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

6909489 no industrial or sewage related discharges may affect the beach area
6909490 some sewage overflow pipes are discharging constantly when they shouldnt be
6909491 we know these overflows will be discharging more often now with the rain we have had this summer the sewage is heavily contaminated effluent and big pieces of debris which includes sanitary items plastic and organic waste which is flushed down the toilet
6909492 the treatment works are suffering because of the unseasonal heavy rainfalls we are getting and because of that they have to dispose of some of the sewage untreated through a combined sewage and storm water overflow
6909493 we regularly clean this beach but you can see cotton bud sticks and tampon applicators we know that surfers and bodyboarders whose sports result in swallowing seawater are three times more at risk than the average bather of picking up something like gastroenteritis

6909528 i own about fifty ambient cds and this ones the best for sleeping this album is so minimalistic that its almost not music or not like anything else ive ever heard nevertheless the way it relaxes you is unique i usually put it at the end of the playlist for whatever im listening to when i go to bed and i wake up noticeably more relaxed than when i listen to anything else
6909529 the police department the fire department the paramedics were wonderful
6909530 the biggest reason why this race remains close in this dem leaning political environment is because of obamas inability to close the deal with some of clintons supporters

6909561 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6909562 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6909563 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6909564 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6909565 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6909566 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

6909580 eens in de zoveel maanden komt het onderwerp weer bovendrijven
6909581 maar ik weet niet of het in de nabije toekomst al zover is

6909591 we like the depth that brown provides in a number of areas
6909592 hes a veteran that we have a lot of confidence in
6909593 last year they were able to keep everyone healthy and you saw what kind of product they put on the floor
6909594 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6909595 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6909596 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6909597 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6909598 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6909599 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6909600 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6909601 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6909602 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6909603 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6909604 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6909605 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6909606 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6909607 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6909608 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6909609 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6909610 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6909611 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6909612 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6909613 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6909614 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6909615 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6909616 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6909617 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6909618 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6909620 nasdaq serves as a self regulatory agency sro within the meaning of the exchange act 78 c 26 which vests it with a variety of adjudicatory regulatory and prosecutorial functions including implementing and effectuating compliance with securities laws promulgating and enforcing rules governing the conduct of its members and listing and de listing stock offerings
6909621 acting in its own interest as a private entity absolute immunity from suit ceases to obtain
6909622 we look to the objective nature and function of the activity for which the sro seeks to claim immunity
6909623 if congress had intended to extend the commissions jurisdiction over officers and directors of an sro it could have and would have said so explicitly
6909624 for me i just had probably the best game of my career we got in late and i was kind of tired today but a lot of guys say when youre tired you have your best days

6909629 because neal and i go way back i consider him a friend i have to do my job too but if i could choose someone else i would
6909630 i walked the first guy and put us in a bigger jam than we were already in i put one over the plate and he harris put a good swing on it
6909631 he looks pretty good over there today he swung the bat well
6909632 i know im strong enough to hit the ball out of the park but im not up there trying to hit the ball out of the park
6909633 i dont know where its coming from and im not trying to figure it out
6909634 improper collusion or collaboration between the nasd and the manhattan district attorneys office
6909635 it is by no means inconsistent to find that on the one hand the nasd exercises insufficient state action to trigger constitutional protections while nevertheless holding that the nasd is entitled to absolute immunity in the exercise of its quasi public regulatory duties

6909668 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6909669 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6909670 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6909671 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6909672 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6909673 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6909674 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6909675 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

6909713 given the listed issues we are recommending that xin net be issued a breach notice and that until these issues are resolved they be prevented from registering new domains the failure to comply with requirements to have accurate records the blatant and continued posting of illicit traffic sites and possible blocking of access to whois records point to a complete failure at xin net to accept its responsibility as a registrar we believe that this situation poses an immediate health risk to internet consumers and since xin net will not take proactive steps to prevent repeat offenders from registering fake pharmacy sites stopping all new registrations is the only way to break this cycle of illicit site registration and faux compliance

6909717 once again the mexican labour secretary is violating human and trade union rights to benefit the corporate sector in theory the labour authority is obliged to respect the law not violate it and interpret it in a prejudicial way against workers rights this attitude is an offence against the cabin crew who play a key role as safety professionals and their families there could also be an impact on passengers if safety is compromised

6909726 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

6909730 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6909731 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6909757 before long i had an epiphany because i even reached out to other writers and it wasnt working
6909758 i thought maybe im not being specific enough about what i want finally i just went with my gut instinct keep it up soulful happy and real i dont want to do anything but that i dont want to try to accommodate what i think other people want so i was super clear to myself and from that moment everything flowed
6909759 we decided to get back to the roots of recording we all set up in one room and communicated with each other rather than playing to something that had already been laid down to tape so in five days we had fifteen songs down leave the mistakes and keep the vibe
6909760 we completed the whole album in basically three weeks im so excited in a way i havent been in a long time it feels like so much has come together right this time and i think its because im not trying to prove anything anymore

6909899 your character doesnt feel like dancing they feel like doing special
6909900 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6909901 it is in the interests of all concerned not least the athletes themselves to resolve this issue once and for all
6909902 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6909903 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6909904 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6909905 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6909906 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6909907 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6909908 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6909909 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6909910 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6909911 if you trust every web site but not a government
6909912 there are so many web sites so much hearsay these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6909913 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6909914 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6909915 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6909916 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6909917 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
