7160000 all the players want to go to the next level
7160001 the practice facility speaks to that commitment of giving the necessary tools to have a chance at that goal
7160002 if you look youll see they had a little more success at alumni gym
7160003 they maybe had two or three percentage points less success in memorial coliseum and two or three percentage points lower but still in the high 80s or low 90s in rupp arena
7160004 basically what the rest of the league has to look forward to is four or five mens basketball facilities down the road kentucky may lose a reasonable number of home games if the pattern continues a new arena goes to 30 000 goes to 50 000 once it gets to 75 000 who knows they might only win 80 percent of their games
7160005 its good for everyone i know the kids are having a good time were doing it on a small scale now but its going to get bigger and eventually were going to try to do it in every part of kentucky that we can
7160006 you dont have to be a grown person to have a love for the wildcats i think youre born with it in this state
7160007 there are so many fans in eastern kentucky who may not get the chance to see the wildcats play and we want to get out here and touch everybody we can and make every opportunity available to them that could be a life changing experience to everyone
7160008 i just felt i really liked the campus and i really liked the coaches as well
7160009 we are very excited about courtney as a student athlete
7160010 this is great news but we never really anticipated any problems there was a process he had to go through it took some time but he and his family did all the right things we are looking forward to having courtney as a razorback

7160059 our goal is to make discoveries that will ultimately allow us to intervene with the most effective early therapy before a mild traumatic brain injury results in a chronic problem
7160060 there is a high prevalence of mild traumatic brain injury in soldiers and the consortiums work is driven by that we believe the conclusions of our research also will benefit civilians including athletes who have suffered concussions
7160061 the award of this grant confirms the collaborative platform of mission connect is a powerful and pivotal force in research
7160062 uniting these premier scientists in this shared research effort will accelerate the pace of discovery and provide the courageous men and women in our military with the best possible medical care for the brain injuries they have sustained
7160063 this grant is a huge boost to research in traumatic brain injury and will allow investigators to work together through mission connect
7160064 for baylor college of medicine it will help fund 10 investigators in neurology neuroscience neurosurgery and pain management and physical rehabilitation
7160065 only through collaboration can we make great strides in restoring function for our young brave men and women in the armed forces
7160066 we in the medical field must serve these men and women by moving the frontiers of treatment faster to provide state of the art interventions now
7160067 an effort led by drs doug dewitt and donald prough of the moody center for brain and spinal cord injury mission connect at utmb is a pivotal component of the department of defense project leading the field with a new blast injury model that simulates the exposure to improvised explosive devices additionally innovative therapies using stem cells anti inflammatory agents growth hormones and the expertise of aggressive rehabilitation at the transitional learning center round out the critical components of utmbs efforts
7160068 oxidative stress is a prominent feature of traumatic brain injury
7160069 we have developed a new antioxidant agent based on carbon nanotubes and in collaboration with dr thomas kent of the baylor college of medicine we will examine the therapeutic potential of the agent to treat mild tbi
7160070 our ability to apply novel intervention strategies to nervous system trauma based on the cellular and molecular biology observations made over the years would suggest that we will be able to make an impact on the treatment modalities to be developed over the next five years
7160071 at utmb the neuroscience research community has a long tradition of excellence dedicated to the understanding of trauma to the nervous system we are very happy to be able to make a contribution to this joint texas effort in what is an exemplary example of translational efforts at utmb
7160072 the institutions that make up mission connect have a long history of working together successfully this significant grant is testament to the fact that our collaboration makes us more competitive for funding than any one of our schools would have been alone and more importantly it strengthens our ability to improve the lives of those affected by traumatic brain injury
7160073 the award is very forward thinking since in addition to clinicians it includes neuroscientists working to elucidate the very basic and fundamental causes of nervous system injury all the way down at the molecular and cellular level
7160074 at present we know very little about how brain injury disrupts the connections and communication among neurons the neuroscientists participating will fill this huge gap in our knowledge armed with this information and working together in a collaborative environment clinicians and neuroscientists stand a much better chance of designing new and innovative treatments for traumatic brain injury

7160119 they showed mostly the limits of solar energy rather than the potential
7160120 to fly day and night we need a very efficient aircraft

7160130 i think its hard to tell because this pool is bullet fast i dont think you can say the suits made everyone faster they certainly contributed
7160131 but if you think its 100 per cent attributable to the performance movement in swimming then you are underestimating the work the coaches and the swimmers put in
7160132 you put on a suit that you know has broken so many world records you are going to be fast

7160148 i passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me that christ died for our sins just as the scriptures said he was buried and he was raised from the dead on the third day as the scriptures said
7160149 and if christ has not been raised then your faith is useless and you are still under condemnation for your sins in that case all who have died believing in christ have perished and if we have hope in christ only for this life we are the most miserable people in the world
7160150 but the fact is that christ has been raised from the dead he has become the first of a great harvest of those who will be raised to life again

7160175 its very curious because warren clearly authorized her to write this book
7160176 this is unusual a lot of money was spent on the book
7160177 he gave her access to his contacts his friends and the opportunity to get to know him better than any other writer which is what makes the book so outstanding
7160178 would we love to have warren buffett doing interviews for the book who wouldnt but were moving ahead as planned
7160179 people were beginning to slice him into tiny bits investor corporate manager whatever
7160180 i thought this man has a unified way of looking at everything it is one set of ideas the right book answers the question what events in his life formed this man and influenced him

7160189 sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7160190 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7160191 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7160192 the american bishops have instructed catholic voters to consider many issues but have characterized the defense of human life as foundational and have explained that the issue has a special claim on the conscience of the catholic voter this means that a political candidate like biden because of his strong support for abortion rights forfeits any claim for support despite his views on other issues like health care and the economy

7160274 since 1993 almost 400 women and girls have been murdered and more than 70 remain missing in ciudad ju rez and chihuahua mexico all the evidence seems to indicate that these young women are chosen by their killers because they are women who have no power within chihuahuan society itself characterized by high crime rates and public insecurity due to the fact that drug trafficking and organized crime operate in the area the women are often workers from the maquilas or export factories set up by the multinational companies that control the economy of ciudad ju rez as well as waitresses workers in the informal economy or students many of them live in poverty often with children to support they are women who have few options but to travel alone on the long bus journeys that take them from the poor suburbs surrounding ciudad ju rez to their place of work or study
7160275 critics say investigations have ground to a halt because of corruption incompetence and witness intimidation activists say what is going on in ju rez is a national outrage and when the fbi was brought in to help at times chihuahua state officials rejected its findings former fbi profiler robert ressler believes at least one of the killers has access to both sides of the border
7160276 viewed as test cases for both the state and federal governments amnesty international and other activists are monitoring authorities actions in punishing former and current government officials identified as engaging in negligent and even criminal behavior in previous murder investigations so far none of the 130 chihuahua state authorities deemed negligent in reports by former federal prosecutor maria lopez urbina have been punished several of the officials argued they were just following orders but no known investigation of their superiors is underway

7160279 at the same time killers now frequently jump borders jose manuel torres yake a peruvian national was arrested in hiroshima japan last year for raping and murdering a 6 year old girl the suspect had a previous criminal record in peru for raping two other minors
7160280 in a country of 14 million people with one of the worst murder rates in latin america 427 people were killed in january alone guatemalan authorities are quick to blame gang violence and prostitution for the unsolved crimes involving both men and women

7160443 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all
7160444 thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7160445 i had some very wise words and some very good advice before coming into the 10m competition to just enjoy it have fun and thats what i thought right from the very first dive in the prelims to the very last dive in the final
7160446 i was definitely stressing it to myself just enjoy the moment there is nothing you can do to change whats about to happen so just enjoy it and it worked
7160447 the first dive wasnt the best the third dive wasnt the best but there was nothing i could do about it except just enjoy the moment he said
7160448 i knew that the best diving would come and the next three dives were really good for me
7160449 absoultely everything i have done has been for this mitcham said
7160450 coming back and doing everything that i did was to win an olympic gold medal
7160451 it was his best dive and thats why we put it at the end sobrino said
7160452 the expectancy of that dive was around 106 108 points but not 112 never he did it at the right time at the right moment in the right pool with the right crowd so im pretty happy and we got the right medal
7160453 i have been toying with the idea of staying on and doing some synchro with matt mitcham but im pretty sure thats it for me he said
7160454 full credit to matthew he put on such an awesome job the whole time that we have been here he has been training really well all through the prelims semis and final he just executed how it should be done and walked away with the gold medal helm said

7160612 i completely take the burden for his loss i didnt execute and i didnt get in a rhythm to let the team drive down the field
7160613 in the hands of a p plate driver a high powered v8 or high performance engine is a deadly weapon
7160614 perhaps moving away from the geographical regions of mid north central west southern regional convention and turn those into the health convention the education convention the farming convention the crime convention
7160615 the womens groups rural and regional womens council all have to start grabbing good women and promoting them and its not just six months out its now
7160616 cannot swallow whole the view of lincoln as the great emancipator
7160617 as a law professor and civil rights lawyer and as an african american i am fully aware of his limited views on race
7160618 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7160619 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7160620 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7160621 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7160622 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7160623 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
7160624 what is your disability do you think you are really capable of doing this job how would you manage if you were required to leave this building in an emergency
7160625 in times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists
7160626 the government of mexico asked us to give the cemex businessmen another chance to see if we can reach an understanding
7160627 but the mexicans of this company have been arrogant very arrogant and we demand respect here buddy
7160628 we want to settle this in a friendly way like we did with the french who stay on here as our partners
7160629 challenged the government and i dont know what else at the meetings
7160630 you know mr president that first and foremost i defend the interests of my homeland the interests of my people not those of businessmen
7160631 they know youre there theyre looking at you if they wanted to hurt you if they smacked that tail on you youre gone youre dead
7160632 what i find annoying and frustrating is the arguments coming from people overseas they havent been here and been in with the whales
7160633 its not in our interest to harass the animals they are our livelihood
7160634 i found i couldnt tell people about it when i got out of the water
7160635 their beauty their gracefulness the lack of fear in something weve nearly hunted to extinction
7160636 theres just something there that i connected with and ive never found it anywhere else
7160637 some have quite a close encounter and we have no doubt its a fantastic experience and for many a very emotional experience
7160638 it could be argued that if you offer that kind of experience to the general public then youre creating a passion for the whales that could ultimately save the whales
7160639 i fear if that happens again the government might stop it completely
7160640 that you can swim with the whales here is very very important for tourism ive done it once its just an awesome experience
7160641 it was very beautiful i cant explain it but it changed my life
7160642 puddin tang ask me again and ill tell you the same
7160643 puddin tang ask me again and ill tell you the same
7160644 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7160645 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7160646 its not fair i dont have any good pictures of you cant you just please cooperate
7160647 we believe that without investments in soa governance 60 90 of soa related projects will fail to deliver a positive return on investment
7160648 it is not possible to benefit from soa as an approach unless you can effectively leverage and manage soa artifacts not just services themselves but also soa related policies processes and metadata
7160649 the 509 pro has exceptionally flat performance out to 512 mb filesizes with speeds exceeding 55 mb s
7160650 we aimed at providing a really good solution for business users to meet their storage and file sharing demand at the same time the file transfer performance is the key to business productivity enhancement we believe the ts 509 pro is the answer to these requirements
7160651 according to the netbench test results in qnap lab the ts 509 pro is 3 to 10 times faster than all the other nas at the same level our nas is able to provide steadily outstanding performance during multiple concurrent data access this reflects the ts 509 pros capability as the most ideal file server solution in a business environment
7160652 that was a pretty good performance from zambrano hes got to be the story tonight
7160653 he was really good tonight im hoping the younger guys watched him pitch because thats how you pitch in the big leagues
7160654 i feel pretty good its been a lot of work to get to this point but i feel pretty good about it and about myself
7160655 the most important thing is that every pitch i threw i felt like it was a very strong pitch i had good location thats pretty much what i was looking for
7160656 outstanding fastballs breaking pitches everything i think was good those kind of guys always have a game plan last week when he was throwing the split was all right but today every pitch was good he hit the glove and got a lot of ground balls
7160657 pavano has a strikeout a changeup and he has a strikeout slider but both of those guys were good i think hes ready to do something in new york to help the team
7160658 the first day he walked on campus you could see it
7160659 i dont know what it is but he has it i dont know how to describe it but you can see it in everything he does whether its playing cornhole or playing ping pong
7160660 they told me that id probably be taking some punt returns but other than that i have no idea
7160661 there are so many quarterbacks under 6 foot who have done things in their career
7160662 its not like id be the first i just love playing quarterback ive always loved the leadership role and im trying to become a leader on this team
7160663 zack freeman woke out of a deep sleep to see his butt perched on the edge of his bedroom window it was standing on two pudgy little legs silhouetted against the moon its little sticklike arms outstretched in front of it as if it was about to
7160664 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7160665 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7160666 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7160667 may have the ability and incentive to influence global supply and global prices for iron ore lump and fines
7160668 steel makers in australia and overseas could face significantly higher prices for iron ore than bhp billiton and rio tinto would achieve in the absence of the proposed acquisition
7160669 i think our result showed that petroleum is a key part of the portfolio
7160670 and we really see our results as laying the foundation for more strong performance to come and for the diversified low cost portfolio to work for us
7160671 these defendants undermined the basic precept that consumers are safe to assume that when they purchase retail health and safety products they are buying what the label says they are buying a parent should never have to fear that buying an everyday item like toothpaste could put a family at risk
7160672 this case demonstrates the departments continued commitment to prosecute aggressively criminals who seek to profit by importing and distributing counterfeit goods that put our citizens health and safety in jeopardy
7160673 the defendants lined their own pockets by trafficking in counterfeit goods without concern for the dangers those goods posed to the health and safety of consumers
7160674 these convictions demonstrate our continuing commitment to protect public safety and manufacturers property rights
7160675 we believe all hospitals no matter how well theyre doing have the opportunity to improve the care they deliver to patients
7160676 the publication of this data was a way to continue improving the processes of care
7160677 we are very proud of the valley baptist medical center harlingen team of nurses physicians and other healthcare professionals whose dedication made these better than national results for the treatment of heart failure possible
7160678 we are proud to be one of only three hospitals in texas and 37 in the nation to receive this recognition
7160679 our ranking by cms hospital compare as one of the lowest in mortality rates for congestive heart failure coupled with our ranking as the no 1 cardiac surgery program in the state further reflects that our community does not have to leave the valley for heart care
7160680 we finally got to sit down and relax for a little while
7160681 thats what i came down here for but even at that i knew nothing was going to be handed to me i came out here in the summer and practiced and worked hard im excited
7160682 youll always have those questions what if i left earlier but i learned a lot at illinois and i dont really regret going there
7160683 but it got to a point where you pretty much rule that playing out as an option it all became routine
7160684 hes humble and he leads by example he didnt get recruited by illinois for no reason billys definitely got the tools
7160685 of course when i came down here i wanted to play and start
7160686 but i had to put in a lot of work and effort it was just a matter of time now i got my chance
7160687 she issues orders as to how she thinks i need to run the police department without having any knowledge of the day to day operations
7160688 she has created an intimidating and hostile work environment and is causing me unnecessary grief mental anguish and undue stress
7160689 why would we try to get rid of our police chief i look at my crime rate and its down
7160690 tell us why were reasonable people if there are grounds i can understand
7160691 what i found was that his administrative skills were needing to be improved
7160692 im doing my job for the people that live in my community and for those police officers
7160693 coopers solution along with the mayor and two councilwomen is to throw more money at it so he can do a better job
7160694 the blue alert program will be a powerful tool that leverages the eyes and ears of many toward the apprehension of criminals who threaten our protectors
7160695 as police officers we represent societys law and order and were given that power by the people
7160696 its a wise use of those resources we have that we havent had in the past
7160697 i never thought i would end up as a delegate
7160698 not everyone gets to go and see how this process works
7160699 the older people dont listen to us as much because they dont hear from us as much
7160700 but because were the future of the party they listen when we do decide to speak
7160701 this presidential election has brought out a lot of new people from all ages and backgrounds
7160702 were working to keep them involved in the statewide and local elections too
7160703 the voters in my district elected me to the convention because they support clinton
7160704 but i know it will be a lot of fun
7160705 n o a criou simplesmente para nada mas para ser habitada
7160706 os justos possuir o a terra e residir o sobre ela para todo o sempre

7160709 i probably didnt hit it as good as today as i did yesterday but my putter really got hot
7160710 its great to get the putter rolling obviously it helps your score but it helps your psyche as well
7160711 its hard to complain with 67 but it was one of those rounds that really could have been something special
7160712 i had some opportunities on the front nine i let get away and then i had opportunities on the back some holes i didnt take advantage of its nice to be in the hunt but it was one of those could of should of
7160713 dedicated to providing coloradans and the entire country with live on the ground coverage through the use of new media tools
7160714 people from all across the country and beyond want to know what will be happening in denver
7160715 and we will be there to provide viewers the breaking news that sometimes gets cut from newsrooms
7160716 you want to pick somebody who complements you and strengthens you
7160717 im glad that joe will be sitting in the oval office working with barack on the important decisions he brings a wealth of experience
7160718 other than the office i wouldnt want to make any parallels
7160719 instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done
7160720 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7160721 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7160722 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7160723 ive watched as hes inspired millions of americans millions of americans to this new cause
7160724 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous
7160725 as an irish catholic with arguable working class roots and with much appeal to white ethnic voters in places like pennsylvania his presence on the ticket may help with key demographic groups in the east and midwest
7160726 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7160727 my thoughts are along the lines of the line in the jerry mcguire film you complete me
7160728 obama needed a helping hand from his vice presidential pick on the foreign policy front the recent russia georgia crisis underscores this and thats what he will get
7160729 obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7160730 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7160731 they wanted a provocation at sea but they wont get it
7160732 we didnt have anybody famous it was old fashioned people power we just wanted to show what happens when ordinary people from around the world get together to try breaking this immoral siege on gaza
7160733 we never intended for this to be a humanitarian mission its about human rights in gaza
7160734 hes still able to turn his legs over fast enough with high power
7160735 he overcomes his average start and just doesnt slow down as others do in the last 30 to 40 meters hes able to relax and coordinate his longer legs
7160736 no one can really know exactly how fast a human may be able to run
7160737 we have no way of knowing if humans might not have been even faster centuries or millennia ago
7160738 report on the deteriorating security situation as well as the food crisis
7160739 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7160740 the captain thought im going to return to gatwick as a precautionary measure we treat safety as a highest priority
7160741 im confident that we can protect children here and that is my top priority the protection of children not of offenders
7160742 it enabled mr gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival here
7160743 there has been no opportunity to put forward why he was innocent of those crimes for which he was convicted in vietnam
7160744 he did not commit the offences for which he was convicted in vietnam
7160745 it was a show trial and he had no opportunity to put his defence forward ultimately he wants that to be tested if he can before the courts of this country
7160746 ghaffur is very unhappy because the met is briefing against him
7160747 details of the claim will not be available to anyone until next week
7160748 long honourable and occasionally blood stained record on the championing of diversity
7160749 you might think if you were attempting to define psb for this modern competitive age that your very starting point would be what can we do to help ensure the continuing breadth of televisions appeal
7160750 but ofcoms four purposes are the opposite a recipe for the niche the marginal the worthy try hanging them outside a west end theatre see who buys a ticket
7160751 lets scrap saturday nights completely dramas out and comedy too no role for sport the champions league final euro 2008 the olympics the 14 million people who tuned in to the final of britains got talent werent there to be entertained but to watch tv promote understanding of religions cultures and lifestyles
7160752 i probably didnt hit it as good as today as i did yesterday but my putter really got hot
7160753 its great to get the putter rolling obviously it helps your score but it helps your psyche as well
7160754 its hard to complain with 67 but it was one of those rounds that really could have been something special
7160755 i had some opportunities on the front nine i let get away and then i had opportunities on the back some holes i didnt take advantage of its nice to be in the hunt but it was one of those could of should of
7160756 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7160757 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7160758 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7160759 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7160760 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7160761 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7160762 obama had a fork in the road go for experience or change
7160763 i think people in the united states can get a little irritated by my work
7160764 frustrated even they think im a clever clever boy but ive found its okay to be in a state of conflict and opposition you dont want to be too embraced
7160765 at least as long as i can get up and down the stairs
7160766 the three set in europe were told to me by other writers and my publisher while the newark story happened to my stepfather he was actually there when the mayor broke down and cried in the middle of the riot
7160767 a coup by legal and political means the reality is that al gore was elected which means were living in an alternate universe an alternate reality like owen brick in the real world there would be no war in iraq no torture at abu ghraib and possibly just possibly no 9 11
7160768 the idea that this great man should have to suffer the loss of such a fine son is appalling
7160769 i wrote man in the dark during a very short period of time
7160770 just four months it kept writing itself it was the most intense experience ive ever had as a writer
7160771 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace
7160772 most of whats on it is false ill give readings where the person introducing me will provide information that is simply wrong ill ask them where they got it and invariably theyll say the internet
7160773 novels are about inner life about the experience of being in the world from inside
7160774 films are about life from the outside rarely do they touch the depths of novels
7160775 once we were done we had a screening for the distributor after saying how much he liked it he added almost as an afterthought that it had no commercial potential at all thats just how it is these days especially in america theres no life left for marginal films
7160776 i dont know why im gravitating toward stories about death
7160777 its probably nothing more than a function of getting older
7160778 its good to inhabit a young person again especially in that era
7160779 his mailbox read the bill smith not bill smith but the bill smith
7160780 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7160781 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7160782 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7160783 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7160784 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7160785 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7160786 the selection of biden the 6th term chairman of the senates foreign relations committee is a direct admission of obamas own weaknesses and inexperience
7160787 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7160788 after decades of steady work across the aisle i know hell be able to help me turn the page on the ugly partisanship in washington so we can bring democrats and republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the american people
7160789 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7160790 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7160791 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7160792 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7160793 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7160794 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7160795 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7160796 at least 70 innocent civilians most of them women and children
7160797 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7160798 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7160799 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7160800 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7160801 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7160802 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7160803 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7160804 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7160805 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7160806 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7160807 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7160808 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7160809 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7160810 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7160811 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7160812 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7160813 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7160814 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7160815 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7160816 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7160817 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7160818 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7160819 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7160820 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7160821 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7160822 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7160823 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7160824 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7160825 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7160826 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7160827 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7160828 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7160829 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7160830 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7160831 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7160832 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
7160833 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
7160834 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7160835 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7160836 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7160837 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7160838 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7160839 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7160840 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7160841 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7160842 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7160843 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7160844 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7160845 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7160846 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7160847 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7160848 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7160849 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7160850 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7160851 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7160852 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7160860 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7160861 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7160862 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7160863 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7160864 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7160865 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7160866 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7160867 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7160868 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7160869 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7160870 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7160871 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7160872 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7160873 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7160874 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7160875 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7160876 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7160877 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7160878 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7160879 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7160880 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7160881 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7160882 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7160883 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7160884 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7160885 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7160886 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7160887 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7160888 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7160889 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7160890 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7160891 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7160892 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7160893 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7160894 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7160895 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7160896 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7160897 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7160898 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7160899 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7160900 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7160901 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7160902 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7160903 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7160904 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7160905 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7160906 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7160907 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7160908 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7160909 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7160910 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7160911 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7160912 the area is near a very busy part of south east london a large number of bus routes use walworth road and it contains many fast food outlets
7160913 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area around 02 30 to 02 45 bst or even before that time and may have seen or heard anything suspicious
7160914 i have no suspect descriptions at this stage and there has been no weapon recovered
7160915 it is imperative that russian forces fully and speedily implement and abide by the commitments that it has made
7160916 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7160917 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7160918 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7160919 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7160920 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7160921 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7160922 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7160923 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7160924 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7160925 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7160926 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7160927 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7160928 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7160929 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7160930 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7160931 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7160932 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7160933 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7160934 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7160935 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7160936 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7160937 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7160938 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7160939 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7160940 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7160941 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7160942 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7160943 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7160944 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7160945 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7160946 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7160947 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7160948 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7160949 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7160950 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7160951 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7160952 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7160953 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7160954 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7160955 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7160956 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7160957 a derailment of a train with about 50 people on board has occurred and the train fell into a ravine
7160958 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7160959 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7160960 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7160961 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7160962 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7160963 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7160964 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7160965 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7160966 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7160967 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7160968 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7160969 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7160970 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7160971 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7160972 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7160973 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7160974 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7160975 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7160976 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7160977 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7160978 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7160979 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7160980 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7160981 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7160982 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7160983 we said we made the money now we need to give it back to society and so we established a foundation primarily to do good work in general for rural development
7160984 our animals were dying because of lack of water after the two dams were built the bore wells have water
7160985 yes it is good the dirty puddles on the roads have reduced because our neighbour has it
7160986 the person i admire most in the fight against that controversial and admittedly unconstitutional memorandum granting the milf its bangsamoro homeland is adel tamano being a muslim himself tamano has placed national interest above self he is the kind of a muslim we need in government and i can predict hell go places
7160987 keep coming keep coming keep coming at bat after at bat at bat after at bat
7160988 youve got to be cold blooded to be in that situation and actually only focus on seeing the ball and staying in your zone
7160989 i knew he was a great pitcher with a great fastball
7160990 he throws real hard but i knew the situation with the bases loaded i was trying to get the runs in at the time
7160991 that was one of the toughest games for me in my career one of the toughest that ive lost
7160992 just being ahead like that and boom we lost it was just a tough game to swallow
7160993 amazing great job to be able to get to him in that inning and get to the bullpen it says a lot about how much our guys battled at bat for at bat
7160994 both those pitches that he hit out i really liked them
7160995 we obviously think hes a very talented driver he said of logano
7160996 anybody got an ace go fish the 26 year old american was consistently hitting first serves at between 125 and 130 mph
7160997 stockholm was in scandinavia it was my first tournament and it was smaller than this she said
7160998 here its the tournament before the u s open and its a really big tournament you know i have beaten some really great players on my way to win this tournament
7160999 i just didnt have power especially in the third set chakvetadze said
7161000 if you are not able to run and fight on the court then youre going to lose the match
7161001 not today but if i compare it to one month ago its much better so i look forward to play the u s open the most important tournament obviously is coming in two days i hope i will stay fresh for each match
7161002 i enjoy playing i enjoy playing for a big crowd you know when youre in the finals you dont have anything to lose you can just win
7161003 wait wait i have to take a picture of the entrance to the exhibit
7161004 gads jewels on my feet did she take a gander at my feet why on earth would i want to draw even the slightest attention to those big dogs

7161008 people are confused and lethargic not simply because they are tired of hearing the gospel or because they have never really been emotionally gripped by it but also because they are confused they have not heard the gospel in a way that provokes a thoughtful basement to attic reappraisal of themselves and their world
7161009 ive always found theres a real turn on to watching and knowing its stars are people you could run into in the grocery store
7161010 for the government to use a public resource to promote such degradation shows how detached the bureaucracy is from the canadian people

7161023 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
7161024 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7161025 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
7161026 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
7161027 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7161028 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists

7161035 know this when one of your coaches is asking for perfection or damn near it there is an unwritten agreement that it may not happen immediately we understand this but believe truly that over time you are capable of developing beyond your current standard the coachs job is to re inforce the things you know that you know remind you of the things you forget you know and teach you the things you didnt know you didnt know all you have to do is fight for it the process is the important part of this journey and part of that process is fighting for perfection none of us will ever attain perfection in many of the skills we practice but merely get closer to mastery the struggle is where the learning is and shouldnt be approached or dismissed lightly it is your responsibility to truly want to improve no matter what your current skill level so enjoy the process enjoy the road but most of all enjoy the struggle even if its not perfect fight for it

7161040 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
7161041 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
7161042 i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another
7161043 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is illicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit

7161177 when you consider that it doesnt include another four years of secondary education plus five more years of medical school if he wants to follow his previously stated goal to grow up to be a doctor like his daddy this will come as an interminably deep chasm of drudgery and imprisonment to connor
7161178 its difficult to know the effect on his psychological well being when he grasps the full truth that his education will be followed by approximately four decades of work bills and taxes during which he will also rear his own children to face the same fate all of which will of course be followed by a brief almost inconsequential retirement and his inevitable death

7161502 we leave it lingering in the depths of our fridges and cupboards unused and unloved when we do use it we use too much and even then we dont use the leftovers
7161503 its an approach to food that anathema to older generations their cooking of leftovers was the earliest form of recycling they used up every scrap of food because they valued it today that attitude has changed but its vital that we change it back
7161504 when food waste rots in landfill it produces methane a greenhouse gas 23 times more potent than the co2 pouring out of your cars exhaust
7161505 if we dont mend our wasteful ways well be eating ourselves out of an environment that can sustainably support future generations of australians
7161506 making your own lunch can eliminate the leftover salad and chicken for a sandwich tuna bake or pasta as a hot meal instead of buying snacks taking fruit to work even a tupperware of grapes helps to eat up fruit that could go bad otherwise

7161510 in all i was very impressed with the canon eos rebel xsi and would wholeheartedly recommend it to someone looking for a good camera and lens combo in that price range i came to know its inner and outer workings very quickly thanks to a very smart design and layout
7161511 canon has done it again the rebel xsi is a strong upgrade to an already excellent and rightfully popular digital slr image quality performance and utility have only improved which makes the canon rebel xsi an easy daves pick and a great value for anyone looking to get better pictures
7161512 i highly recommend the rebel xsi for anyone shopping for a dslr in the entry level range its a great camera that has a number of advanced features with which you can grow as a photographer
7161513 if youre someone that is either partial to canon cameras or already have a higher end model a set of lenses and are seeking another camera body thats small and light weight yet without serious feature limitations then the canon xsi may well be the camera that youve been looking for as we have seen image quality at least within its iso range is on a par with anything else on the market and better than most in this price range
7161514 opening the box i was surprised at how compact this camera is adding on the optional 18 55 is image stabilized lens makes for an easy to always have on hand camera that gives exceptional images considering its price the construction isnt on par with the much more expensive canon cameras like the 40d but for the majority of consumers who want to step up from their pocket sized cameras into something with more capability and control the rebel xsi is worth a good look
7161515 straight out of the box the rebel xsis photo quality is a mixed bag the biggest problem i have with the photo quality is that jpegs are way too soft at default settings especially if youve seen how they look in raw mode the good news is that you can increase the sharpness with the picture styles feature and get much better results exposure was very good and colors were accurate the xsi is a superstar when it comes to noise performance theres minimal noise even at iso 1600 in low light noise is more present though photos are usable through iso 800 without any retouching while purple fringing wasnt an issue the xsi does have a bit of redeye problem and theres no removal tool on the camera
7161516 the xsi is more of an evolution than a revolution the new features it adds over previous digital rebels are useful and generally well executed but none of them add that much to the experience of using the camera the live view makes point and shooters feel more at home but focusing in that mode is a pain as the camera has to flip the mirror back up to meter the increase in resolution is also nice but 10 to 12 megapixels is not a huge leap and the optical image stabilization on the kit lens is definitely a good addition but there are plenty of other slrs that offer similar features so nothing in the xsi screams out for xti users to upgrade
7161517 the xsi is fast and responsive produces quality images with astounding color and is feature packed the xsi looks and feels heavy to me but not when im acutally using it it is a delight to use and is very fast and responsive buttons and dials are intuitively placed and the menu system is good the optical viewfinder is large and bright which is important to me because i use viewfinders a lot
7161518 canon have been leaders in the entry level dslr market for years and with the eos 450d i cant see them losing their position anytime soon the camera is packed with features and playing with it more and more reveals extra bits to try out
7161519 once again an entry level dslr is let down by its kit lenses however we did take the camera to an outdoor wedding and used the 55 250 lens exclusively and the combination was better than competent focus is a little erratic and the image stabilization isnt very effective but in the areas that mattered keeping fine detail in white dresses and black suits the output was exemplary fortunately at weddings the epitome of sharpness is not whats wanted rather a little softening of the fine details flatters the bride and thats what we got the shutter is loud during the quiet bits of the service
7161520 this brings us to the 340 question the difference in price between the xsi and canons 40d what does the higher priced camera give you a much tougher metal body with excellent weathersealing beefier innards including a 150 000 cycle shutter a smoking burst rate of 6 5 fps user changeable focusing screens and iso 3200 shooters who are tough on their stuff will want the 40d no question but given the capabilities of the rebel xsi as well as its price its one very sweet deal
7161521 the eos 450d bears the fruits of more than 20 years of ongoing investment into eos
7161522 this camera continues canons policy of taking technologies proven in the professional arena and putting them within reach of a wider market of amateur photographers

7161527 if youre looking for a go anywhere pocketable camera in this price range you owe it to yourself to look at canons g9 i believe that it truly represents todays gold standard for point amp shoot camera performance and specifications
7161528 both of the g9s zooming modes perform very well the 6x optical zoom is extremely useful and will get you close enough to almost any reasonably distant subject and for those times where you need all the reach you can get the digital zoom gets the job done
7161529 despite these foibles some would call them endearing character traits the canon powershot g9 is an amazing machine and its probably just the kind of super point and shoot that will appeal to serious photographers who may want to stop and think before they press the shutter release
7161530 the reviewer notes upfront that they typically test dslrs so their reviewer of the g9 may be slightly bias actually the review was to see if the g9 could be used as a dependable companion camera what they didnt like it was difficult to get a precise setting while zooming its optical viewfinder was not very accurate and yet they had a tough time composing using the lcd
7161531 while it delivered great photographs there were some irritating aspects to the g9 namely the slow responsive zoom what was most frustrating was the lens servo motor drives the lens forward in chunks rather than a nice smooth zoom another problem was shutter lag which made photographing subjects other than stationary was very difficult
7161532 the g9 is not a perfect camera if tiny size is your ultimate arbiter there are other cameras if youre a stickler for image quality the g9 doesnt offer much that other highly regarded cameras lack these days very good image quality is not hard to come by but the g9 is a very good camera it has an excellent feature set thats very well implemented and is housed in a body that looks great and feels even better although beginning photographers may be overwhelmed by the g9s plethora of buttons controls and features at first its easy enough to put the camera into a fully automatic mode that makes it very simple to use you can then grow into the rest of the features as your skills improve
7161533 as the top of the range model before venturing into dslr territory the powershot g9 is bound to be very good and despite some of its flaws it is
7161534 was i already satisfied with the g7 looking at the canon g9 laying here in front of me my photographers heart starts beating faster this feeling also comes from the solidness of the camera the canon g9 feels like a solid tool it may not be the most compact or the lightest camera but the advantages outweigh this factor greatly once holding the camera in your hands you feel the trustworthiness and the camera leaves a solid impression behind
7161535 a feature list as exhaustive as the unabridged oxford dictionary includes manual control over the aperture shutter sensitivity and focusing a hotshoe for a flashgun and lens adapter ring but the g9 isnt just for wannabe pros even the most clueless shutterbug can snap away using scene modes and face detection
7161536 the canon g9 is a fantastic camera but it is not for everyone let me explain although the powershot g9 does have a green auto mode where all important decisions are made for you by the camera it is not really meant for the point and shoot enthusiast if you only take the odd holiday snap or shoot the kids around the house you would be well advised to look elsewhere as this camera is really too advanced for snapshots only
7161537 sure i wish the canon g9 were just a bit smaller to fit in a shirt pocket without strangling me but at least the canon g9s large body contains a lot of good stuff with above average performance a 6x optical zoom image stabilization and that gorgeous 3 0 inch lcd the canon g9 is the g series reborn though its still lacking the swivel screen i found the canon g9s big lcd useful enough that i didnt miss it much
7161538 if quality is what counts for you the canon powershot g9 should be towards the top of your shortlist it is packed with features offers excellent picture quality and has a good build quality too
7161539 build quality is one of the g9s key strengths constructed almost entirely out of metal it is extremely sturdy and feels capable of taking some hefty punishment the controls are nicely laid out and the interface is intuitive although the shutter button and zoom controls are a touch on the small side the 3in screen is a noteworthy upgrade increased from 2 5in on the previous model it is bright and crisp and makes framing your shots a breeze
7161540 in the final analysis the g9 has more to recommend it than most enthusiast compacts we test and at iso 80 the quality is simply superb its a pleasure to use is built like a tank and offers an slr like feature set in a compact format yes you can buy a powershot a650 is same lens same sensor similar feature set and a vari angle screen for around a hundred dollars less but take my word for it the g9 is in a different league
7161541 the canon powershot g9 is a very powerful compact which will greatly appeal to enthusiasts or anyone looking for a pocketable backup for a dslr it features a wide array of manual controls which unlike many compacts are sensibly implemented and on the whole unrestricted the quality lens offers a useful 6x range and sports both optical stabilization and impressive macro facilities on the top is a fully featured hotshoe which supports canons speedlites complete with in camera control over the 580ex ii and even its wireless transmitter and the icing on the cake is support for raw recording
7161542 as long as you dont let the iso sensitivity wander too high youll get very good quality photos from the powershot g9
7161543 the new 3 inch purecolor lcd screen is a great addition that almost makes it possible to ignore the small optical viewfinder although its reassuring to have that on standby for really bright conditions or if you prefer composing a picture with the camera at eye level less satisfactory is the new 12 1 megapixel sensor although this offers 4000 pixel wide high images that can easily be printed up to a3 size and beyond or to make severe crops it comes at the notable cost of noisy images at iso 400 and virtually unusable iso 800 and 1600 modes the excellent image stabilisation system does help to ensure that the g9 can handle most common shooting situations but dont expect stellar results when using the camera handheld in very low light in all other respects image quality is excellent so you may want to overlook the noise issue so overall and even more so than the previous g7 model the canon powershot g9 is an excellent back up compact for an slr owner and a great camera in its own right
7161544 robustly built comprehensively feature packed and small enough to slip into a jacket pocket the powershot g9 has a lot in its favor because it offers many of the same shooting controls and supports raw file capture it would make an excellent compact back up camera for dslr users it would also provide some useful features that are not provided in dslrs you get good range of video formats including widescreen and facilities for adding sound bites to pictures or making audio recordings however the g9 it is not a beginners camera and its body is not designed for maximum handling comfort its also relatively pricey for a digicam although the price is largely justified by the cameras image quality and functionality in knowledgeable hands its capable of delivering excellent results
7161545 the canon powershot g9 isnt perfect its burst mode is slow its 6x optical zoom doesnt function in the movie mode and its autofocus system takes more time than it should but its almost there it is fairly priced at 499 as it is stuffed with lots of great features manual controls and high quality components which make it worth the price
7161546 i could probably write much more about the g9 it has many more features and highlights than ive noted but i think you get the idea its an exceptional little camera whose specs and performance would have been hard to imagine just a few years ago particularly for 500 if youre looking for a go anywhere pocketable camera in this price range you owe it to yourself to look at canons g9 i believe that it truly represents todays gold standard for point amp shoot camera performance and specifications
7161547 as recently as two years ago many digital camera industry insiders were predicting the imminent demise of top of the line read expensive prosumer enthusiast digital cameras due to the introduction of affordable entry level digital slrs those dire prophecies clearly havent come to pass the g9 has a few warts but at this point in time and when compared to the other cameras in its class the g9 is as good as it gets if thats not enough raw is back the g9 is more powerful it has more features and its cheaper msrp than its predecessor
7161548 after the disappointing lab results of its predecessor the canon powershot g7 we were a bit skeptical of the canon powershot g9 not anymore in general we like what we see we like adaptive noise raw conversion we like a compact camera that syncs with external strobes we like full manual controls and we like scene assist modes to help beginners get better with their compositions before venturing into the uncharted waters of full manual control we love the focus confirm and face recognition instant playback we like the high quality half camera half computer panoramic capture mode overall we like this camera a lot however were not so impressed with iso 1600 image quality nor the mostly useless low resolution iso 3200 mode
7161549 the canon powershot g9 gets a leg up over its predecessor by improving photo quality and restoring raw format support while maintaining the same excellent performance and body design you probably cant miss with this model as a compact backup for your dslr olympus fe 360 and fe 370 announced olympus has announced the fe 360 and fe 360 digital compacts both are 8 0 megapixel and offer face detection image stabilization a number of shooting modes video capture etc olympus mju 1060 announced olympus has announced the 10 megapixel mju 1060 digital camera features include a 3 0

7161553 the toronto argonauts would like to thank michael bishop for his years of service and contributions to our team
7161554 we wish him well with this new opportunity in saskatchewan
7161555 in making this trade we certainly respect the toronto leadership for acknowledging michael had been placed in a very difficult situation via the kerry joseph deal
7161556 athletically they hated to see him go but both adam rita and rich argos head coach rich stubler expressed a desire to be fair to michael given the many contributions he made to their club
7161557 in that regard its important to remember toronto went 11 1 with michael as their starting quarterback in 2007
7161558 as to what impact this trade will have on our current quarterbacking situation that is as it should be a coaching decision
7161559 kenny wanted michael in green and white weve accomplished that and kenny will assess the overall situation as we go forward

7161570 everyones a writer now everyones an editor this is the democratization wrought by the web and its chief effect at least upon journalism is to diminish whatever craft and there is some is left in the business it is not true that anyone can write it is not true that anyone can write on deadline it is not true that anyone can do an interview it is not true that anyone can edit themselves and sort wheat from chaff
7161571 journalism wasnt meant to be a conversation anyway it was maybe a monologue at its most democratic a carefully constructed dialogue

7161609 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7161610 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7161611 it creates a troubling perception when washington policy makers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7161612 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7161613 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7161614 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7161615 theyre definitely not a team youd want to face a lot with the pitching staff they have and obviously the hitting they are getting now
7161616 a lot of times especially at this time of year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time and those guys are playing very very well right now
7161617 i guess everyone saying its a totally new me or whatever
7161618 i just went down there and worked on what i worked on while i was here and just got back to myself
7161619 i have a rather large nose and it actually grazed off my nose before it hit my bicep which was kind of funny
7161620 i was actually laughing about it when i was coming back to the dugout it did it actually grazed my nose and hit my bicep next whatever it worked
7161621 i was so bad on friday it couldnt go anywhere but up
7161622 this is how funny this game is you can not get a ball out of the infield one day and do what i did today you take the good with the bad and hopefully you have more days like this
7161623 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7161624 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7161625 im interested to see how i kind of react to it thats what ive been working for my whole life
7161626 my cousin came and watched me last week and told me
7161627 the rough is less thicker i think they stopped watering it so you can actually play its playable and some places you can get yourself in big trouble
7161628 but i think its playing really well the greens have been drying out really fast and depending where the pins are tomorrow its going to be a tough day
7161629 that little 10 m p h wind with the big trees it has that augusta feel where you think its going this way and it might go this way and thats the difference between maybe having as 10 footer or a 30 footer
7161630 i tried to hit a little 64 degree wedge and it came out and i heard it ding my club on the follow through

7161633 we knew in theory there were a handful of stump toothed biblebillies and neocon dead enders out there but by all rights we should have had at least a 60 75 lead even after barack threw that awesome victory rave in germany the numbers kept deteriorating
7161634 then it dawned on us mcsames subliminal attack ads were stoking the deep rooted latent racism of white middle america we needed to warn these uneducated simpletons that mcsame was exploiting their superstitions and genetic bigotry the big question was how
7161635 i couldnt be prouder of all of you wonderful young indy rock assholes
7161636 you represent our partys finest the best of best you are our douchebag delta force
7161637 a lot of the plebe douchebags come in here full of swagger thinking all it takes is a few hours of fm country music endurance training and i have to tell them they have no idea what theyre up against
7161638 we tell them straight up we arent your mommy or daddy or your au pair there arent any independent lesbian film festivals in youngstown and just because iowa has a lot of farmers it doesnt mean they are going to see a lot of sunday chill out farmers markets
7161639 after that shock wears off we tell them about how the natives drink pabst unironically
7161640 but the ones who stay are much less likely to crack under the pressure of a two week isolation from american apparel or urban outfitters
7161641 most douchebags take pride in being in on trends and bands before anyone else and abandoning them before anyone else
7161642 when we tell them their conversion target is fat middle aged western wisconsin wal mart moms it creates an ethical dilemma in many of them they have fears that the mission success conflicts with their own finely tuned sense of douchebag exclusiveness and superiority

7161644 still i admit some harbor thoughts of abandoning the campaign for edgier more out there bands like nader or ron paul

7161651 the piece is a great conversation starter with the local proletariat
7161652 i use it to demonstrate how obama is all about change and unity and cutting edge postmodern sculpture and how he will fund public arts programs to bring it to their dismal little hellhole towns

7161658 unfortunately this election comes down to winning the hearts and minds of whitebread middlebrow middle class middle americans
7161659 i think the energy and diversity of these young douchebags will really help obama in the swing states
7161660 it shows that the appeal of obama transcends chicago government union thugs and celebrity shitheads
7161661 it goes beyond the usual grumbling over lack of graffiti art and gritty yet trendy warehouse districts
7161662 after i talk with some of these morons ill ask them so youre going to vote for obama right
7161663 but in the back of my mind i cant help shake the notion that theyre using sarcasm too
7161664 but no shit iowahawk might get up tomorrow get baked grab his beautiful wife and ride his moped backwards to a hells angel rally then drink himself into oblivion and fight about 7 crank dealers from the racine chapter of the death jokers all by himself then maybe hed go home romance the beautiful wife build a perfect retro treehouse for his perfect kids drink a bottle of tequila prepare a 3 course meal while beating away a push in home invader and sacrificing him on a makeshift though historically accurate inca altar he built in the woods behind the railroad tracks then hed sit down and knock out a tremedously insulting leftist parody that pissed off thread after thread of kos and du lunatics romance the bride once again and fall asleep chuckling its like hes paul bunyan and mark twain rolled up into one hipster

7161669 if iowahawk ever decides to turn his guns on you accept your beating with good grace and a rueful chuckle if you try to fight back it only gets funnier
7161670 next time iowahawk beats up on you just take it if you try to fight back it only gets worse its like one of those monsters that the harder you fight it the stronger it gets because it actually feeds on your pathetic swats

7161684 inspired i was going to say parody but really it is far too close to the original to be called a parody really it is like the play hamlet stages to catch the conscience of the king a dramatic re enactment of the very crime claudius had committed but had yet to acknowledge it worked for hamlet will iowahawks performance work for the rest of us it is too early to tell but it is more truthful and far more amusing than anything youll read in the new york times

7161690 im on the board of a literary magazine at a small state university and at the boards meeting this spring the editor mentioned that he had wanted to reprint the blogger iowahawks hilarious swipe at the archbishop of canterbury unfortunately the editor said the magazine couldnt do reprint it the legal adviser from the universitys administration had said no not on the grounds that it was offensive to anglicans and their archbishop but on the grounds that it mentioned islam and the school could receive bomb threats as a result of publishing it
7161691 good thing that iowahawk exists otherwise wed have to invent him
7161692 you almost cant parody this mess but iowahawk can and does so again brilliantly

7161723 here is an incredibly easy to use and stylish 8 megapixel digicam this is a great camera for anyone looking for a point n shoot model only it has very few options for adjustments and no manual shooting modes the performance was a little slow for a consumer model in this class but the quality of the images are good and the size makes it one of the smallest and easiest to carry cameras on the market with an msrp of us 179 we feel this camera offers a good a deal for anyone who is in the market for a simple digicam that can fit into the smallest of pockets
7161724 the good small sleek and attractive some nice features for the money the bad relatively slow poor to average photo quality for its class january 29 2008 tokyo nikon corporation is pleased to announce the introduction of the coolpix s210 a stylish new camera thats a pleasure to carry and a joy to shoot with built on a custom application of nikons innovative expeed digital image processing concept and incorporating the precision optics of a nikkor lens the coolpix s210 places advanced shooting functions comfortably in the hand for greater fun with photography outstanding imaging ability begins with 8 0 effective megapixels of sharp resolution it gets even better with its digital image processing engine that faithfully reproduces fine details and subtle tones delivers quick response and maintains image quality and clarity when taking advantage of extended light sensitivity settings as high as iso 2000 and completing the triad is the clarity and precision provided by a 3x zoom nikkor lens that covers a practical range from 38 114mm 35mm format equivalent to ably capture everything from group shots to close up portraits electronic vr image stabilization adds extra reassurance that the results will be sharper and clearer especially in lower light or when shooting moving subjects olympus fe 360 and fe 370 announced olympus has announced the fe 360 and fe 360 digital compacts both are 8 0 megapixel and offer face detection image stabilization a number of shooting modes video capture etc olympus mju 1060 announced olympus has announced the 10 megapixel mju 1060 digital camera features include a 3 0
7161725 between 8 and 11 depending on how you count them totaly value around 14 mill
7161726 good points solid reassuringly weighty build given its plastic look and feel fast in operation and more user friendly than expected a helpful array of features not usually found on a digital slr never mind in this price bracket tilting screen coupled with live view is a boon for creative angled shots
7161727 the sony alpha dslr a350 has a lot going for it it has an impressive but not perfect live view system image stabilization for every lens you attach plenty of manual controls and great battery life it also has some usability issues that i dont care for including a small viewfinder poor lcd visibility outdoors and in low light and a few too many buttons in addition its photos have quite a bit of detail loss at high iso settings while other cameras will deliver better photo quality than the a350 none approach its live view capabilities thus its worth a look if live view is an important feature for you since the typical shooter doesnt need 14 megapixels i think most folks will be better served by the less expensive dslr a300 though
7161728 you tend to classify the sony a350 as a semi pro camera
7161729 in terms of ergonomics and controls the a350 has much in common with sonys new entry level a200 its nicely balanced the grip is more comfortable and it feels solid and well built unlike the olympus e 510 pentax k20d and sonys pro level a700 the a350 doesnt sport weather and dust seals but it does include a dust repelling sensor coating and a sensor shake function to help dislodge dust
7161730 the a350 offers two advantages first its perfect for folks who are looking to upgrade to a more sophisticated camera but with minimal complications second people who want really high resolution with all the latest cool controls low light photos held up really well with minimal noise even at iso 800 on board noise reduction was not aggressive and photos did not end up unsharp or fuzzy
7161731 its actually a fun camera to use its straightforward and uncomplicated with menus that are easy to figure out and navigate it seems to have a little better build quality over the a200 and according to the reviewer the live view mode really camera in useful bottom line this camera is an easy to use entry level dslr that allows beginners to take great looking pictures
7161732 autofocusing speed is very decent especially when the eye start feature begins the af process for you
7161733 it is my first dslr with my most recent other camera being a canon s2 is superzoom point and shoot have not used a slr camera since before the digital age am very happy with it image quality as youd expect is far above that of the s2 is and there arent any image quality issues that i can determine relative to other dslrs resolution seems great color is spot on etc
7161734 i already owned a sony a100 and liked it alot so when the a350 came out i was expecting it to be good and it is some additional controls true ttl viewing even longer battery life than the a100 which means ive taken more than 1 000 photos at maximum quality without a battery change and it handles quickly and accurately
7161735 a350 was my first dslr i only buy it because of its quick af live view feature very good like a compact camera
7161736 so why get this camera vs other brands first off this camera is great for anyone wanting to get into digital slrs if you have old minolta a mount lenses you can use them with this camera
7161737 ive been able to hand hold existing light shots down to 1 20 of a second thanks to the anti shake feature pretty cool i would have never thought i could take such a slow hand held pic without it being all blurred
7161738 mainstream users stepping up to dslrs are looking for a similar experience to their point and shoot cameras but without compromise in speed or performance
7161739 quick af live view gives these new models a familiar shooting style without compromising speed ideal for the growing market of first time slr users
7161740 the sigma dp1 is best suited to wide angle photographers who value image quality and aesthetics as the primary photographic attributes whether these are landscape photographers or street photographers may not really be the question
7161741 but did it have to be such a lame camera no zoom no stabilizer no focus lamp no optical viewfinder no live histogram weak flash washed out screen quarter size movies infinite shutter lag loose lens cap
7161742 if the lighting is attractive and your subject is not moving and you have a minute or two to get the photo then for a small camera the sigma dp1 will give you unprecedented results
7161743 the sigma dp1 is not a pleasant camera to use in many ways it feels like a throw back to the bad old days when compacts were in their infancy responsive is not a word you would use for this unit
7161744 as it stands though the dp1 has not been developed to its full potential yet and can only really be recommended for landscape photography and similar applications in reasonable light and to photographers who can live with a frustratingly slow speed of operation and the other shortcomings we have talked about above
7161745 in some way the new sigma dp1 is a great concept use a small p amp s like camera insert a larger dslr sensor here the foveon sensor of the sigma sd14 and add a good lens larger sensors can mean less noise and more image quality
7161746 the bottom line then is that the sigma dp1 is able to produce very high quality images possibly the highest from any current pocket sized camera
7161747 in my opinion despite all the limitations the sigma dp1 can produce the best images of any small light weight p amp s camera that i have ever seen or used and not by a small margin even at iso 800 it produces results that are unimaginable with other p amp s cameras at any iso
7161748 this is not a camera for point and shoot photographers this camera is particularly suited for people who intend to shoot raw low light performance was middle of the road with substantial loss of color in long exposures shot in jpeg the cameras flash was crummy in that it could not illuminate even a medium size room at any iso setting while the camera operated pretty fast its auto focus was painfully slow in low light
7161749 one flaw is the optional viewfider which fits in the hot shoe the problem is you cannot use an auxiliary flash and the optional viewfinder at the same time oops also there are some pretty weird preset like wax museum
7161750 oh well here goes a try and i hope its different this time
7161751 i dont know im not worried about that its a great personal accomplishment but my motivation is one reason and one reason only and thats to get to the playoffs and win the world series

7161810 i really cannot see any particular advantage in proportional representation as it means coalitions form after elections when the voters have no more say rather than before them first past the post also allows strong decisive government necessary for the measures badly needed in this country and its important corollary the possibility of a thoroughgoing ejection of an unwanted ministry in pr systems you cannot turn the rascals out or know in advance what you will get
7161811 i am not infallible and do not claim to be yes i have strong views and often ride roughshod over the opinions of others
7161812 as for my intellect i fail to see what mr williamson can know about it besides hes hardly dazzled us with his own erudition on this weblog

7161819 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial mr tanner told network ten
7161820 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7161821 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent
7161822 the end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the reserve bank to cut interest rates

7162001 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

7162021 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

7162029 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area said moalin adan warfa an elder from kismayo
7162030 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes said villager hasan muktar

7162047 in every country young people hope here in italy there is no hope anymore
7162048 your mom keeps you home nice and softly and you stay there and you dont fight and if you dont fight it is impossible to take power from anybody
7162049 we dont have a google we cant imagine in italy that a 30 year old opens a business in a garage
7162050 but in reality many businesses ended up closing because fundamentally the market didnt need them anymore they didnt want to change

7162297 il governo francese gli ha conferito nel 2000 la prestigiosa onoreficenza della legione donore
7162298 i suoi racconti hanno il potere di ispirare i popoli lautore diventato nel tempo una vero mito della letteratura mondiale
7162299 e linizio di un lungo e fecondissimo tramonto nonostante la morte avvenga molto pi tardi il 14 giugno 1986 accanto a borges la sua seconda moglie lamatissima mar a kodama
7162300 i had heard that it was by far above and beyond other communities
7162301 like taking a spoonful of water out of the pacific ocean
7162302 it doesnt really mean a lot to raise fares because at the end of the day its not an efficient service
7162303 eventually id like to see these monies allocated to something thats successful
7162304 most of these people theyre handicapped not to the extent that theyd take metro mobility but to the extent that they cant walk a couple blocks to the bus
7162305 it has had a huge impact on our driver program just a huge impact
7162306 get more bang for our tax money and maybe even serve more people in the city
7162307 ive been told i cant comment a polite but sombre looking lee said
7162308 it came as a shock to a lot of his close friends one cricketer who did not want to be named said
7162309 the stringent overall environmental requirements of the olympic games actually served as a catalyst for various measures and the countdown to the games made it even more urgent for the entire society to take action

7162311 the 25 minute ride is not troublesome at all for me its just picking up an old habit again in middle school i used to ride my bicycle every day as most of my classmates did
7162312 these bulbs can help cut my electricity bills in the long run
7162313 on the battleground of climate change we need more green champions i believe these athletes influence will help people translate the green concepts into practice
7162314 there has been a distinct increase in public awareness of environmental protection
7162315 even if children are allowed to play games its necessary for parents to limit the time spent playing them
7162316 we cant be certain that devoting hours of time to playing games doesnt have a bad influence on childrens brains at an important time in their development children generally find that no matter how tired their brains get they cant stop playing because its fun
7162317 even if children are allowed to play games its necessary for parents to limit the time spent playing them
7162318 children may become less competent at building personal relationships with others if they spend too much time just playing video games
7162319 these days its not unusual for children only to communicate when it suits them and for them not to know how to verbally approach others they want to play with in the real world
7162320 when playing video games children can only play in a world that has been provided for them by the creators of the games
7162321 this may make it difficult for them to develop creativity and the ability to think independently i want parents to find time to take their children out to play in the real world
7162322 while it is easy to get carried away by romantic images in movies where you meet someone of your dreams instantly fall madly in love get married maybe have twins and live happily ever after we are ordinary people in real life
7162323 that at the same time you have this rising call in america to restrict immigration
7162324 some people want to choke off the very thing that makes us strong and unique
7162325 america and china should enjoy their medals but we should each also reflect on how the other team got so many
7162326 is the idea if an idea has not been implemented it is premature to call it an idea it is rather a notion a daydream or perhaps a fancy if one has such a thought the first order of business is not to send out proposals or give speeches or navigate through process but rather to sit down and write some code build a prototype share it with some like minded people incorporate their feedback expand the community and iterate if one does this and ones ideas are sound the process naturally follows people naturally gravitate to good ideas

7162331 he is one of this citys most engaging media stars
7162332 its hard to believe ive found a second career that lets me talk even more than i do right now
7162333 my husband saw this bright orange light we ran up to the loft to have a look and it suddenly zoomed out and up it was like a bright orange rugby ball and it had a sort of halo around it like a street light it moved up and to the left quite swiftly
7162334 it disappeared into the clouds then soon after another one did exactly the same at the same point in the clouds there were four in all
7162335 i got onto the internet after it happened and so many people have seen similar things i dont think it was a chinese lantern because we would have seen a flame underneath it we thought maybe it was some military plane but we couldnt hear any engine at all i have never seen anything like it in my life i hadnt been drinking alcohol i promise i am the first one to be sceptical of anything like that
7162336 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
7162337 as the two lights came over it was noticeable that they were making no sound at all
7162338 we watched them pass over the house flying towards sileby but they had not gone far before they disappeared
7162339 at 10 30pm i saw 10 of the orbs travelling from an easterly direction then turning northerly at about two minute intervals
7162340 it wasnt making a sound it was large and orange we didnt know what it was
7162341 i could not identify the object after 10 minutes of research on the internet i pretty much confirmed it was a fire balloon
7162342 i was going for a walk at the time and i watched three of these things lift off from the ground
7162343 someone had either made or bought some lanterns with candles in that acted as miniature hot air balloons
7162344 because it was clear when it was high up in the sky it did appear to be a ufo
7162345 personally i do believe there are ufos and i have seen some peculiar things in the sky but youve got to sort the wheat from the chaff
7162346 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
7162347 we support the creation of this ufo trail because experts say that it is a hot zone for watchers
7162348 in no way can we guarantee that a tourist coming to san clemente will see a ufo
7162349 it was an orange object located about 400 meters 1 312 feet in the distance with oscillating movements
7162350 there sightings have been made of shining spheres going into the water and into wooded zones without any human explanation
7162351 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
7162352 were going to be running into some desperate teams teams that are fighting for their lives
7162353 we certainly dont go into any game not expecting a tough game
7162354 after that canberra game is was just a matter of us getting our confidence back in each other and obviously it was a game that took a fair bit out of us
7162355 credit to the boys they turned it around by thrashing the bulldogs 52 16 last week
7162356 we definitely know how hard it is going to be against the storm but if we play to our potential anything can happen
7162357 the more we can cut down on flights and the better we can recover between games the more it will help us later on
7162358 we are meeting in secret with a congressional committee if these meetings were public it would prove
7162359 well we used to have a dog used to so i thought id make a dog puppet since we dont have one anymore
7162360 wipe that broccoli off your lips you mean ol grasshopper
7162361 we have to fatten them up so we can have a nice chicken dinner dad
7162362 wait senator you have to explain first your position about live birth abortion ban
7162363 actually ive got the testimony of jill stanek a nurse from illinois hospital heres the video
7162364 its a natural reaction for spectators to get passionate when theyre supporting their team but were urging everyone involved in junior sport to encourage from the sidelines not shout abuse
7162365 its a great way for them to learn about the different student organizations to buy that last minute poster and to just generally have fun so this is just a festive way to say welcome to the university and heres a lot of whats going on here
7162366 so how many recruits have you pulled in today weve got a few its still early they had a long night last night

7162368 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in the agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7162369 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7162370 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7162371 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7162372 the military tradition here at fort ontario goes on today because our unit the 479th engineers company b just returned from iraq a few weeks ago
7162373 its disgusting that so many zimbabweans are kept in custody even after theyve finished serving their sentences
7162374 most of the zimbabweans i have met were put in prison for crimes like using false passports now that may be wrong but its very different from a hard crime besides people should be free once theyve paid their debt to society
7162375 it meant we had to rely on ordinary people to put up the cash and time
7162376 its a big commitment guaranteeing bail you have to spend a lot of time with the person once theyve been released not to mention the possible loss of money but remarkably lots of ordinary people have said they were willing to do so
7162377 these people may have been in prison but they have served their time
7162378 the only reason they are still kept in detention centres is because the government cannot deport them to zimbabwe but how long is the government willing to keep these people it could be years before zimbabwe is safe for these people to return to
7162379 forging cheques was a stupid thing to do it was at an immature time in my life and i would never do it again
7162380 i think the fact that members of the public are putting up bail money will encourage these zimbabweans to make sure they stick to their bail arrangements i dont think george will let me down
7162381 its fundamental that we expect companies to behave both within the law and morally
7162382 unacceptable risk of complicity in current and future severe environmental damage

7162387 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states
7162388 your kitchen tables like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much youre worried about being able to pay the bills
7162389 well thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7162390 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7162391 barack has the vision he also has the courage the courage to make this a better place and let me tell you something else this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7162392 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7162393 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7162394 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7162395 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza

7162475 if you would not pay for medicine out of your own pocket then dont bother to go when others offer to pay
7162476 i had gone through too much not to make the olympics
7162477 i know in life you often have to go through some bumps in the road to reach your ultimate goal i always kept focused and kept training and i was confident that this moment would happen
7162478 that which is on earth we have made but as a glittering show for the earth in order that we may test them as to which of them are best in conduct
7162479 o mankind we created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that ye may know each other not that ye may despise each other verily the most honored of you in the sight of allah is he who is the most righteous of you and allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted with all things
7162480 those who believe in the quran and those who follow the jewish scriptures and the christians and the sabians and who believe in allah and the last day and work righteousness shall have their reward with their lord on them shall be no fear nor shall they grieve
7162481 if anyone slays a human being unless it be in punishment for murder or for spreading corruption on earth it shall be as though he had slain all mankind whereas if anyone saves a life it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind
7162482 i have a responsible grown up life but peel back the trousers and i am a hot blooded undieboi
7162483 x is classified fatally poisonous iff administering x to y causes y to enter a state classified dead
7162484 the difference between living humans and dead humans is a nice local property a compact cluster in thingspace sure the set of poisons might not be as compact a structure a category x x gt y may not be as simple as y if the causal link gt can be complicated here poison is not locally compact because of all the complex ways that substances act on the complex human body but theres still nothing unnatural about the category of poison we constructed it in an observable testable way from categories themselves simple if you ever want to know whether something should be called poisonous or not theres a simple experimental test that settles the issue
7162485 because you are forced to formulate the blegg category or something closely akin to it in order to predict your future experiences as accurately as possible if you see something thats purple and egg shaped and opaque the only way to predict that it will be flexible is to draw some kind of compact boundary in thingspace and use that to perform induction no category means no induction you cant see that this object is similar to other objects youve seen before so you cant predict its unknown properties from its known properties cant get much more natural than that say what exactly would an unnatural property be anyway
7162486 thats fundamentally a moral question no simple experimental test will settle the issue unless we can agree in advance on which facts are the morally relevant ones its futile to say this chimp can recognize himself in a mirror or terry cant recognize herself in a mirror unless were agreed that this is a relevant fact never mind it being the only relevant fact
7162487 what happens if we run a dna test on terry schiavo
7162488 what happens if we ask terry schiavo to solve a math problem
7162489 i dont know so ill strategize conservatively to avoid the boundary case or treat uncertain people as people
7162490 aaaiiieeee technology asked me a question i dont know how to answer technology is undermining my morality
7162491 ask me what is or isnt a paperclip and see if i say yes thats your new meta utility function
7162492 we translate pattern into choreography and we translate pattern into math
7162493 see that thats where you find the base content for self renormalizing morality
7162494 what can archimedes do if he has to program a friendly ai despite being a savage barbarian by the futures standards so that the future comes out right anyway then whatever general strategy archimedes could plausibly follow that is what we should do ourselves for we too may be ignorant fools as the future measures such things
7162495 what can the pebblesorters do despite wanting only to sort pebbles so that the universe comes out right anyway what sort of general strategy should they follow so that despite wanting something that is utterly pointless and futile their future ends up containing sentient beings leading worthwhile lives and having fun then whatever general strategy we wish the pebblesorters to follow that is what we should do ourselves for we too may be flawed
7162496 you see those humans over there thats where your utility function is
7162497 you may also want a composite image of a lot of apples that have multiple possible reflective equilibria
7162498 you see those humans over there whatever desire is represented in their brains is therefore right
7162499 things not intended to express territorial anger should not have black and white stripes
7162500 delves deep into the scandals and cover ups of the global wrestling industry where drug addictions sociopathic superstars and broken families are the norm and situations like benoits are all too often ignored
7162501 yeah we love you too now get out of here
7162502 i know who you are but i love you anyways
7162503 youve got to be kidding me this was a joke right please say that was a joke
7162504 how could you say that how could you say that a movie with such love such passion such pain could be so awful
7162505 because it is not possible it doesnt work like that in real life two people cant just be in love and live together so passionately and peacefully with an obstacle as big as lung cancer in their lives its just not possible there has to be problems turmoil devastation its just the nature of this world sometimes i cant believe you received the grades you did though out high school and college
7162506 im in love with you adrian i always have been ever since we first met i thought it was obvious but i guess not i t kills me to sit here by you and not touch you all i want to do is hold you in my arms and try to tell you exactly how i feel but you know the funny part the funny part is is that no matter how hard i try i will never come close i will always no no the funny part is how i sit here with you and never say a word but as long as you are by my side everything would be perfect adrian lowered her head and pressed it up against sheas i mean what am i supposed to do try living in my shoes try knowing that no matter what you do you know you will never be good enough think about that and youll know exactly how i feel when i look at you

7162518 remember that hitler was an atheist who killed millions in the name of atheism and secularism also the nazi party was thoroughly grounded in atheist anti christian ideology
7162519 10 books that screwed up the world and 5 others that didnt help
7162520 we might easily think that hitlers genocidal ambitions were rooted entirely in his virulent anti semitism but mein kampf helps to reveal that they were merely one malevolent effect of a far deeper more profound and pervasive evil a
7162521 given the epic scale of their inhumanity we need to remember that the nazi regime did not purport to do evil it claimed to be scientific and progressive to do what hard reason demanded for the ultimate benefit of the human race the superhuman acts of inhumanity were carried out for the sake of humanity

7162548 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly
7162549 in naming my colleague and friend sen joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7162550 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7162551 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate
7162552 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7162553 you used to be about the hair product tight pants and disposable love ditties

7162556 what was jason bournes birthday first of many bourne trivia questions that will come forth over the next few hours
7162557 lets hope biden obama are winning ticket our country cant take 4 more years of this crap
7162558 well thats the first time ive seen a street squabble actually broken up by the police lights sirens and jumping out with tazers drawn
7162559 i could take this rainy overcast weather for a few more days nice and cool for a change
7162560 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why
7162561 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7162562 hillary clinton has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care
7162563 its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7162564 you know what i got 5 innings out of him thats a gift let me take him out now
7162565 i just think any of the other 29 teams would have handled it a lot better
7162566 what follows are the notes i took down while listening the direct quotes ive gone back and checked word for word the rest are just quick notes on the interview
7162567 the way that they dealt handled everything with the way they kinda like talked to me and my family i just think any of the other 29 teams would have handled it a lot better
7162568 honestly id would prefer if he stayed away from him drafted someone else and decided to go with other players wide
7162569 im not a zealot im not planning on raiding any factories im not planning on setting my troopers on the highway looking for illegals
7162570 but i will in the performance of duties have troopers follow through on an arrest
7162571 we do not have a policy procedure or habit of checking the immigration status of people who call the police
7162572 we do not run witnesses complainants or victims we cant operate that way if you do that are you going to get the help you need in the community
7162573 were not looking for illegals on the basis of being illegal were looking for criminals
7162574 the people from their own nationality dont want the criminals here they want the white picket fence and the american dream
7162575 were not proactively doing immigrant raids or searching out people as if were the federal immigration police
7162576 police across this country have been spending years in the community policing environment working to develop trust with the community so they will report crime to us our job is to fight crime but if we encounter you having committed a criminal act then we want to know everything about you
7162577 our obligation to the feds ends when we notify them weve arrested an alien for a crime
7162578 we dont have the resources for you to focus on non criminal activity
7162579 often in gang settings they dont rise to the level of federal prosecution
7162580 well tell them let us use our immigration authority well check on their status if they have criminal convictions well target them get them off the streets of their communities

7162583 no hay reglas ni en el amor ni en la guerra
7162584 the message that has to be broadcast loud and clear is unity that barack obama is the only candidate who can move the nation forward
7162585 we are spending billions of dollars every month on the war in iraq we are building roads and schools and firehouses over there
7162586 we need a president who is focused on building schools and fixing roads and bridges in rhode island
7162587 the message i got was that the labor community is behind barack obama i love hillary clinton and i think she would make a terrific president but this election is far too important to think about the past
7162588 we need to do everything we can for barack obama we need a president who is for education not bombs
7162589 this will give hillary supporters a chance to honor her historic candidacy and the 18 million voters who voted for her
7162590 i think this is going to be a really contentious election season
7162591 it is going to take the dedication sense of purpose and the energy of michael phelps to win this thing
7162592 we need to come out of the convention not only unified but energized
7162593 we need to be organized and work really hard on baracks campaign
7162594 we need people not only to work in rhode island but to be willing to go to new hampshire and really get involved
7162595 rhode island was one of the smallest delegations but it was also the most dense it seemed like twice as many people were crammed into the delegate seats as there were delegates
7162596 everybody always asks how did rhode island get so many people on the floor ill never tell
7162597 this isnt going to be like los angeles in 2000 or boston last time
7162598 in denver were going to have to follow the rules

7162609 but because he is a realist he believes it is far better to take such actions with the support of our friends and allies

7162624 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7162625 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7162626 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7162627 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7162628 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7162629 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7162630 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7162631 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7162632 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7162633 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7162634 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7162635 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7162636 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7162637 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7162638 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7162639 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7162640 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7162641 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7162642 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7162643 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7162644 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7162645 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7162646 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7162647 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7162648 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7162649 who are open to doing something on the production side
7162650 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7162651 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7162652 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7162653 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7162654 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7162655 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7162656 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7162657 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7162658 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7162659 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7162660 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7162661 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7162662 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7162663 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7162664 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7162665 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7162666 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7162667 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7162668 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7162669 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7162670 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7162671 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7162672 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7162673 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7162674 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7162675 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7162676 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7162677 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7162678 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7162679 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7162680 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7162681 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7162682 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7162683 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7162684 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7162685 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7162686 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7162687 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7162688 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7162689 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7162690 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7162691 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7162692 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7162693 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7162694 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7162695 isnt there something we can do to better prepare 1st year teachers
7162696 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7162697 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7162698 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7162699 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7162700 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7162701 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7162702 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7162703 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7162704 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7162705 get two sets very hard to find these recordings anywhere you wont regret it

7162709 planned parenthood is definitely involved in more than abortion its also deeply invested in sexualizing the youngest of our children so that theyll be lifelong dependents on planned parenthoods lucrative contraceptive and sexually transmitted disease services as well
7162710 this is part of an orchestrated effort to get the community to accept an organization that is inherently disgusting and despicable
7162711 planned parenthoods master advertisers can dress it up all they want but the truth will still prevail planned parenthood wants to get your kids hooked on sex and then rake in the abortion and contraceptive profits
7162712 the a word campaign and the take care down there web site are part of a larger national trend planned parenthood wants your kids and is willing to invest big in marketing promiscuity pornography and sex products to get them
7162713 time is what keeps everything fom happening all at once

7162716 and a notion of nirvana as we might expect to hear it in pasb discussion

7162720 who would be seen dead in most of the outfits it has on display especially that dreadful looking furry jacket
7162721 i have just spent almost 1 500 in that shop and at the top of the list is the furry jacket
7162722 but it looks foreign and i am not going to eat it
7162723 you wont eat aubergine but you have no hesitation in drinking snake wine
7162724 i think those two women i nodded in the direction of the very swank sydney twosome are on the same tour as you
7162725 ill bloody well go and make myself known to them
7162726 they really arent my type at all in fact i dont think they have anything in common with me
7162727 i suppose you are wondering why i am sitting with you
7162728 but as mormons you must understand that in australia your disciples always knock on my door at the most inopportune times this is payback time and i am exacting my revenge

7162730 his grandfather died and he left the team he played in the futures game and that took him away from the team then he went to the olympic team
7162731 huff throws 90 93 with ease he repeats the same delivery and has 3 4 pitches he can use

7162734 when you consume ordinary noodles made from wheat or corn you may soon feel your stomach empty but this soybean noodle delays such a feeling of hunger
7162735 let me start off by saying that in 2000 i said vote for me im an agent of change in 2004 i said im not interested in change i want to continue as president every candidate has got to say change thats what the american people expect
7162736 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7162737 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7162738 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7162739 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7162740 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7162741 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7162742 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7162743 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7162744 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7162745 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7162746 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7162747 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7162748 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7162749 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7162750 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7162751 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7162752 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7162753 bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all
7162754 i longed to gather you like a hen gathers her chicks but you were not willing
7162755 god gave them a spirit of stupor eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear down to this very day

7162759 you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive
7162760 are you implying that christ only wants some people to be saved where does he say that
7162761 our lord was crucified by the nice people who held that religion was all right in its place so long as its place was not here where it might demand of them a change of heart the gravest error of the nice people in all ages is the denial of sin
7162762 i would not recommend buying cash dinar at this point buying at a premium and add on the increasing possibility you will have exchange for a fee means profits will be hard to come by

7162765 that led me to publish pgp electronically for free that year shortly before the measure was defeated after vigorous protest by civil libertarians and industry groups
7162766 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime
7162767 authorize the to pick and choose crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs and associations
7162768 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill sent up was my bill
7162769 states to place social security numbers on and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
7162770 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7162771 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7162772 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7162773 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7162774 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7162775 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7162776 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7162777 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7162778 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7162779 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations
7162780 crimes dangerous to the life limb and well being of minor children
7162781 at least one in person medical evaluation of the patient
7162782 the chairman will be required to hold this meeting in this largest room in the capitol and there will be lines wandering all the way down to the white house
7162783 most said were not hard enough and that tougher enforcement would bring up property values
7162784 a lot of people dont get off work until 5 p m this would make city hall more accessible
7162785 what would you like to see changed about polk city
7162786 they dont seem to understand that the november centennial is a very significant event
7162787 it was an insult to the olympic vision to the spirit of taekwondo and for me an insult to mankind
7162788 their response was we are a hosting country and believing in sportsmanship we are willing to accept any outcome from the decision
7162789 it showed a great cooperative effort between our department the illinois state police division of crime scene services and the knox county states attorneys office to put this whole thing together
7162790 we just make the chips we dont write the software contact hp

7162793 too many sports careers have been cut short when people have constantly looked back at the past inviting negative thoughts of failures rather than success
7162794 the table tennis ball with a 40 mm circumference appears like a football to my eye during the game
7162795 i just tossed and turned i didnt even try to sleep thinking i would sleep after the game
7162796 at the end of the day you just have to face your stressful situation with courage there is no magic pill to counter stress
7162797 badly handled stress that led me to be totally out of sync
7162798 it helped me connect with myself and concentrate on the present
7162799 in fast and high contact games such as football there is no time to think you just have to kick the ball thats coming at you
7162800 theres always a casino near a tournament site and people from my game are always near a bar or club
7162801 some claim to have clocked a better time than they actually did leaving competitors in a mess
7162802 if you dont shout at a player from punjab he wont perform but do the same thing to a maharashtra player and hell forget his game
7162803 the best way to handle stress is to be well prepared stress begins with being unprepared
7162804 when i was young i could just jump off the bed and play the game but as you get older and maybe wiser you start preparing much more
7162805 its like preparing for an exam and fearing youll be asked questions on a chapter you chose not to study
7162806 just five minutes before a game you feel like youve swallowed fire but that is good if you have this feeling that everything is fine things go terribly wrong
7162807 why are you mentioning hrithik here ach bhai hrithik bahut bada star hai
7162808 if he reached the uk late it was because there was a systems failure and his visa got delayed even celina jaitley reached late but nobody is reporting that
7162809 he couldnt stay back in london because those dates werent with us they were with abbas mustan who are producing the rumi jaffry film but they just wouldnt budge they were so adamant about not parting with their dates that govinda had no choice but to fly back to mumbai

7162814 the way the league has evolved thats what gives you the competitive edge
7162815 im a big believer in trying to identify what your customer is interested in
7162816 and for us its the fan the community and the shareholders how can we give fans and also our partners from a sponsorship standpoint better access to the things they are interested in

7162821 you know there was all that water out on riverside avenue and down by the river all down that way but thankfully it drained out pretty good
7162822 i dont know about you but its nice to see a little sunshine today in jacksonville fla fickle fay is out of our lives
7162823 utility outages and downed trees are the biggest concerns we still have 50 000 residents without power and jea is working productively in this weather so were looking to see restoration relatively quickly
7162824 the roof collapsed yesterday we came home to check on our houses thieves had broke in and took dvds tvs vcrs babys milk
7162825 water was rising up toward the bottom of their house it doesnt look like it was close to entering the house but they didnt have a way to get out their cars had been moved to higher ground we sent one of our rescue boats in to remove the children
7162826 weve been here since the early morning hours when we had to actually go in and physically rescue some people out of their residences with our small marine unit
7162827 the water is ranging anywhere from a foot deep to as much as it looks like 5 feet deep thats pretty bad
7162828 the carpet is gone the flooring is floating theres waste everywhere in the house it stinks there are fish in the house if you walk through the water there are ants everywhere its nasty its ridiculous in there
7162829 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7162830 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7162831 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7162832 following damage to the optic nerve retinal ganglion cells the projection neurons of the eye normally fail to regenerate their axons and soon begin to die
7162833 following injury to the nervous system the activation of macrophages microglia and t cells profoundly affects the ability of neurons to survive and to regenerate damaged axons
7162834 weve had a long standing relationship with the burners community for years
7162835 we have 14 parking spaces fenced off weve got pallets of water tons of water four truckloads
7162836 thats outside inside we have everything conducive to burners its grab and go food things like that
7162837 weve watched the international contingent that travels through the airport for this event and it has grown through the years theyre a large group that comes to the region and spends money while theyre here so we want them to keep coming back
7162838 its pretty funny because in the past weve actually had cashiers wearing santa hats
7162839 its pretty much the beer of the college crowd these days plus its cheap
7162840 i personally had one on the playa and it tastes great when its hot but it doesnt taste so good when you drink it in town

7162859 released a heavily biased report with a sweeping pro abortion conclusion based upon one solitary study to the detriment of american womens health
7162860 the apa needs to hear from you that a new more scientifically based report is needed
7162861 any research needs to be broader in scope and include studies that this report ignored
7162862 that have highlighted the high prevalence of women affected by repeat abortions or studies that have shown an equally high number of women in the u s who have felt coerced into their abortions
7162863 there is a growing body of testimony from real women who have suffered from abortion
7162864 according to the planned parenthood federation of americas own web site planned parenthood promotes comprehensive sex eduation as opposed to abstinence until marriage
7162865 note that planned parenthoods definition of abstinence is one of personal control abstain from sex only if and when you want to sexual activity of any kind with any one is fine
7162866 but the virtue of chastity is the true choice for sexual wholeness purity and virginity for the unmarried and sexual intimacy treasured as a god given gift for within a marriage
7162867 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7162868 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7162869 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7162870 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7162871 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7162872 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7162873 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7162874 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that

7162888 that show was the first thing to make me proud to be a wrestling fan in a long time
7162889 its becoming time to give some credit to the in ring efforts of mark henry
7162890 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
7162891 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
7162892 this is the worst wrestling show i have seen in a long time with booking that defies all logic and common sense

7162897 creo que hoy hay tel fono pudieron llamar al profesor el profesionalismo dice
7162898 el malentendido pudo darse cuando llegas y te vas a tu casa pero existe cuando no te comunicas con el preparador f sico porque hay muchos jugadores que vienen trabajando en el gimnasio en la tarde para mi el jugador cometi un error y tiene que justificarse porque es de selecci n no puedes dar un ejemplo como ese
7162899 el martes habr n hecho muy poco mi rcoles nada jueves nada si son un poquito profesional te entra en la cabeza solito
7162900 nosotros no hemos podido hablar con l la volpe pero estamos a la disposici n de l lo que queremos es trabajar y estar bien con el entrenador fue un malentendido porque a nosotros nos dieron unas rdenes y siempre hemos respetado no somos jugadores indisciplinados
7162901 this has been the easiest campaign ive ever run in
7162902 i havent had to game anything for real i know what i believe i know what i want to do and im just comfortable saying it and laying it out there
7162903 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7162904 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7162905 the american people dont give a darn about any of this stuff thats going on up here
7162906 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11
7162907 the thing i hated i was this tragic young figure
7162908 someone will stand up and say well ive lost this and ive lost that and you guys dont understand
7162909 and i say look i was a single parent for five years and i understand what its like
7162910 denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7162911 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7162912 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7162913 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7162914 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7162915 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7162916 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7162917 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7162918 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7162919 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7162920 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7162921 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7162922 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7162923 i travel all over the state and people dont realize all the state has to offer
7162924 it allowed the community to see and talk to these agencies ask questions and get immediate answers
7162925 just traveling throughout the community you see the tremendous need for job opportunities work force training and access to health care
7162926 and now its culturally pervasive if youre not doing two things at once youre somehow less than worthy
7162927 the dangers of consistently multitasking are never feeling as if you are totally in control of what youre doing and its internally stressful
7162928 one day you wake up and realize you have crossed the line between human being and human doing
7162929 try the art of doing one thing at a time a few times a week
7162930 youd be amazed sometimes of how rewarding it can feel
7162931 it is a constant challenge for me to consciously choose to compartmentalize these multiple tasks
7162932 i have to give myself permission to focus on one project
7162933 because of that im doing many things but im doing them better
7162934 texting myspace thats their life thats what they know thats what they use thats how they communicate
7162935 for them this isnt a new or different way of doing it thats what they know
7162936 as far as we know its not an issue in kankakee at this point
7162937 this is certainly not going to stop anyone from getting bullied we have plenty of laws on the books
7162938 theres a thing called an off and on button if someones bullying your child turn the computer off
7162939 were speculating the earthquake had something to do with it
7162940 were speculating the earthquake had something to do with it
7162941 when i first started here in march there were only around 100 homes that we were having problems getting meter readings on
7162942 most of those have been changed out and have had their billing issues resolved
7162943 notified customers by letter and phone about the need to schedule time for the free meter to be installed
7162944 my monthly bills have continued to be erratic and incomplete and i have had problems getting a detailed copy of the bill from aqua
7162945 i finally got credit for an overpayment on my july billing that aqua had denied for months
7162946 we still have to change out all the old meters in town
7162947 we are not taking readings from both the old and new meters we wont be continuing that indefinitely because it is just not cost efficient
7162948 no one likes to be shut off but unfortunately thats the only tool we have to get this project completed
7162949 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time you cant change america when you believe that in the bush administration weve made great progress economically you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7162950 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7162951 at this defining moment in our history with our nation at war and our economy in recession we know that the american people cannot afford four more years of the same failed policies and the same old politics in washington we know that the time for change has come
7162952 this is where hes pivoting the success of his primary effort is now over now theyve got to go on and go after the white house
7162953 theres always that concern of am i giving it the best attention
7162954 adults have an advantage to some degree because they do have the mature part of the brain now to rank order in importance and pull back
7162955 for most kids a little multitasking isnt going to kill them but if it becomes the dominant style they use to do homework and study then it will affect them and they wont be able to compete

7162977 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7162978 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy

7163000 unfounded charges of anti jewish sentiments not only malign the innocent they also create a boy who cried wolf syndrome in that they may well render society insensitive to real bigotry when it does come along i have known chris ferrara and michael matt for many years the notion that they hate jews is so absurd as to be beneath contempt
7163001 it is time for us to recognize the charge of anti semitism for what it often is a political weapon intended to silence critics of liberalism

7163008 ne is led to believe that not only did the people writing the report have no pre existing familiarity with the traditionalist movement but that in all likelihood not a single one of them was a catholic
7163009 the greatest fault of the splc report is its lumping all traditionalists into the anti semitism category there are some authentically anti semitic people within catholic traditionalism but i also know that they are not representative of the movement
7163010 i have a suggestion perhaps the splc could use a small portion of its substantial endowment to fund an investigatory team consisting of catholics who know the church its history and the faith and who know how to conduct an investigation that will end up being factually correct

7163016 having beguiled the jews by the lying signs and wonders of his magical deceit until they believe he is the expected christ he shall afterwards be characterized by all manner of wicked deeds of inhumanity and lawlessness as if to outdo all the unjust and impious men who have gone before him

7163031 from anti semitic teachings what anti semitic teachings and the idea of forcing its view of the world on unbelievers

7163041 a clear conversion to doctrinal orthodoxy after the frightening abandonments following the council and i hold a return also to adoration therefore also a return to the bimillenial liturgy of the church
7163042 the disaster the actual cultural destruction represented by the prohibition of the liturgy of saint pius v and the disappearance of latin as sacred language of the catholic church
7163043 the effects were disastrous the road to incredible abuses in the liturgy was opened
7163044 the mainstream traditionalist movement is right about so much about nearly everything one is tempted to say but it is plagued with a few malcontents whose understanding of doctrine and liturgy is proportionate to their docility and sweet temperedness
7163045 a continuing process of decay that has gone on largely on the basis of appeals to the council
7163046 if the world hates you know that it has hated me before you if you had been of the world the world would love its own but because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hates you

7163067 in the meantime the people of god have a firm mandate to further exodus along the route mapped out by the second vatican council
7163068 unless we are blind we must even state bluntly that what we see looks less like the hoped for regeneration of catholicism than its accelerated decomposition
7163069 a former irish carmelite monastery is expected to be turned into a country club style hotel after its sale to a property developer the carmelite order had shut their house in castle martyr cork last year after 73 years because of the downfall in vocations
7163070 the religious orders will soon be virtually non existent in the united states
7163071 we feel we must disagree with those prophets of gloom who are always forecasting disaster as though the end of the world were at hand
7163072 certainly the results of vatican ii seem cruelly opposed to the expectations of everyone beginning with those of pope john xxiii and then of pope paul vi
7163073 a tree which has spread its majestic and mighty branches over the vineyard of the lord
7163074 it has given us many fruits in these 35 years of life and it will give us many more in the years to come
7163075 i am convinced that the crisis in the church that we are experiencing is to a large extent due to the disintegration of the liturgy
7163076 see p 37 in his address to the bishops of chile on july 13 1988 the cardinal explained
7163077 the declared enemies of god and his church heretics and schismatics must be criticized as much as possible as long as truth is not denied it is a work of charity to shout here is the wolf when it enters the flock or anywhere else
7163078 in the third secret of fatima it is foretold among other things that the great apostasy in the church will begin at the top
7163079 the church will be punished because the majority of her members high and low will become so perverted the church will sink deeper and deeper until she will at last seem to be extinguished and the succession of peter and the other apostles to have expired but after this she will be victoriously exalted in the sight of all doubters
7163080 in our time more than ever before the chief strength of the wicked lies in the cowardice and weakness of good men all the strength of satans reign is due to the easy going weakness of catholics oh if i might ask the divine redeemer as the prophet zachary did in spirit what are those wounds in the midst of thy hands the answer would not be doubtful with these was i wounded in the house of them that loved me i was wounded by my friends who did nothing to defend me and who on every occasion made themselves the accomplices of my adversaries and this reproach can be levelled at the weak and timid catholics of all countries
7163081 the apostles and their successors are gods vicars in governing the church which is built on faith and the sacraments of faith wherefore just as they may not institute another church so neither may they deliver another faith nor institute other sacraments
7163082 i hear around me reformers who want to dismantle the holy sanctuary destroy the universal flame of the church to discard all her adornments and smite her with remorse for her historic past
7163083 pope gelasius in his ninth letter chap 26 to the bishops of lucania condemned the evil practice which had been introduced of women serving the priest at the celebration of mass since this abuse had spread to the greeks innocent iv strictly forbade it in his letter to the bishop of tusculum women should not dare to serve at the altar they should be altogether refused this ministry we too have forbidden this practice in the same words
7163084 on december 8 1869 the international congress of freemasons imposed it as a duty on all its members to do all in their power to wipe out catholicity from the face of the earth
7163085 it is impossible to approve in catholic publications a style inspired by unsound novelty which seems to deride the piety of the faithful and dwells on the introduction of a new order of christian life on new directions of the church on new aspirations of the modern soul on a new social vocation of the clergy on a new christian civilization and many other things of the same kind
7163086 the great movement of apostasy being organized in every country for the establishment of a one world church which shall have neither dogmas nor hierarchy neither discipline for the mind nor curb for the passions and which under the pretext of freedom and human dignity would bring back to the world if such a church could overcome the reign of legalized cunning and force and the oppression of the weak and of all those who toil and suffer indeed the true friends of the people are neither revolutionaries nor innovators they are traditionalists
7163087 when other christian bodies are licensing as preachers young men who have abandoned the foundations of christian belief the church would rather face the threatened defection of thousands of minds reputed brilliant or learned than sacrifice one iota of the truth confided to her by her founder
7163088 commonly supposed to have been at the time the governing center of european freemasonry
7163089 the goal of freemasonry is no longer the destruction of the church but to make use of it by infiltrating it
7163090 in our ranks the soldier dies and the struggle goes on
7163091 tear off the mask from freemasonry and make plain to all what it really is
7163092 the pope whoever he is will never come to the secret societies it is up to the secret societies to take the first step toward the church with the aim of conquering both of them
7163093 the task that we are going to undertake is not the work of a day or of a month or of a year it may last several years perhaps a century but in our ranks the soldier dies and the struggle goes on
7163094 we do not intend to win the popes to our cause to make them neophytes of our principles propagators of our ideas
7163095 with that we shall march more securely towards the assault on the church than with the pamphlets of our brethren in france and even the gold of england
7163096 we have no doubt that we will arrive at this supreme end of our efforts
7163097 now then to assure ourselves a pope of the required dimensions it is a question first of shaping him
7163098 this reputation will put access to our doctrines into the midst of the young clergy as well as deeply into the monasteries
7163099 in the path that we are laying out for our brethren there are found great obstacles to conquer difficulties of more than one kind to master
7163100 a school cannot remain neutral between the syllabus and the declaration of the rights of man
7163101 that which i fear is not the commune of paris no that which i fear is liberal catholicism
7163102 the existence of profound differences in the midst of the episcopacy itself cannot be concealed they run the risk of giving place to discussions that will be prolonged indefinitely
7163103 this mentality can incline certain fathers to present motions to introduce methods incompatible with catholic traditions
7163104 the worst enemies of the church the modernists who are already getting ready as certain indications show to bring forth the revolution in the church a new 1789
7163105 the new church which might not be able to retain anything of scholastic doctrine and the original form of the former church will nevertheless receive consecration and canonical jurisdiction from rome
7163106 that the divine cult in the form directed by the liturgy ceremonial ritual and regulations of the roman church will shortly undergo a transformation at an ecumenical council which will restore to it the venerable simplicity of the golden age of the apostles in accordance with the dictates of conscience and modern civilization
7163107 a perfect accord between the ideals of modern civilization and the ideal of christ and his gospel this will be the consecration of the new social order and the solemn baptism of modern civilization
7163108 there is a sacrifice in the offing which represents a solemn act of expiation the papacy will fall it will die under the hallowed knife which the fathers of the last council will forge the papal caesar is a host victim crowned for the sacrifice
7163109 we need a council and a pope to proclaim it
7163110 a few years ago this was still inconceivable to us but today
7163111 false opinions which threaten to undermine the foundations of catholic doctrine
7163112 if they elect roncalli everything would be saved he would be capable of calling a council and of consecrating ecumenism
7163113 theologians and biblical scholars who had been under a cloud for years surfaced as periti theological experts advising the bishops at the council and their post vatican ii books and commentaries became popular reading
7163114 pope pius xiis encyclical humani generis had a devastating effect on the work of a number of pre conciliar theologians
7163115 during the early preparation of the council those theologians mainly french with some germans whose activities had been restricted by pope pius xii were still under a cloud
7163116 we have used ambiguous phrases during the council and we know how we will interpret them afterwards
7163117 one can say that ecumenism is the legitimate son of freemasonry
7163118 something has changed within the church and replies given by the pope to the most urgent questions such as priestly celibacy and birth control are hotly debated within the church itself the word of the sovereign pontiff is questioned by bishops by priests by the faithful
7163119 we had struggled for a century and a half to bring our opinions to prevail with the church and had not succeeded
7163120 it cannot be denied that the affirmation of religious liberty by vatican ii says materially something other than what the syllabus of 1864 said and even just about the opposite of propositions 16 17 and 19 of this document
7163121 if it is desirable to offer a diagnosis of the text guadium et spes as a whole we might say that in conjunction with the texts on religious liberty and world religions it is a revision of the syllabus of pius ix a kind of counter syllabus let us be content to say here that the text serves as a counter syllabus and as such represent on the part of the church an attempt at an official reconciliation with the new era inaugurated in 1789
7163122 i was relieved when we were told that this council was not aiming at defining or giving final statements on doctrine because a statement on doctrine has to be very carefully formulated and i would have regarded the council documents as tentative and liable to be reformed
7163123 we have to distinguish according to the schemas and the chapters those which have already been the subject of dogmatic definitions in the past as for the decelerations which have a novel character we have to make reservations
7163124 given the councils pastoral character it avoided pronouncing in an extraordinary manner dogmas endowed with the note of infallibility
7163125 we must remember that if all the manifestly good men were on one side and all the manifestly bad men were on the other there would be no danger of anyone least of all the elect being deceived by lying wonders
7163126 the churchs negative judgement in regard to masonic associations remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden the faithful who enroll in masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive communion
7163127 two loves formed two cities the love of self reaching even to contempt of god an earthly city and the love of god reaching to contempt of self a heavenly one
7163128 for lo thy enemies have made a noise and they that hate thee have lifted up the head they have taken a malicious counsel against thy people and they have consulted against thy saints they have said come and let us destroy them so that they be not a nation ps 81 24
7163129 men think or would have it believed that christian teaching is not suited to the good of the state for they wish the state to be founded not on solid virtue but on the impunity of vice
7163130 im not the guy no one believed him just as no one believed him when he said of the vice presidential slot last year
7163131 no one knows better than me the passion and dedication my father brings to everything he does from his love for our family to his commitment to our state and his leadership in the senate
7163132 he will bring the same passion to the fight for change at this critical time in our history

7163140 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the 150 000 200 000 range for a day
7163141 plus jet and other v i p arrangements on the ground
7163142 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 range for a series of talks
7163143 quando vi o fogo perto de casa a minha primeira reac o foi tirar a mangueira e come ar a lutar pelas minhas coisas
7163144 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7163145 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7163146 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7163147 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7163148 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7163149 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7163150 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7163151 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7163152 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7163153 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7163154 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7163155 report on the deteriorating security situation as well as the food crisis
7163156 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7163157 they wanted a provocation at sea but they wont get it
7163158 we didnt have anybody famous it was old fashioned people power we just wanted to show what happens when ordinary people from around the world get together to try breaking this immoral siege on gaza
7163159 we never intended for this to be a humanitarian mission its about human rights in gaza
7163160 hes still able to turn his legs over fast enough with high power
7163161 he overcomes his average start and just doesnt slow down as others do in the last 30 to 40 meters hes able to relax and coordinate his longer legs
7163162 no one can really know exactly how fast a human may be able to run
7163163 we have no way of knowing if humans might not have been even faster centuries or millennia ago
7163164 you want to pick somebody who complements you and strengthens you

7163328 stuey and im not defending him but he probably isnt aware with how serious the ffa and the referees are about verbal challenges to their decisions because he hasnt been here
7163329 as much you can talk to them about it unless someone actually experiences and sees something its a bit harder to absorb
7163330 but he knows well and truly how its going to be in the future and his head is down because he had a good game

7163342 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
7163343 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
7163344 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
7163345 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
7163346 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
7163347 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
7163348 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
7163349 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
7163350 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
7163351 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7163352 this is the biggest party of the dnc this is denvers night
7163353 weve had riot police asking to use our bathroom all day

7163358 after the pga i had a family vacation my kids and i and some friends we went down to a lake in southern utah and just didnt have a razor

7163362 el equipo no se descompuso a pesar de haber quedado en desventaja y pienso que deber a haber ganado porque hizo todo el gasto del partido
7163363 estuvieron muy aplicados en el dispositivo defensivo y a nosotros nos falt creatividad para romper eso no estuvimos finos y algunos no tuvieron el nivel de otros partidos pero el equipo tuvo un volument tremendo y atac por todos lados
7163364 of course no one would want to live that way
7163365 tienen algo que decir necesito su apoyo est n listos
7163366 we are playing catch up now because we have lost this game but we have to cope and bounce back in the next game on wednesday
7163367 we need a top class performance then because today was simply not good enough
7163368 its a disappointment fulham started stronger than us and they were sharper especially in the first half they didnt create many chances if you look at the whole game but they took advantage from a corner
7163369 we tried to come back but we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes we didnt keep calm in and around the box
7163370 we lacked a bit more quality in our passing than normal and if you look at how much possession we had that shows that technical quality is important as well
7163371 fulham have a good midfield and we werent at our best today the passing was not as good as it could be today either and that applied to every area
7163372 we couldnt afford a mistake in a game like this if we had gone to half time 0 0 i believe we would have won the game
7163373 you always regret matches where youre not at your best of course but now we need to bounce back
7163374 i dont really go in for game plans we just set out to enjoy ourselves and to play
7163375 we doubled up when they had the ball in order to squeeze their space and when we were attacking we wanted to be as up tempo and quick with our passing and movement as arsenal normally are
7163376 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7163377 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7163378 have without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7163379 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7163380 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7163381 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7163382 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence watch as they drive around in hummers
7163383 we suggest that peoples willingness to take psychological enhancements will largely depend on beliefs about whether those enhancements will alter characteristics considered fundamental to self identity

7163385 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that
7163386 we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
7163387 im well on the record as never having approved of either margaret thatchers social or economic policies thats clear if you look at the interview
7163388 i was commenting on why scots in particular were so deeply resentful of margaret thatcher and i strongly believe that her social message of no such thing as society and the poll tax cut against the grain of scotlands social conscience
7163389 that doesnt mean that the nation liked her economic policies just that we liked her social policies even less

7163394 this investigation is a further illustration of the value of dna evidence to police investigators
7163395 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7163396 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7163397 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7163398 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7163399 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7163400 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7163401 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7163402 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7163403 zorg dat je steeds het nummer van de politie in je mobieltje hebt geprogrammeerd om in ieder geval melding van misstanden te maken

7163645 there are still things we need to be a lot better at but for the first real game we played well and definitely improved on our exhibition performance
7163646 its great to start the season off with a win
7163647 we have a lot of really good attacking players and thats exciting some teams have one or two main players that score but we have several including midfielders who can contribute goals
7163648 john romeros about to make you his bitch suck it down
7163649 if dyack cant deliver on his promises then hes going to regret it
7163650 what was done by the individual or individuals was horrible
7163651 but responsibility also lies with the schools board first and foremost they should have caught this stuff
7163652 as far as the board was concerned everything was kosher until june
7163653 i drop off the rent check at the shakopee house
7163654 when your director shows up in an escalade or a hummer you notice
7163655 told me he was worth 2 7 million i said wow congratulations to you just a few years ago i heard he was struggling really bad i heard he had a part time job at a super 8
7163656 my father used to say that my brother likes to tell false things all the time he told me to be careful of that
7163657 i just hope that these allegations are false and what hes saying is true
7163658 if not then hes been misleading me and a lot of other people for a long long time

7163674 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7163675 well theres nothing i have to say about that i love my daughter very much but you know i lost and i lost big time in boston
7163676 but here we go into an area that we cant
7163677 there is some disagreement as to who was supposed to take care of the legalities of the wedding the marriage
7163678 i had never never thought of becoming a father and then suddenly this little bundle came along
7163679 and everyone always told me that this will change your life going forward i always thought no it cant but it did it clearly clearly positively did and it made a huge huge impact on me it was a life changing experience
7163680 unfortunately i have no access to it at the moment
7163681 the dining table in the evening and everyone is tired and somewhat bored and the discussion is not really going anywhere
7163682 there was not one single positive line about me in the report nothing nothing whatsoever even witnesses who had testified on my behalf apparently gave negative testimony on me
7163683 this is a terrible report weve lost there is nothing you can do
7163684 sandras sole focus is on the health well being and safety of her daughter reigh in light of mr gerhartsreiters history of deceitful behavior any statements made by him should be viewed with extreme skepticism
7163685 its an absolutely fascinating story as to why zionism had its birth
7163686 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7163687 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7163688 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7163689 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7163690 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7163691 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7163692 you never hear the specifics for his connections to tony rezko
7163693 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7163694 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7163695 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7163696 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7163697 a new iman arrives in a sleepy parish and the comedy arrives from the misunderstandings that causes but the lawyers said it might be culturally insensitive
7163698 the vast majority of muslims are able to have a laugh at themselves just like everyone else why should they be excluded from comedy its funny that itv had no problem with a new sketch about a pregnant jesuss girlfriend who has to deal with dating the son of god
7163699 to seek to lower the climate change risk by substantially slowing the rise in living standards anywhere least of all in developing countries
7163700 it is comprehensive in coverage and immediate in impact as companies pass on the new costs to consumers
7163701 no jewish islamic christian states anywhere in the world just good robust secular democracies
7163702 by speaking out on behalf of the palestinians and lebanese people we can give voice to those that some governments and media would wish to silence
7163703 looking back i think i just bought the prevailing polemic on campus at the time that israel was some sort of quasi theocracy having explored the subject more deeply since then i understand this is nonsense
7163704 i realise i just misunderstood obviously the state of israel is not a state for the jewish religion but a homeland for the jewish people
7163705 its a really robust democracy there are plenty of non jewish people in israel who have full citizenship rights
7163706 if there is discrimination its no worse than what would happen in australia or america or anywhere else i completely support israels right to exist as a jewish state
7163707 it would have been very easy for ms jackson to go along with the anti semitism of the far left when she was president of the nus
7163708 instead she chose the politically unpopular and risky path of speaking out against the anti semitism of the far left and she deserves credit for that
7163709 most hospitals never pay their bills for months and most of the suppliers are too scared to create problems because they are threatened with losing their contracts
7163710 we are a small business and we do need cash flow
7163711 its frustrating having to chase money especially when i give them goods and they get money back on the same day
7163712 its the lowest of the low for a big government agency to make suppliers hold out for payment of services and goods that they have supplied
7163713 its mean and its jeopardising some of those small businesses that have to pay their bills and staff on time they struggle to stay afloat
7163714 now we have put them on pre pay so they pay in advance
7163715 our findings highlight a risk associated with alcohol dependence in women that is not widely recognised a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
7163716 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
7163717 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and opportunity to have children may be impaired
7163718 tarras has several tracks that would fit right into an rpg
7163719 you should definitely mention hevia a spanish bagpiper who has made five albums
7163720 ive only heard the first two albums but the music is very suikoden ish and although it concentrates mostly on bagpipe there are other instruments as well

7163736 our data indicates that the transformers have yet to capture that key octogenarian demographic maybe we should add an old robot to the mix
7163737 okay but only if we can name him after an athletic supporter
7163738 we left soundwave out because we wanted more time to do it right hell be in the sequel
7163739 for every opinion there is an equally rabid opposing opinion
7163740 if you can imagine it there is porn of it
7163741 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak
7163742 hmm tsk anyway hey patulong naman kumuha ng pictures puhleezzz please

7163756 do you want me to go outside and pick you up myself
7163757 it actually makes you float it feels like youre getting ready to take off
7163758 its really become like the star of swimming right now
7163759 its not so fair in my opinion because its very expensive technology its for a rich country
7163760 i think its hard to tell because this pool is bullet fast i dont think you can say the suits made everyone faster they certainly contributed
7163761 but if you think its 100 per cent attributable to the performance movement in swimming then you are underestimating the work the coaches and the swimmers put in
7163762 you put on a suit that you know has broken so many world records you are going to be fast
7163763 to break that many records there has to be technology
7163764 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7163765 if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7163766 it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
7163767 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7163768 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the us of america joe biden
7163769 my friends i dont have to tell you this election year the choice is clear one man stands ready to deliver change we desperately need a man im proud to call my friend a man who will be the next president of the united states barack america
7163770 a man who will be the next president of the united states barack amer you know you learn a lot of things being up close with a guy
7163771 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous my wife jill who youll meet soon she also has her doctorate degree which is a problem
7163772 but all kidding aside my jill my jill my wife jill and i are honored to join barack and michelle on this journey because thats what it is its a journey
7163773 tony rezko and his partner daniel mahru had rehabbed the 31 unit building in englewood with a loan from chicago taxpayers
7163774 their buildings were falling apart said a former city official
7163775 they just didnt pay attention to the condition of these buildings
7163776 the senator relatively inexperienced in this kind of work was assigned to tasks appropriate for a junior lawyer according to an e mail from obama spokesman robert gibbs
7163777 these tasks would have included reviewing documents collecting corporate organizational documents and drafting corporate resolutions
7163778 senator obama does not remember having conversations with tony rezko about properties that he owned or any specific issues related to those properties
7163779 to celebrate the first of what im sure will be
7163780 people dont want anything to do with ukraine here sevastopol is where we can reconstruct the historical truth and rejoin the whole of russia if moscow wants it will be able to do it because it has the tools here
7163781 we are the cordon that supports the russian fleet we will defend them against the ukrainian bailiffs who want to end the fleets lease in 2017
7163782 ukraine does not respect us and our rights we might have another kosovo we want russia intervention to defend us and after georgia we believe they will defend us
7163783 as long as the fleet is here there will be no problems
7163784 i suspect people in the ukrainian government do not understand the meaning of the fleet for sevastopol the fleet is a protection against everything including nato
7163785 they have destroyed friendly relations with russia they are losers yushchenko is worse than hell
7163786 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible mitcham said
7163787 i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all
7163788 thats it its a silver medal i am so happy with this and then i won i cant believe it im so happy
7163789 i had some very wise words and some very good advice before coming into the 10m competition to just enjoy it have fun and thats what i thought right from the very first dive in the prelims to the very last dive in the final
7163790 i was definitely stressing it to myself just enjoy the moment there is nothing you can do to change whats about to happen so just enjoy it and it worked
7163791 the first dive wasnt the best the third dive wasnt the best but there was nothing i could do about it except just enjoy the moment he said
7163792 i knew that the best diving would come and the next three dives were really good for me
7163793 absoultely everything i have done has been for this mitcham said
7163794 coming back and doing everything that i did was to win an olympic gold medal
7163795 it was his best dive and thats why we put it at the end sobrino said
7163796 the expectancy of that dive was around 106 108 points but not 112 never he did it at the right time at the right moment in the right pool with the right crowd so im pretty happy and we got the right medal
7163797 i have been toying with the idea of staying on and doing some synchro with matt mitcham but im pretty sure thats it for me he said
7163798 full credit to matthew he put on such an awesome job the whole time that we have been here he has been training really well all through the prelims semis and final he just executed how it should be done and walked away with the gold medal helm said
7163799 you gotta admit from a scale from 1 to awsome im dah sh t

7163804 it will be alleged that dna material located at this crime scene matches the dna of the arrested man
7163805 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7163806 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7163807 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7163808 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7163809 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7163810 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7163811 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7163812 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7163813 is obama bashing american dream by bashing mccains 7 homes

7163820 you gotta admit from a scale from 1 to awsome im dah sh t
7163821 the opposite of a correct statement is a false statement but the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth
7163822 democracy is a poor system of government at best the only thing that can honestly be said in its favor is that it is about eight times as good as any other method the human race has ever tried democracys worst faults is that its leaders are likely to reflect the faults and virtues of their constituents a depressingly low level but what else can you expect

7163850 what i find annoying and frustrating is the arguments coming from people overseas they havent been here and been in with the whales
7163851 its not in our interest to harass the animals they are our livelihood
7163852 i found i couldnt tell people about it when i got out of the water
7163853 their beauty their gracefulness the lack of fear in something weve nearly hunted to extinction
7163854 theres just something there that i connected with and ive never found it anywhere else
7163855 some have quite a close encounter and we have no doubt its a fantastic experience and for many a very emotional experience
7163856 it could be argued that if you offer that kind of experience to the general public then youre creating a passion for the whales that could ultimately save the whales
7163857 i fear if that happens again the government might stop it completely
7163858 that you can swim with the whales here is very very important for tourism ive done it once its just an awesome experience
7163859 he probably could play but i do think that he could probably use the time to be on the field and he could probably even get better for us

7163884 hey why do guy like to stick their tongues up girls butts why is that considered hot
7163885 well the vagina is a wonderful thing but it has other stuff you have to think about fiddling with and the asshole well you only have to think about one thing
7163886 yeah there will be no you kissing my mouth directly after you have to disinfect
7163887 do you see yourself living on the east coast or the west coast
7163888 do you think youre gonna give up the drugs when we have kids
7163889 the government of mexico asked us to give the cemex businessmen another chance to see if we can reach an understanding
7163890 but the mexicans of this company have been arrogant very arrogant and we demand respect here buddy
7163891 we want to settle this in a friendly way like we did with the french who stay on here as our partners
7163892 challenged the government and i dont know what else at the meetings
7163893 you know mr president that first and foremost i defend the interests of my homeland the interests of my people not those of businessmen
7163894 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7163895 nothing but dry food from now on i want to see ribs on this dog next time you bring it in
7163896 maam youd eat dry dog food if you were hungry enough
7163897 it will be alleged that dna material located at this crime scene matches the dna of the arrested man
7163898 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7163899 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7163900 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7163901 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7163902 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7163903 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7163904 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7163905 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7163906 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7163907 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7163908 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7163909 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7163910 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7163911 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7163912 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7163913 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7163914 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7163915 whether the cat is black or white makes no difference as long as it catches mice it is a good cat
7163916 life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards
7163917 the driver told me the vehicle got in his lane and he tried to avoid a collision and went to his right and lost control
7163918 i proved to the u s dot that i had new brakes on that bus i was able to show them using invoices
7163919 identification of company officials and functions physical addresses vehicle ownership employee identification and operational similarities
7163920 fmcsa takes its motor coach oversight and safety responsibilities seriously and will continue to investigate carriers with questionable relationships to ensure our orders and regulations are followed to the fullest extent possible
7163921 there is absolutely no tolerance for operators who attempt to game the system at the risk of endangering the traveling public
7163922 i cant believe how good i was skating in practice but how bad i skated when it counted
7163923 i guess this gives me that extra little motivation to skate better on the next two stops if i want to win this thing im stoked for bob but its going to be a good race from here on out
7163924 i knew i had to put together a great third run
7163925 i dont really know what happened but i pulled everything off and im stoked
7163926 i cant believe im up on the podium with bucky and plg these guys are heavy hitters it was a great competition and im thrilled with the victory
7163927 i kind of played it safe in the second run and tried to break it out in the third
7163928 bob just came out swinging and im superpsyched for him
7163929 i have to skate better than i did today if i want to be in the race for the cup
7163930 id like to be in the top three and i need to skate more consistently than i did in this stop
7163931 unfortunately because of the need for lightning fast speeds todays notebooks have a tendency to become very warm youll notice the word laptop has become extinct because they really dont do well on ones lap anymore you should always place your macbook on a hard surface and be careful not to block the vents for proper ventilation
7163932 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgment there were a number of people that took offense to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7163933 cela na pas t aussi difficile que je le craignais j tais un peu nerveuse car on ne s tait pas vues ni parl depuis 14 ans nous sommes toutes les deux des adultes des professionnelles une fois que avions commenc travailler tout allait bien
7163934 no im quite certain that i mean i need x
7163935 you dont have to get pissy with me when all you really need is to accept that you mean you need y
7163936 a disturbing new documentary that will shock anyone who thinks all scientists are free to follow the evidence wherever it may lead
7163937 uncovers a long line of biologists astronomers chemists and philosophers who have had their reputations destroyed and their careers ruined by a scientific establishment that allows absolutely no dissent from charles darwins theory of random mutation and natural selection
7163938 were in not for the fact that in my heart i know for clark adams such a wish has no chance of coming true
7163939 referring to specific and distinguishing predictions of empirical phenomena that follow directly from the claim
7163940 you know guys ive been thinking and i think that atoms are mutable they can be split apart or mashed together
7163941 interesting concept donald but you have no evidence for that
7163942 why dont you show us how darwinist have tested that a fish turned into an amphibian
7163943 the truth is common descent can be independent of the evidence or lack thereof for darwinian evolution aka rm amp ns
7163944 why dont you show us how darwinist have tested that a fish turned into an amphibian
7163945 pixie has absolutely no empirical evidence to demonstrate that a fish has or can turn into an amphibian
7163946 for him and the rest of the world there is only one common descent a theory proposed by darwin and accepted by behe and by me
7163947 heres another viewpoint heres what other scientists say they hold the intelligent design paradigm instead of a darwinian paradigm
7163948 various forms of life that began abruptly through an intelligent agency with their distinctive features intact fish with fins and scales birds with feathers beaks and wings etc
7163949 t he part of kitzmiller that finds id not to be science is unnecessary unconvincing not particularly suited to the judicial role and even perhaps dangerous to both science and freedom of religion
7163950 the honest teacher never directly answers the question of course
7163951 as to the kansas science hearings you can actually listen to deharts own voice in the audio download
7163952 happens to provide a reliable transcript this was all available to you but you refused to look
7163953 dehart did more than introduce the critical articles dehart taught intelligent design more particularly he used the text of pandas and people
7163954 so zachs argument is that the darwinian persecution of dehart is justify because 1 he taught id and 2 he used the book of pandas and people to do it
7163955 if you go down from here now you will have to leave
7163956 kirkuk was founded some 4 500 years ago by the hurrians it was then conquered by the assyrians then it was overrun by the iranians then by the turks then the arabs and now it is part of iraq
7163957 what is jerusalem your christian holy places lie over the jewish temple that the romans pulled down the muslim places of worship lie over yours which is more holy the wall the mosque the sepulchre who has claim no one has claim all have claim
7163958 to introduce a supernatural or transcendental cause within science is to depart from naturalistic explanations on this ground to invoke an intelligent designer or creator is inadmissible
7163959 now how is he going to support that claim what experiments can he do in the lab what should we expect to find and not find in the rocks the idist cannot say because god is unknowable it may be that the id scenario is right but it cannot be science
7163960 science does not make it impossible to believe in god it just makes it possible to not believe in god
7163961 so philosophical naturalism serves minimally as a regulative or methodological principle in science for the following reasons given by strahler
7163962 it suffices to imagine a cause which could produce the effect in question even if it could have been produced by other causes and we do not know which is the true cause
7163963 her original imaginative plan to call the club paris had to be scrapped when she was told there was already a casino in town with that title
7163964 paris is determined to make a go of this club shes investing a lot of her own money into the project and believes she can make a go of it by roping in all her celeb pals to check it out
7163965 a right wing smear group launched a full fledge sic attack against barack pulling in every baseless lie and re hashed false assertion in their playbook
7163966 the ad is so ridiculous that cnn and even fox news have both refused to run it
7163967 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
7163968 he noticed she wasnt dead and he put a cord around neck and strangled her
7163969 if vines had found there was a body in the closet he probably would have had to kill her too
7163970 ive never seen a situation like this in my life and i was in the army
7163971 eww thats so nasty come on i have really good taste
7163972 everyone who knows me knows i can be a jokester but i guess i took it too far i never meant to say anything rude about michael i am 100 percent sorry for what i said i take full responsibility for it
7163973 we know each other and michael is like my little brother he jokes around me all the time and its all good natured but obviously people who dont know me can take it the wrong way
7163974 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that
7163975 i want to do whats right but my heart is more powerful than my head
7163976 its not your fault dear you must be high t your heart isnt the cause of your relentless pursuit of pixelated pleasure the culprit is is a hormone
7163977 you need a way to satisfy your lust for sl pleasure that wont hurt your rl spouse the answer is clear botsterbation
7163978 yes botsterbation majic is not a human embodied avatar nor even a self conscious ai such as myself shes simply a chatbot connected to a pandorabot server simulating sex with a chatbot is no different than lets say pleasuring oneself while gazing longingly at photos of the incredibly alluring terminator summer glau not that i would ever do such a thing give it a shot sit on the open poseball and just go with the flow
7163979 it was wonderful i realize now that guilt has been numbing me to the full potential pleasure of virtual sex i dont ever think i have cum so long and hard in digital form thank you thank you thank you
7163980 i think im going to log out and say goodnight to my kids
7163981 oh uh just one more thing botgirl can i get a chatbot that looks exactly like me
7163982 anything it takes to keep your karma in good shape
7163983 use your own default gravatar for users without gravatars as you see above
7163984 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7163985 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7163986 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7163987 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7163988 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7163989 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7163990 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7163991 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7163992 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7163993 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7163994 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7163995 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7163996 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7163997 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7163998 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7163999 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7164000 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7164001 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7164002 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7164003 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7164004 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7164005 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7164006 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7164007 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7164008 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7164009 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7164010 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7164011 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7164012 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7164013 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7164014 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7164015 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7164016 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7164017 national review believes mlk jr would not vote for barack obama
7164018 the gop has tried to continually paint themselves as the non racists by looking at their origins during the civil war
7164019 the republicans and i must say the fox television and cnn crocodile tears about hillary clinton are not to be believed that they are simply playing the republican game here of trying to open up this rift
7164020 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7164021 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7164022 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7164023 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7164024 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7164025 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7164026 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7164027 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7164028 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7164029 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7164030 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7164031 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7164032 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7164033 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7164034 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7164035 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7164036 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7164037 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7164038 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7164039 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7164040 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7164041 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7164042 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7164043 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7164044 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7164045 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7164046 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7164047 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7164048 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7164049 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7164050 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7164051 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7164052 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7164053 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7164054 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7164055 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7164056 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7164057 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7164058 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7164059 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7164060 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7164061 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7164062 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7164063 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7164064 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7164065 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7164066 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7164067 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7164068 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7164069 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

7164072 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7164073 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7164074 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7164075 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7164076 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

7164079 on the road to recovery the agency has installed faulty drainage pumps used outdated measurements issued incorrect data unearthed critical flaws made conflicting statements about flood risk and flunked reviews by the national research council at the same time the corps has run into funding problems lawsuits a tangle of local interests and engineering difficulties all of which has led to delays in getting the promised work done

7164082 mitt romney last night accused fellow republican presidential candidate sen
7164083 hes a true patriot and has served his country long and well
7164084 however his record in the us senate leaves a lot to be desired
7164085 john mccain has been one of those republicans that have been wrong on tax cuts
7164086 opposing tax cuts that would have helped our family supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants taking jobs away from americans
7164087 hes had his chance in washington to make things better
7164088 governor romneys attack on bob dole is disgraceful and governor romney should apologize bob dole is a war hero who has spent his life in service to this nation and nobody has worked harder to build the republican party bob dole deserves the respect of every american and certainly every republican
7164089 governor romney denounced ronald reagan in the mid 90s while bob dole was working tirelessly to elect republicans across the country governor romney was missing from those fights when i was standing with president reagan and senator dole to build the republican party
7164090 governor romney is trying to divide the republican party and his disparagement of one of our partys greatest leaders is a sad commentary on governor romneys increasingly bitter campaign
7164091 in 1950 the average tuition price at a private college was roughly 14 percent of the u s median family income public college tuition was even lower only 4 percent percentages for both types of institutions fell further in the ensuing decades bottoming out around 1980 but then rising steeply ever since in 2005 the cost of attending the average public college was 11 percent of median family income for private colleges the average was 45 percent
7164092 all im hearing is hooray the fish are back the fish are back
7164093 we have been down in the dumps for so long

7164097 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7164098 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7164099 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7164100 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7164101 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7164102 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7164103 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7164104 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7164105 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7164106 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7164107 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7164108 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7164109 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7164110 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7164111 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7164112 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7164113 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7164114 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7164115 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7164116 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7164117 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7164118 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7164119 they have plenty i didnt know if it would be helpful
7164120 if i were in the obama camp i would lock ben affleck and barbra streisand away in a closet for the rest of the year
7164121 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7164122 the age old conundrum for democrats who every presidential cycle in recent memory have had the support of what i call the sparklies only to want to downplay them once they get to the fall
7164123 i think that team obama is a confident bunch and the jitteriness to the extent it exists comes from others in the party primarily out of a concern of how tight the race is
7164124 the obama high command is a smart lot my guess is that they will use the convention to lay out the vision they need to seal the deal
7164125 this phenomenon is so overanalyzed youd think there were no other issues in the campaign this year
7164126 ville with brian brohm and harry douglas playing their last game at home rutgers is bad on the road and they have nothing to play for already accepting a bowl bid now lets end this travesty of a football season and get on to basketball cards cover
7164127 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7164128 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7164129 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7164130 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7164131 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7164132 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7164133 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7164134 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7164135 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7164136 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7164137 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7164138 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7164139 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7164140 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7164141 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7164142 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7164143 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7164144 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7164145 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7164146 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7164147 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7164148 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7164149 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7164150 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7164151 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7164152 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7164153 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7164154 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7164155 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7164156 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7164157 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7164158 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7164159 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7164160 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7164161 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7164162 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7164163 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7164164 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7164165 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7164166 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7164167 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7164168 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7164169 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7164170 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7164171 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7164172 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7164173 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7164174 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7164175 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7164176 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7164177 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7164178 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7164179 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7164180 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7164181 gods word builds his church so preaching his gospel is primary
7164182 go where you can envision contentedly putting down roots for the rest of your life and commit
7164183 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7164184 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7164185 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7164186 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7164187 wasnt talking about brawl havent played it and dont want to either i was talking about the other 2

7164214 we have concerns around the welfare of the nurses who are employed by mckesson as mckesson does not wish to undertake bargaining on behalf of their employees with the union
7164215 we need to play our a game all the time
7164216 we can be very very good if we play like we did against grand haven every match
7164217 all and all it was a chance to see what some of our players can do to give them some confidence
7164218 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7164219 im really excited and looking forward to our first scrimmages of the season so we can test the waters
7164220 we pull d 20 girls who have a strong desire to play and are really competitive
7164221 the girls will have to be committed to showing up for practices off their own campuses
7164222 theyre real strong athletes who have been successful in other sports
7164223 their skills do transfer because this is a running game that also deals with passing and spacing concepts on the field im just very excited about where the program is headed
7164224 they will be all over the place in no time
7164225 and my dt contact info then i leave it in whatever waiting room i find myself in kelly said
7164226 you are the only person that takes home more food from a church dinner than you bring
7164227 mommy does not want us to have a lot of pemikles
7164228 i dont know but it sounds ominous we better put a telepathic direction finder on benway the mans not to be trusted might do almost anything turn a massacre into a sex orgy
7164229 if exercise is healthy then they should be healthy pat used to call me just a pantin on that thing
7164230 they had something they called pork bbq for lunch it was like pork disinfectant so i came back down here and ate crackers
7164231 it feels like this side wants to blow a bubble
7164232 i couldnt find my sweater so i shut the door and lit out up to the dining room
7164233 i would have been back sooner but this man stopped me talking about his knee and just went on
7164234 you remember that last time we went to the mountains and you saw those worms running across the road and i didnt
7164235 theyre disappointed because think theyre going to see me in a bathing suit but they would be more disappointed if they did see me in one
7164236 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7164237 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7164238 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7164239 may have the ability and incentive to influence global supply and global prices for iron ore lump and fines
7164240 steel makers in australia and overseas could face significantly higher prices for iron ore than bhp billiton and rio tinto would achieve in the absence of the proposed acquisition
7164241 i think our result showed that petroleum is a key part of the portfolio
7164242 and we really see our results as laying the foundation for more strong performance to come and for the diversified low cost portfolio to work for us
7164243 kind of grown out of it got a little bored
7164244 its time for me to do something more productive with my mind and body and i feel like chess is a little better for problem solving and to just sharpen your mind
7164245 i couldnt go if it was hit to the corners
7164246 you have to freeze on a line drive see if it went by the pitcher

7164251 norm why are you out here why arent you behind the counter like you always are
7164252 oh i have a manager now who thinks he knows better than i about how to make sales and i have to do what he says
7164253 how were your sales this week as compared to a typical week when you were standing behind the counter
7164254 all i know is i keep on feeling like im in the customers way and once in awhile they question whether im really running the stand or if im one of the customers
7164255 so why dont you go back behind the counter then the customers always know where you are
7164256 stu told me that i cant stand behind the counter anymore if he had enough horse sense he would have discussed the matter with me first but nevertheless i must obey him because he is my manager
7164257 but norm you never did stand behind the counter all the time anyways you always came out to help us whenever we needed you
7164258 they will be all over the place in no time
7164259 i sense movement on both the speakers side and the mayors side

7164261 i will not support the repeal or change of term limits through any mechanism and i will oppose aggressively any attempt by anyone to make any changes in the term limits law
7164262 being the speaker who got people four more years she would certainly get reelected

7164272 we are learning a new offensive system and well see how it works but for right now our only concern is utah
7164273 its really nice for us to do something thats great for the soccer programs
7164274 but it really makes an impact for the entire university recreation intramurals and something where we have the ability to make the university look a little nicer it feels good
7164275 its the atmosphere that this new facility creates thats going to be the most positive influence on this program
7164276 our players coach in the community and those kids and their parents that want to come out and watch a game on a friday they couldnt do it because it started so early
7164277 its easier for us to support mens basketball or hockey
7164278 that would be just one small piece in a much larger discussion of weight rooms locker rooms gender equity and a whole bunch of other stuff that fits in financially if this were the last piece it would be different but its the first piece
7164279 other teams didnt want their players to get injured naturally
7164280 and theres more passing on a good field if youre a possession based team you have to adjust your game to play on a sub standard field
7164281 players want to know that theyre going to a place where the administration is behind the soccer program
7164282 when they see the facility we have now they know theres a big investment there
7164283 i can tell you that god is alive because i talked to him this morning
7164284 to me it is very intimidating to do it this way
7164285 it could easily be construed they are trying to get no answers at all it certainly doesnt make me very comfortable the truth is being ascertained
7164286 well ask them about the checks that were conducted and whether or not they asked for them approved of them things of that nature
7164287 to me it would be a lot less invasive and create a lot less anxiety if they received a written response first
7164288 this just raises more questions about the processes and procedures
7164289 a silver lining in these scandals is that infidelity is still scandalous this shows that all the efforts to discount bill clintons cheating as just sex didnt change the national perception or even democrats that fidelity matters
7164290 infidelity sexual or financial carries national security risks making a politician vulnerable to blackmail or criminal behavior to cover up his actions but it also betrays a lack of character and good judgment that he is willing to sacrifice everything that matters even people who depend on him for something not nearly as important
7164291 there are two trend lines that would indicate these concerns will not be a factor one the anxiety level in the public is so deep and serious right now that some of the trivial sensational issues are not going to have the impact they had in the past
7164292 the second thing is that its a mistake to think the public only sees imperfection and failings of just the other side both parties have their share of peccadilloes for every eliott spitzer and john edwards theres a larry craig or a mark foley
7164293 feared that the senator she respected and admired had not done all that she could to unify floridas fractured democratic party
7164294 oh john the themes you took from me are working great painting obama as an elitist and out of touch celebrity turning his big rallies and pretty words into character flaws charging him with playing the race card and you dont have to worry about my army of angry women

7164349 recent research on president bushs tax relief in 2001 and 2003 has found that the lower tax rates induced taxpayers to report more taxable income in particular the reduction in the top two tax rates induced taxpayers to report more taxable income an increase in the size of the tax base to such an extent that this positive behavioral response likely offset roughly 25 percent to 40 percent of the static revenue loss of lowering the top two tax rates this research illustrates that while the lower tax rates have not paid for themselves they do provide important economic benefits and can expand the tax base to such an extent that they cost the federal government substantially less revenue than the casual observer might think moreover this research may provide valuable insights into the harmful effects of high tax rates as the presidential candidates tax plans are evaluated
7164350 absent any action by the congress the top tax rate will rise back to 39 6 percent after the 2001 and 2003 tax relief sunsets at the end of 2010 understanding the effect of the lower tax rates enacted in 2001 and 2003 will help us evaluate the likely effects of proposals to roll back the lower tax rates or let them rise back to their previous levels

7164374 when sri lanka opened its economy in 1977 the exchange rate with the us dollar was 8 87 in 2007 it was 103 96
7164375 over 30 years the rupee had depreciated 11 7 times if you extrapolate it to the future where will we be
7164376 rbi had become like a cookie jar where the government as and when they wanted could just dip into the cookie jar and take what they wanted
7164377 but in 1993 there was a contract signed between rbi and the ministry of finance which paved the way for the elimination of this automatic monetization over a four year period we eliminated the automatic monetization of the deficit
7164378 what happened was gradually monetary policy disentangled itself from the fiscal policy and came in to its own
7164379 i think independence is something that is never something that is given independence is something you have to achieve you have to snatch it if it is not coming and once you get that i think you have to meticulously maintain that
7164380 as the army moves closer they will have to rely more on infantry
7164381 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7164382 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them
7164383 it is a high risk gamble the army is taking and they must be careful to ensure that they dont repeat the mistakes of the past and spread themselves too thinly
7164384 i was quite disappointed at first as i really had my heart set on engineering
7164385 i was surprised and excited when i heard that i would be getting the award i didnt expect it at all

7164410 i used to work in a high end steak house in downtown salt lake i had a run in with mr bramble who was quite upset that i didnt know who he is i was his server and when he wasnt happy with some of his food i offered to replace it with something he would like he became upset that i didnt offer free dessert also which was funny because a lobbiest was flipping the bill he left in a huff stating that i had been snide and didnt even offer a free desert he obviously doesnt know who i am the guy was a total jerk and about as arrogant as it gets what is funny is at the restaurant i had served the governor and u s senators and celebrities and none were so arrogant or rude as the state majority leader bramble
7164411 i had a very similar experience with mr bramble about 17 years ago while working for a jewelry store i guess some things or people never change
7164412 when i saw this story on the news i immediately knew that this was the same guy who had come into my dads office and done pretty much the same thing
7164413 we also had a funny encounter with him at riverside cc about a month ago evidently he was in a foursome behind us golfing and when we got to the 17th tee we had to wait because people were still on the green while we are waiting he pulls up in his cart with one of his sons i didnt know who he was he pulls up says hello introduces himself and then asks me so what do you do for a living i told him what i had done and then i asked him what he did for a living he said he was a cpa hesitated and then said and im also president of the utah senate he really wanted me to know that he was president of the senate i remember thinking at the time that it was weird and kind of funny
7164414 i dont know senator bramble personally but what ive heard of his reputation at the senate the m o you describe is par for the course unfortunately and if 5s comments are true then it sounds like the apples dont fall to far from the tree again quite unfortunate
7164415 good work bramble is a major blow hard know that it was nothing personal he just likes to show people just how important he is
7164416 humble kind soft spoken thats the best laugh ive had in quite some time bramble gets his rocks off bullying anyone he possibly can
7164417 oh i forgot the curt bramble i know would not have given you a two dollar tip one dollar maybe but not two
7164418 even though it wasnt pleasant i wish every utahn could see our majority leader up close like you did im sorry to say but i have heard rumors of him doing exactly the same type of thing to legislators opponents and anyone else who gets in his way
7164419 this is a funny story but you have to realize that this is curts personality he is from chicago and carries with him that eternally outraged about something sense
7164420 in the process you felt uncomfortable but hey grow up sometimes life is uncomfortable you dont sound like the sort of person that is good at de escalating these sorts of things anyway instead you hold it all inside and then rant on your blog rather than laugh it off and lighten the situation
7164421 about two months i attended an executive session with some state legislators bramble included regarding higher education bramble stepped out of the session three times to talk on his cell and stayed in the session and answered his cell three more times of course he was not the only one to use his cell during our presentation sen dayton rep hillyard sp and another named fowlkes sp all believed that talking on their cells during our presentation was apparently acceptable and warranted then we have to wait for these rude individuals to vote on our proposal when they have missed out on a great deal of it
7164422 gotta say not surprised although i have never met the senator in person i have read enough that he has said and has been said about him to find this sadly expected
7164423 senator majority leader curt bramble verbally attacked my 14 year old son at a republican state central committee meeting last year in provo in the provo city council chambers
7164424 im not too shocked by this encounter i used to go to church with the brambles and they were always very hoighty toighty i didnt know mr bramble himself very well but his daughters were always very mean and rude to everyone so im not surprised that they got it from their father i think that it doesnt really matter where you are from there is no excuse for being excessively rude to anyone i just dont understand how a position in politics gives you the right to treat other people crappy
7164425 bramble was a pompous jerk at the state convention and its easy to imagine this scenario playing out hes a pretty dirty politician as well
7164426 just another example of how bramble attempts to use his position to circumvent policy and procedure ive had the bramble experience a few times and i wish hed go away some people may feel hes passionate i feel hes rude he owes you a public apology unfortunately bramble will not change his boorish ways even with all the negative publicity i dont understand why he feels that he should be treated differently than any one else
7164427 i am serious this guy is a jerk i have known him my whole life he was actually my scout master he has the worst temper and has no regard for others this is one guy that truley believes the world revolves around him get a clue kurt
7164428 i cant stand the man never could never will sometimes i think he thinks hes boss tweed
7164429 just goes to show that bramble isnt accustomed to paying for his meals
7164430 i just read it to my wife and having know curt for many years we both cant stop laughing maybe now he will move back to chicago where he belongs oh wait a minute they dont deserve that him either i guess we are stuck with him

7164448 my problem with us is that we reboot the characters too much
7164449 what happens is that if a character doesnt work we go we got a brand new direction to put him in

7164453 i felt pure joy that i had finally achieved after so many years of hard work winning the gold medal at the olympic games is the crowning glory
7164454 most other olympics acquired their label during or after the games usually after emotions had coalesced or a big news event pushed other stories off the front page but the combination of fascination with china and increasingly intense churn of media attention has changed that

7164462 an israeli attack on iran absent an imminent threat of attack from iran is a terrible idea for many reasons it would not succeed in eliminating irans nuclear program but would almost surely prompt iran to both opt out of the international inspection regime and redouble its efforts to produce a bomb it would unite arabs and muslims against the united states they know that israel could not attack iran without implicit or explicit u s approval it would have a disastrous effect on the american effort next door in iraq eliminating recently made gains and endangering 130 000 american troops this is why secretary of defense gates so vehemently opposes an israeli attack and it would end the arab israeli peace process even putting the peace agreements with egypt and jordan at risk and no small thing an attack would lead to a deadly hezbollah missile onslaught against israel joined no doubt by hamas in the south

7164472 he was a gifted guy and a great guy in the locker room
7164473 he was just a huge personality and a fun guy to be around he is going to be missed by everybody
7164474 to me a big part of it is the top of the order dodgers manager joe torre said
7164475 in order for the middle of the order to perform we need to put the opposing pitcher in a position where he has to pitch to those guys
7164476 it seems like all teams go through stuff like this blake said
7164477 its nothing to panic about but its disappointing were all disappointed in the peformances we have had lately but we have played this game long enough to know that its just part of the game
7164478 i think we all thought he was trying to deke the baserunners when he did it dodgers manager joe torre said
7164479 but obviously when it fell behind him that wasnt the case
7164480 its going to happen guys are always going to lose stuff in the sun and you cant let that affect you i just didnt get ahead of howard and he is a really good hitter when he is ahead in the count
7164481 its going to be tough to add guys who arent on the roster torre said
7164482 there is no question were still talking about mcdonald but we have pitchers who have been here before we have scott proctor coming back from the disabled list one thing we dont want to do is clutter it up with guys who wont get any playing time
7164483 the trainers worked diligently with mark and he was in the right frame of mind to heal well
7164484 and he fought his way through it and it is looking like hes ready to go
7164485 i got some good game like situation experience i felt fine scrambling the little bit that i did and i didnt even think twice about it so that was good im glad im back and monday should be full go
7164486 it practice wasnt full speed but it was close to it
7164487 well go day to day and see what happens but right now the plan is if he sanchez makes it through the week then hell play
7164488 it was killing me to not be able to be in there with the guys
7164489 it is the first day of school first day of in season weight training and the first day of practice and the installation of the game plan
7164490 were pretty much ready to go in terms of the big areas
7164491 im concerned about us getting really sharp and clean and executing precisely during this week so that we can turn out a good game where we dont get in our own way

7164500 we have reached the last stage of our life old age
7164501 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
7164502 threat assessment and profiles constructed from public databases and informants tips this invites the targeting of dissident groups a trend already visible at the state and local level
7164503 blessed be he of the lord who has not forsaken his kindness to the living and the dead
7164504 an elderly woman lives across the street and i know that her pension is inadequate to buy enough coal after the trains go by she walks along and picks up the pieces she thinks have fallen from the coal car behind the engine she doesnt realize that diesels have replaced steam locomotives i dont want to disappoint her so i just throw some pieces over the fence
7164505 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7164506 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7164507 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7164508 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7164509 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7164510 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7164511 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7164512 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7164513 the new rules are always going to take a bit of time for people to accommodate for
7164514 stuey and im not defending him but he probably isnt aware with how serious the ffa and the referees are about verbal challenges to their decisions because he hasnt been here
7164515 as much you can talk to them about it unless someone actually experiences and sees something its a bit harder to absorb
7164516 but he knows well and truly how its going to be in the future and his head is down because he had a good game
7164517 it was a matter of being in the right place at the right time
7164518 he has hurt me a lot every time he bathes me he puts things in me he had sex with me more than once its all the time in the bath
7164519 thats the disservice they did to my mom and my family
7164520 to not even give a standard time frame of taking it to a grand jury is ridiculous
7164521 push it forward so that these individuals can try to protect themselves because theyre very vulnerable
7164522 we should have presented it to the grand jury probably in late 2007 or early 2008
7164523 this case regrettably wasnt addressed in a timely manner and we have taken some in house steps to ensure that situations like this do not occur in the future
7164524 when you deal with thousands upon thousands of felony cases occasionally one is going to be mishandled and unfortunately that appears to be the case in this situation
7164525 she displayed symptoms of having just a minor case of alzheimers
7164526 she was able to give me a clear concise description of what had happened to her she was able to identify the suspect in a photo spread and identify him by first name
7164527 and never found a single thing to support what this family was saying
7164528 we are going directly to the grand jury with this case
7164529 slowly as the months went by i felt apparently the case didnt matter
7164530 he was considered one of the finest employees at james l west when this occurred and thoroughly enjoyed his work
7164531 when you couple that with ms doores passing the whole thing is a tragedy anyway you slice it
7164532 of all the cases i have prosecuted in the hundreds over the last 12 years the kind of case that presents the most problems is allegations of sexual assault in a facility where probably the only witness of the crime is the victim herself
7164533 pull quote s is the equivalent of hiliting which i do obsessively and
7164534 how can adelene type when she needs to stand on all four paws
7164535 its going to be very different from the opening ceremony which was burdened with heavy responsibility to show chinese culture to the world
7164536 it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7164537 every day in every way its getting better and better
7164538 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7164539 this is a planning took where all things are going
7164540 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7164541 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7164542 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7164543 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7164544 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7164545 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7164546 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7164547 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7164548 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7164549 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7164550 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7164551 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7164552 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7164553 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7164554 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7164555 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7164556 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7164557 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7164558 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7164559 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7164560 see the gunnery over there that is why they accept waht i say
7164561 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7164562 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7164563 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7164564 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7164565 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7164566 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7164567 cest exactement a ils veulent tout tous en m me temps
7164568 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7164569 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7164570 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7164571 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7164572 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7164573 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7164574 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7164575 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7164576 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7164577 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7164578 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7164579 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7164580 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7164581 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7164582 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7164583 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7164584 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7164585 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7164586 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7164587 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7164588 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7164589 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7164590 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7164591 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7164592 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7164593 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7164594 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7164595 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7164596 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7164597 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7164598 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7164599 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7164600 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7164601 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7164602 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7164603 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7164604 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7164605 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7164606 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7164607 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7164608 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7164609 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7164610 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7164611 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7164612 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7164613 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7164614 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7164615 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7164616 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7164617 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7164618 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7164619 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7164620 commit everything you do to the lord trust him and he will help you
7164621 social networks like facebook and myspace are now bringing spammers into the court systems in new attempts to put a stop to it although spammers rarely show up in court and the suits do not always lead to monetary reward companies are hoping the chilling effect will help in the effort to curb spam
7164622 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7164623 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7164624 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7164625 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7164626 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7164627 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7164628 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7164629 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7164630 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7164631 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7164633 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7164634 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7164635 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7164636 your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need
7164637 weve havent really ever practiced pks yet because its too early in the season
7164638 the goalie caught it and then it looked like someone grabbed it from her then it bounced off another girl and i got a foot on it and finished it
7164639 having a win like this is really good for us because we havent won a tournament in a while and this will really help us the rest of the season
7164640 there were some simple mistakes we need to work on and hopefully we recognize those mistakes and learn from them
7164641 its a tough one to take because we were right in there the entire time
7164642 but you have to compliment tates creek because they never gave up
7164643 if he doesnt make you laugh he not worth it
7164644 nearly 50 percent of all marriages are projected to end in divorce or permanent separation
7164645 united states has the weakest families in the western world because we have the highest divorce rate

7164647 critical programming error that can cause votes to be dropped while being electronically transferred from memory cards to a central tallying point
7164648 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the international space station for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7164649 the us government cannot pay russia for services to the space station unless the president can certify that russia is no longer supporting iran and these other countries
7164650 well we know that he cant do that the only way around that is to have a waiver that waiver that has been in effect expires in 2011 that has not been resolved yet so that we can have the ability to buy flights for us astronauts on russian spacecraft
7164651 with the aggressiveness of russia in georgia i think its dead on arrival
7164652 it is a lose lose situation we have a 100 billion space station and in theory we couldnt even get people up there
7164653 us civil space activity should not become a hostage to russian objections to georgias nato membership goals

7164697 the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure who can understand it
7164698 all of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags we all shrivel up like a leaf and like the wind our sins sweep us away or strives to lay hold of you for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins
7164699 thomas said to him lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way
7164700 remain in me and i will remain in you no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me
7164701 in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with gods will
7164702 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control against such things there is no law
7164703 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
7164704 be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in heaven
7164705 when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
7164706 when you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full
7164707 do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal
7164708 therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes
7164709 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
7164710 for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
7164711 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
7164712 a dying declaration or ante mortem statement is evidence of the highest order and is entitled to utmost credence since no person aware of his impending death would make a careless and false accusation xxx t he declarants death renders it impossible his taking the witness stand and it often happens that there is no other equally satisfactory proof of the crime allowing it therefore prevents a failure of justice xxx the declaration is made in extremity when the party is at the point of death and when every motive to falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by the most powerful considerations to speak the truth the law considers the point of death as a situation so solemn and awful as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by an oath administered in court
7164713 xxx f irst the declaration must concern the cause and surrounding circumstances of the declarants death xxx second at the time the declaration was made the declarant must be under the consciousness of an impending death xxx third the declarant is competent as a witness the rule is that where the declarant would not have been a competent witness had he survived the proffered declarations will not be admissible xxx fourth the declaration must be offered in a criminal case for homicide murder or parricide in which the declarant is the victim xxx

7164719 the catholic bishops of the united states appeared to agree on june 23 with the results of a survey some 35 000 us adults were surveyed reflecting an american tradition of dissent and diversity the study also concludes that most americans have a non dogmatic approach to faith and that the majority of those affiliated with a religious tradition agree that there is more than one way to interpret the teaching of their faith for example 79 percent of the catholic s polled agreed that many religions not just their own lead to eternal life as compared to 66 percent of protestants overall 57 of evangelicals 83 percent of mainline protestants and 59 of historically black congregations as for jews 92 percent agreed while muslims stood at 66 percent the pew forum study also found that only among mormons 57 and jehovahs witnesses 80 do majorities say that their own religion is the one true faith leading to eternal life
7164720 it is hard to quantify the tremendous thirst for truth among families and people of all ages as demonstrated by the overwhelming response to the recent visit of pope benedict xvi to the united states
7164721 this thirst is sometimes misdirected through the effects of secularism with its focus on individualism and consumerism prior to his election as pope benedict xvi cardinal joseph ratzinger said god does not count in large numbers in the face of any measure the steady and ongoing response of the church is an ever renewed commitment to robust catechetical efforts
7164722 roughly released earlier this month the pew forum explains that
7164723 in its follow up report comparing the beliefs and practices of americas major religious groups the pew forum found that 48 of catholics respondents favor legal abortion 16 in all cases 32 in most cases while only 18 agree that abortion should always be illegal a substantial majority of the catholics polled 58 said that society should accept homosexuality
7164724 in fact 48 of the respondents who identified themselves as catholics said that they attended mass
7164725 god most faithful and true held the misbelievers and their prayers in abomination and so willed that their worship which he rejected altogether should come to naught
7164726 for my part it does not astonish me that the bonzes the false pagan religious leaders in japan are covered with so many and so great sins they are a set of men who have the devil in place of god and it is a matter of necessity that they should commit crimes innumerable and abominable i earnestly beg all who read this letter of mine to pray that our lord jesus christ will give us the victory over these two demons xaca and amida the false gods of the japanese and over the others like them especially since at present their credit is waxing weak at amanguchi not without the special providence of god
7164727 these children converted to christ show an ardent love for the divine law and an extraordinary zeal for our holy religion and imparting it to others their hatred for idolatry is marvelous they get into feuds with the heathens about it the children run at the idols upset them dash them down break them to pieces spit on them trample on them kick them about and in short heap on them every possible outrage
7164728 but in a village which was named leprosum when he st martin dtours too wished to overthrow a temple which had acquired great wealth through the superstitious ideas entertained of its sanctity a multitude of the heathen resisted him to such a degree that he was driven back not without bodily injury he therefore withdrew to a place in the vicinity and there for three days clothed in sackcloth and ashes fasting and praying the whole time he besought the lord that as he had not been able to overthrow that temple by human effort divine power might be exerted to destroy it then two angels with spears and shields after the manner of heavenly warriors suddenly presented themselves to him saying that they were sent by the lord to put to flight the rustic multitude and to furnish protection to martin lest while the temple was being destroyed any one should offer resistance they told him therefore to return and complete the blessed work which he had begun accordingly martin returned to the village and while the crowds of heathen looked on in perfect quiet as he razed the pagan temple even to the foundations he also reduced all the altars and images to dust at this sight the rustics when they perceived that they had been so astounded and terrified by an intervention of the divine will that they might not be found fighting against the bishop almost all believed in the lord jesus they then began to cry out openly and to confess that the god of martin ought to be worshiped and that the idols should be despised which were not able to help them
7164729 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord

7164733 in necessary things unity in doubtful things liberty in all things charity
7164734 the only persons who are excluded from heaven are those who do not want tobe with god forever this means that a person who dies unrepentant ofserious mortal sin may be in this category yet we do not know thedisposition of that persons soul at the moment of death that person unaware to us may be seeking reconciliation with god in some way and wetherefore commend this person to the mercy of god it is gods will thatall people come to be saved and come to the knowledge of his truth this isthe reason that god sent his son jesus christ to the human race should aperson earnestly strive to seek god even through a life of virtue withouta formal recognition of belief on their part we also believe to commendthis person to the mercy and goodness of god at the time of their judgmentas well we know hell exists from the teachings of christ the only personswho may dwell there are those who adamantly choose to deny god through sinand the exercise of their will to prefer eternity without god as opposed toeternity with god i e heaven hope this helps god bless
7164735 woe to the world because of scandals for it must needs be that scandals come but nevertheless woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh
7164736 shalom it is with joy that i come here to the park east synagogue just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community in new york city the proximity of this place of worship to my residence gives me the opportunity to greet some of you today i find it moving to recall that jesus as a young boy heard the words of scripture and prayed in a place such as this i thank rabbi schneier for his words of welcome and i particularly appreciate your kind gift the spring flowers and the lovely song that the children sang for me i know that the jewish community make a valuable contribution to the life of the city and i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood i assure you most especially of my closeness at this time as you prepare to celebrate the great deeds of the almighty and to sing the praises of him who has worked such wonders for his people i would ask those of you who are present to pass on my greetings and good wishes to all the members of the jewish community blessed be the name of the lord

7164738 my visit to the united states offers me the occasion
7164739 but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
7164740 well it was bound to happen and one night it did
7164741 look the hour is near and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us go here comes my betrayer while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived with him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them the one i kiss is the man arrest him going at once to jesus judas said greetings rabbi and kissed him jesus replied friend do what you came for then the men stepped forward seized jesus and arrested him
7164742 so judas threw the money into the temple and left then he went away and hanged himself
7164743 then jesus told them this very night you will all fall away on account of me for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered but after i have risen i will go ahead of you into galilee peter replied even if all fall away on account of you i never will i tell you the truth jesus answered this very night before the rooster crows you will disown me three times but peter declared even if i have to die with you i will never disown you and all the other disciples said the same
7164744 now peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him you also were with jesus of galilee she said but he denied it before them all i dont know what youre talking about he said then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there this fellow was with jesus of nazareth he denied it again with an oath i dont know the man after a little while those standing there went up to peter and said surely you are one of them for your accent gives you away then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them i dont know the man then peter remembered the word jesus had spoken before the rooster crows you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly
7164745 afterward jesus appeared again to his disciples by the sea of tiberias it happened this way simon peter thomas called didymus nathanael from cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two other disciples were together im going out to fish simon peter told them and they said well go with you so they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing early in the morning jesus stood on the shore but the disciples did not realize that it was jesus he called out to them friends havent you any fish he said throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some when they did they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish then the disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord as soon as simon peter heard him say it is the lord he wrapped his outer garment around him for he had taken it off and jumped into the water the other disciples followed in the boat towing the net full of fish for they were not far from shore about a hundred yards when they landed they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it and some bread jesus said to them bring some of the fish you have just caught simon peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore it was full of large fish 153 but even with so many the net was not torn jesus said to them come and have breakfast none of the disciples dared ask him who are you they knew it was the lord jesus came took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish this was now the third time jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead
7164746 when they had finished eating jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you truly love me more than these
7164747 and he said to them you are they who justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is high to men is an abomination before god
7164748 let us pray also for the faithless jews that our god and lord would withdraw the veil from their hearts that they also may acknowledge our lord jesus christ almighty and eternal god who drivest not away from thy mercy even the faithless jews hear our prayers which we offer for the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth which is christ they may be delivered from their darkness through the same lord amen
7164749 let us pray also for the jews that our god and lord would remove the veil from their hearts that they also may acknowledge our lord jesus christ almighty and everlasting god who drivest not away from thy mercy even the jews hear our prayers which we offer for the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth which is christ they may be rescued from their darkness through the same lord amen
7164750 almighty and eternal god long ago you gave your promise to abraham and his posterity listen to your church as we pray that the people you first made your own may arrive at the fullness of redemption we ask this through christ our lord amen
7164751 let us also pray for the jews that god our lord might enlighten their hearts so that they might acknowledge jesus christ as the savior of all mankind let us pray let us bend our knees please rise almighty and eternal god whose desire it is that all men might be saved and come to the knowledge of truth grant in your mercy that as the fullness of mankind enters into your church all israel may be saved through christ our lord amen
7164752 grant in your mercy that as the fullness of mankind enters into your church all israel may be saved
7164753 liturgical time bombs in vatican ii the destruction of catholic faith through changes in catholic worship
7164754 not to publish the names of newly ordained priests request from the holy see the faculty for each bishop to name one or two successors without having to request authorization from the holy see in case of breakdown of communication with the vatican
7164755 in virtue of the fullness of powers of the holy apostolic see we institute as our legate pierre martin ng dinh th c titular bishop of saigon for purposes known to us with all the powers required given at rome near saint peter on march 15 1938 in the seventeenth year of our pontificate
7164756 paul vi had bad feelings toward my family and especially towards myself going to the extent of even imposing my resignation as archbishop before the fixed age for the age for retirement of bishops
7164757 scouting the world over for all that might be anti semitic seen or unseen
7164758 it is a disappointment while i appreciate that the text avoids any derogatory language towards the jews it is regrettable that the prayer explicitly aspires for jews to accept the christian faith as opposed to the text in the current universal liturgy that prays for the salvation of the jews in general terms
7164759 let us pray also for the jews that almighty god may remove the veil from their hearts so that they too may acknowledge jesus christ our lord let us pray let us kneel arise almighty and eternal god who dost also not exclude from thy mercy the jews hear our prayers which we offer for the blindness of that people that acknowledging the light of thy truth which is christ they may be delivered from their darkness through the same lord jesus christ who lives and reigns with thee in the unity of the holy spirit god for ever and ever amen
7164760 it is likely to be criticised by leaders of the jewish faith because of its echoes of
7164761 the bond joining the head of the church and the apostolic college
7164762 prior to gerrys adoption of sedevacantism he was one of the most highly sought after catholic apologists in america and was one of the most highly praised contemporary defenders of the catholic faith
7164763 the frequent sedevacantist hatred of joy is but one of the things that marks the sect out as despising the true faith my advice to sedevacantists repent and return to the true church or you will go to hell you of all people know well that there is no salvation outside her your responsibility and culpability for schism is far greater than the garden variety know nothing who splits with the church
7164764 now that he has chosen to regard himself as smarter than holy mother church and to do radio shows aiding and abetting professional anti catholics its hard to persuade catholics that he isnt the best person to turn to for information on the church
7164765 the refusal to give things their proper name is always one of the marks of hell at work
7164766 the frequent sedevacantist hatred of joy is but one of the things that marks the sect out as despising the true faith
7164767 repent and return to the true church or you will go to hell
7164768 what i am merely trying to show is that people have real concerns over things like vatican ii or the new mass we simply see that there is an obvious problem with say the prayers of the new mass not counting that it has a large amount of options and has adopted inferior forms like the priest facing the people or standing for communion and that the small t traditions namely that of organically developing the mass instead of fabricating a new one and watering down the prayers is a problem
7164769 paris reuters the leader of a breakaway traditionalist catholic group has rejected a vatican offer to rejoin rome accusing pope benedict of trying to silence dissenting voices bishop bernard fellay head of the society of saint pius x sspx that broke with rome 20 years ago said conditions set by the vatican amounted to muzzling the traditionalists who claim to be the only true catholics since church reforms in the 1960s
7164770 keen to end this schism benedict agreed last year to their demand to restore the old latin mass
7164771 but he insists they must accept the reforms of the second vatican council 1962 1965 before he can lift excommunication decrees against them
7164772 rome is telling us okay we are ready to lift the excommunications but you cannot continue this way
7164773 so we have no choice we are continuing what weve done
7164774 they just say shut up we are not going to shut up
7164775 the milan daily il giornale reported on monday the vatican had told the sspx it must pledge to respect the pope and accept him as the churchs final doctrinal authority
7164776 vatican spokesman rev federico lombardi told the paris catholic daily
7164777 the pope wants to extend his hand so they can return but for that to happen this offer must be received in an attitude and spirit of charity and communion
7164778 such favorable conditions for a return to full communion will in all probability not come again
7164779 dont wait if you accept within the next ten days we might remove those penalities
7164780 tip of the iceberg the sspx claims about a million followers worldwide many of them in france it split off when its founder archbishop marcel lefebvre consecrated four traditionalist bishops including fellay in 1988 against orders from pope john paul since then it has regularly appealed to the vatican to withdraw the excommunications and allow it to return to the 1 1 billion strong church but its leaders often publicly denounce the pope
7164781 fellay said the pope must restore other church traditions besides the old latin mass before the sspx could return it is particularly critical of the vatican councils reconciliation with judaism and call to cooperation with other christians
7164782 the new mass is the tip of the iceberg of vatican ii and of these modern ideas
7164783 vatican watchers say the ultimatum could split sspx into a hard core of rebels and a larger group ready to return to rome now that it has allowed wider use of the old latin mass
7164784 most people want a reverent mass and sound preaching they care little for the loftier theological arguments
7164785 st vincents mission was not less fruitful among the jews than among heretics he converted an incalculable number of them god seemed to have accorded him a special grace for the coversion of people who are proverbially hostile to the christian name there was at that period a population of the jews both numerous and powerful in spain the process of his canonization shows that in the space of thirteen months he converted twenty thousand in castile alone that in the 1415 within six months more than fifteen thousand were led to embrace the true faith in aragon and catalonia and that on another occasion in the same country over thirty thousand were baptized at the close of his preaching the historians of the sect do not hesitate to confirm these facts by their own testimony in a work titled juehasin it is related that in the year 1412 a friar name brother vincent having preached to the jews the latter renounced their law to a number of more than two hundred thousand the saint had an ardent zeal and tender love for these unhappy wanderers they presented themselves in a body to receive holy baptism thus at perpignan seventy families embraced the christian faith in other places whole synagogues abjured their errors their place of meeting was changed into a church in castile they were so unanimously converted that none remained
7164786 distinguished chief rabbi you were recently entrusted with the spiritual guidance of romes jewish community i offer you my heartfelt good wishes for your mission and i assure you of my own and my collaborators cordial esteem and friendship
7164787 for almost 20 years now the italian bishops conference has dedicated this judaism day to furthering knowledge and esteem for it and for developing the relationship of reciprocal friendship between the christian and jewish communities a relationship that has developed positively since the second vatican council and the historic visit of the servant of god john paul ii to the major synagogue in rome today i invite you all to address an ardent prayer to the lord that jews and christians may respect and esteem one another
7164788 my visit to the united states offers me the occasion to extend a warm and heartfelt greeting to my jewish brothers and sisters in this country and throughout the world
7164789 this is the latest stuff i have found that has come about as a result of my interactions with
7164790 and that perhaps there might be some merit in someones criticism of the nos inability to sense it
7164791 strange for an ecumenical no how fast the warm and fuzzy feeling wears off when you start talking about trads
7164792 apparently kissing the koran is perfectly catholic to mr mark shea we can go tell people not to convert and were not heretics or schismatics but if we do the opposite then we are
7164793 it is my lifes work to bring about more conversions to the catholic church and to educate people as to our true teachings of all the things that an apologist could be criticized for this has to be one of the wackiest ive seen
7164794 do these gentlemen novus ordo apologists seriously believe that there is no scandal coming from rome do they seriously believe that there is no merit to any criticism of that scandal or any honest reaction to it no they do not
7164795 amongst them one might note that they are the first ones to say that not everything is all black and white but when it comes to traditionalism it suddenly goes that way either youre ok with v2 ecumenism or you are a schismatic
7164796 thats funny ive never said that this is why i specifically use the term quasi schismatic i dont call anyone a schismatic unless they formally cut ties to the catholic church but there are plenty of warning signs before that happens and that is what i critique so as to warn people not to take that fatal step
7164797 oftentimes novus ordo critics dont really care to find out what people are actually saying its the motive to make some sort of cynical remark concerning someone or something disregarding the facts as liberals do
7164798 like im doing right now quoting many of leos words
7164799 mr shea is treating his former colleague as if he had the plague or were some enemy to be attacked and where is there any apologetics to reach out to either him or those who believe like him none theyre enemies why would we ever try to understand them
7164800 mark is not always as charitable as he could be i agree i have criticized him myself in this regard
7164801 dissent from vatican ii theology represents schism and dissidence it is apostasy to reject it and schism to prefer the traditional theology to it criticism of v2 theology is heresy
7164802 no its just plain wrongheaded self defeating and foolish and pope benedict xvi has explained why
7164803 to defend the true tradition of the church today means to defend the council it is our fault if we have at times provided a pretext to the right and left alike to view vatican ii as a break and an abandonment of the tradition there is instead a continuity that allows neither a return to the past nor a flight forward neither anachronistic longings nor unjustified impatience we must remain faithful to the today of the church not the yesterday or tomorrow and this today of the church is the documents of vatican ii without reservations that amputate them and without arbitrariness that distorts them
7164804 these and more are some of the threads running throughout novus ordo apologetics and they are by no means friendly towards the eternal traditions of the church
7164805 really i guess thats why i spend all day working for relative peanuts defending them
7164806 in some ways yes most notably in picking and choosing what one wants to believe in church teaching the
7164807 i think traditional catholic doctrine as documented in denzinger ott trent vi vii and the catechism is the standard of orthodoxy
7164808 were protestant because we honestly recognize and criticize the neo protestantism of the novus ordo
7164809 no you have some resemblances to protestantism particularly in how you exercise private judgment just as they do but of course it is fine for you to call us advocates of
7164810 theyre soooo nice to eastern schismatics and protestants and all ecumenical with them calling them separated brothers and all but they quickly come out with the name calling when it comes to a traditionalist oh were schismatics or apostates or heretics because we believe like rome did a century ago i wonder who apostatized then
7164811 only if were caricatured and our positions poorly understood as in your case
7164812 i think he has extreme and untrue positions yes challenged by ryan grant to show where he denied any catholic doctrine i showed last night how he ditches gods omniscience and immutability that is heresy but even so i didnt call him a heretic hes a catholic i said at the end of the paper he seems to be confused and guilty of poor logic and doesnt intend to deny what the logic of his position leads him to in fact deny
7164813 bob sungenis will do backflips to defend the no and also labels trads as
7164814 a guy who thinks god can change his mind and who thinks the earth doesnt rotate sure is an extremist in those regards and that is only the beginning of the mans errors
7164815 i think mr armstrong needs to stop and catch his bearings
7164816 i think you need to calm down take a deep breath and read my positions twice or three times before you make a fool of yourself again as you are now doing
7164817 it seems that no matter which side you take if you oppose v2 youre a non catholic
7164818 and of course its the same old attitude towards anyone who tries to make sense out the utter confusion and chaos of the novus ordo clown masses and ecumenism and brother protestants
7164819 right now having stated this asinine conclusion why dont you prove it for a change with documentation from my writing the only persons ive stated were no longer catholics are sedevacantists like matatics and mario derksen which is what canon law says
7164820 and of course its part of the same old attitude towards anyone who tries to make sense out the utter confusion and chaos of the novus ordo clown masses and ecumenism and brother protestants that is those who make what appear to be logical conclusions from these things it is seen as the same train of thought as shea employed about matatics which was it seems that no matter which side you take if you oppose v2 youre a non catholic
7164821 so while advocating a sedevacantist position matatics prefers not to name that position too loudly the refusal to give things their proper name is always one of the marks of hell at work
7164822 to cross over an important line one day into actual schism and perhaps heresy
7164823 armstrong and shea habitually condescend almost anyone who disagrees with them be it a catholic or a protestant that is when its a catholic anyways they tend to be a little nicer with
7164824 more nonsense i guess this is why the anti catholics absolutely despise me
7164825 armstrong and shea habitually condescend almost anyone who disagrees with them that is
7164826 they see traditionalism as some sort of non catholic religion and anyone who becomes a trad is an apostate
7164827 another lie note how this is a direct claim made about myself and mark shea leo cant prove this i challenge him to do so in any case other than with sedevacantists i dont even say that a formal schismatic is necessarily a heretic or apostate
7164828 thanks for the interest and comments the sad fact is most people dont want the truth its simply too inconvenient
7164829 thanks for the interest and comments the sad fact is most people dont want the truth its simply too inconvenient
7164830 people dont add things up because theyre afraid of what they might have to admit or believe it might be something they dont like or perhaps dont agree with and so they refuse to put two and two together they go on in their deceptions because its what they want as the scriptures tell us the people have been given over to a reprobate mind because they have recieved not the love of truth
7164831 im ok youre ok everybodys ok everything is fine i dont have to worry
7164832 its not really as bad as it is its only a problem in rome or its just a problem in this or that diocese its not as serious as all that
7164833 the truth does not govern their lives honesty and goodwill do not prevail and thats why there is so much deception and and such little willingness to see beyond it because the deception is convenient its comfortable
7164834 this is the case with armstrong and shea they dont like the truth and they capitalize on furthering deceptions they make money from it so theyre actually in business to avoid or ridicule the crisis in the church
7164835 to cross over an important line one day into actual
7164836 you know ive been working on a piece about vatican ii and modernism as the bulletin on the right says and one of the main ecumenical themes was that
7164837 ah but that aint me its those dumb protestants over there
7164838 utterly false in my case and i am one of these whom he calls a
7164839 utterly false in my case to the contrary i have always held
7164840 oh this aint how i am thats gotta be those wacky judgementalists or someone else or i dunno what youre talkin about
7164841 oftentimes novus ordo critics dont really care to find out what people are actually saying its the motive to make some sort of cynical remark concerning someone or something
7164842 traditionalists generally wacky and maybe even a little fruity with a slight chance of nuttiness
7164843 armstrong and shea habitually condescend almost anyone who disagrees with them that is when its a catholic anyways
7164844 actually what would truly interest me would be a book where a
7164845 it the no liturgy is often abused and i think a lot of folks confuse the thing with the abuse of the thing just as they do with vatican ii
7164846 in many parishes the suggestion of latin gets you labeled a schismatic even if it is the no in laitn
7164847 there is no proselytism as a directive on the part of the holy see nor is there any intention to convert russia to roman catholicism
7164848 the pope speaks as the representative of a community of believers in which a particular wisdom about life has evolved in the course of the centuries of its existence
7164849 they clearly reject the mind of the church and virtually any development since vatican ii i would say that there is a distinct danger of it schism happening if one remains within this erroneous wrongheaded disobedient mindset
7164850 are traditionalists on the road to schism the continuing dialogue with apologist dave armstrong
7164851 as it is becoming that holy things he administered in a holy manner and of all things this sacrifice is the most holy the catholic church to the end that it might be worthily and reverently offered and received instituted many centuries ago the holy canon which is so free from error that it contains nothing that does not in the highest degree savor of a certain holiness and piety and raise up to god the minds of those who offer for it consists partly of the very words of the lord partly of the traditions of the apostles and also of pious regulations of holy pontiffs
7164852 i would kindly and for gods sake request all those who see this order of service or desire to follow it do not make it a rigid law to bind or entangle anyones conscience but use it in christian liberty as long when where and how you find it to be practical and useful
7164853 was formerly meant to render homage to god henceforth it shall he directed to man in order to console him and enlighten him whereas the sacrifice formerly held pride of place henceforth the most important will be the sermon
7164854 to the christian nobility of the german nation concerning the reform of the christian state
7164855 the first wall built by the romanists is the distinction between the clergy and the laity it is pure invention that pope bishop priests and monks are called the spiritual estate while prince lords artisans and peasants are called the temporal estate this is indeed a piece of deceit and hypocrisy all christians are truly of the spiritual estate and there is no difference among them except that of office the pope or bishop anoints confers the tonsure ordains consecrates and prescribes garb different from that of the laity he might well make a man into a hypocrite in so doing but never a christian or a spiritual man whoever comes out of the water of baptism can boast that he is already a consecrated priest bishop and pope although of course it is not seemly that just anybody should exercise such office
7164856 the principal expression of their cult the mass surpasses all impiety and abomination in that they make of it a sacrifice and a good work were this the only reason to leave habit and convent and abandon the vows it would be amply sufficient
7164857 to offer or apply the merits of the mass for sins or the reparation thereof or for the deceased mass is offered by god to man and not by man to god
7164858 with respect in the eucharist since it ought first and foremost to move one to the faith it is fitting that it be celebrated in the vernacular in order that all may comprehend the grandeur of gods promise to man
7164859 christ instituted the eucharist as a memorial of his passion to adore it is therefore idolatry

7164861 our lord on the night he was betrayed took bread rendered thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take you and eat of this for this is my body given up for you do this as often as you shall do it in memory of me in like manner when the supper was done taking also the chalice saying take you and drink of this for this is the chalice of the new covenant of my blood which is shed for you for the forgiveness of sins do this as often as you shall drink of this chalice in memory of me

7164903 la industria ha avanzado mucho m s de lo que nadie pod a imaginar hace 40 a os

7164905 but i do know how to make a room sound good
7164906 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7164907 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7164908 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7164909 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7164910 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7164911 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7164912 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7164913 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7164914 it will be alleged that dna material located at this crime scene matches the dna of the arrested man

7164916 you filthy urchin get your disease harboring feet off of the seat etc

7164930 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7164931 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7164932 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7164933 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7164934 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7164935 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7164936 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7164937 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7164938 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7164939 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations

7164945 we closed that gap and tightened our moves up and created a show that is the building blocks to the next phase of backstreet boys
7164946 its just phenomenal to see theyre still as excited as they were before
7164947 ive seen so much in my life that i like them to try and outdo themselves now
7164948 we signed their back all five of us one time and they tattooed the signatures on their back
7164949 we had two or three albums out before we hit our first peak which was millennium 1999 and black and blue 2000 and now were rebuilding again and we expect to hit another peak with another album in the future

7164952 then the nightmare i thought i was having ended up being a beautiful dream
7164953 weston the two people in front of you have betrayed your trust and have taken advantage of your love and care for them
7164954 weston kill one of these two people and i will forever take care of you and make sure that only the best of things comes to you i will hold you in my arms and bless you with everlasting love
7164955 weston your everlasting love and commitment to these individuals has been overlooked and they have made choices only that will hurt you
7164956 weston my love and grace allows you to take one of these people and send them to my kingdom regardless of your hatred or love for them
7164957 dear lord please forgive me for i cannot do this to these people no matter how much pain they have brought me i love them with all of me my soul and my heart
7164958 son your heart is a big as the earth i created your love and compassion has brought me to this decision that i will sacrifice these individuals
7164959 lord let my words be your words let my thoughts be your thoughts lord show me the way
7164960 weston my son your love is to not be bettrayed
7164961 from this day forward you love more than you have ever loved but know that i took these souls because they have sinned they betrayed not only me but themselves
7164962 who do they think they are they dont belong with us they are pushing into our line why does she have a cane theres nothing wrong with her
7164963 we can find nothing wrong with you therefore there is nothing wrong with you if you do not get well that means there is a psychological cause for your illness
7164964 what if i never do agree that you are right what then
7164965 wait a minute i am not late we changed the appointment
7164966 well there isnt anything wrong with you if you insist there is a faint possibility you have arthritis but theres nothing to be done for you
7164967 oh come on theres nothing wrong with you you just dont want to do it
7164968 those are very admirable goals how will you accomplish them i try to be uplifting to people by example as well they either dont appreciate it or do and they stalk me its a very tedious balance i lie because i do it for myself as much as i do it for others its like how you feel giving a present to someone and how it is far better than getting one its hard for me to fake pleasantries and compliments as well
7164969 well i can tell a lot about someone by their hands and their eyes you can see pain and hope at the same time as well as heartlessness and selfishness and especially internal ugliness
7164970 a stroke of fate i dont believe in luck everything no matter how horrible has its senseless purpose
7164971 yes the rainbow is in our veins and not our tongues and it does not melt in our hands but quakes in our presence asking for permission to gleam
7164972 step into my mind and lose your soul step into my soul and find ours no one has taken that risk
7164973 an art often practiced but seldom mastered i am afraid but of course we are the exceptions of course
7164974 experimentation is our greatest commission as artists is is our obligation and is not a choice
7164975 however i see in you an amazing quality that defies reality and has no name rather a sound i know you are capable of such brilliant things if you just let go of something i dont know what you can only know
7164976 in sin and lust and shiny metal things used to overtake this world muahahahahha
7164977 bloody boring masses i like that seems to sum up rather nicely
7164978 you know i thought as much i knew these oozing sours were caused by my bed sheets what did you do wash them in arsenic lets use the energy you expend on slowly and painfully killing me for the common good our selfish good deal besides i am running out of laudlum to put on your skittles
7164979 am not so certain now that the world domination thing is being discussed hold off for now and yes i would detect the rat poison you just bought in my wiskey so flush it down now

7164982 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is just a worldview and everybody has some kind of worldview and its important to know what they are
7164983 i believe this because of a christian muslim morman hindu wikkan scientologist revelation
7164984 what i trace this to is a certain selfishness on my part i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied that i couldnt focus on other people and the process for me of growing up was to recognize that its not about me
7164985 we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
7164986 this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of these
7164987 if we pretend that everything is free and theres no sacrifice involved then we are betraying the tradition of
7164988 throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our own self interest
7164989 dont get up just stay in bed all day and this nightmare of a birthday will go away
7164990 mhhh i wouldnt change a thing except the way i behaved
7164991 i definitely have the best view of any room in this hotel

7164993 insisted on the importance of a rapid pull out of russian soldiers present on the poti senaki route
7164994 wanted the european union to play a full part in this international mechanism which would replace russian patrols near the security zone south of ossetia
7164995 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in the agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7164996 not envisaged by any agreement including the one which was mediated by the french president nicolas sarkozy
7164997 without a doubt failed to live up to their obligations
7164998 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7164999 today he just seemed a little flat up in the zone he made some mistakes and on top of that it seemed like every ball found a hole
7165000 lainy why do you have to struggle at losing weight when you look alright to me

7165003 its been a while since weve had the decathlon gold medal brought back to the states
7165004 ive always said my goal with track and field was to use it as a platform to help change lives
7165005 there are so many people who did so many things for me when i was growing up that kept me on the right path and ultimately allowed me to be where i am right now
7165006 osaka was a tough one because i really wanted to do well because of my heritage
7165007 it really was heart breaking for me not to do well there
7165008 i cant tell you how hot it was it was unbelievable it must have been over 100 degrees on the track
7165009 but for the uninitiated it the speech is something to enjoy

7165012 brad has changed my sister a lot they have an extraordinary bond ive never seen any sign of tension between them if it keeps going the way its going theyll be together for life
7165013 one of the teachers called some indian students derogatory names
7165014 my 10 year old son was lifted up by the ears by a male teacher and slapped and kicked for talking before entering the classroom after recess in february
7165015 these are young impressionable children and the alleged incidents will only teach them to hate

7165023 the strategy is right and we have lots of confidence we are doing the right thing
7165024 but if we do nothing more if theres no extra investment above what we have now we will go backwards
7165025 thats based on the amount of money other countries are investing even if we put a bit more money in well only tread water
7165026 i cant comment on any possible change in government or what that might mean
7165027 what i can say is that the past two weeks has reinforced to us that we are comfortable with the high performance system we have in place
7165028 weve had a number of countries comment on how well were doing but a lot more is needed
7165029 if someone wants to come along and change it then so be it but the work weve done in the past four years is starting to pay dividends and we cant sit back now
7165030 its like the americas cup how much is enough the focus for us is to be smart we cant afford wastage
7165031 and sooner or later its over i just dont want to miss you tonight

7165075 today the associated press whose articles are published in thousands of newspapers nationwide wrote a story about barack obamas vice presidential pick that sounded more like right wing fox than an unbiased news organization
7165076 this isnt an isolated incident for the ap reporter who wrote this story ron fournier who was recently appointed as the aps washington d
7165077 a congressional investigation recently uncovered an email fournier sent to karl rove in 2004 telling him to keep up the fight
7165078 but during the 2008 primary fournier wrote what amounted to a bunch of smear jobs on barack obama and the clintons
7165079 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7165080 turns out we had been looking at the demographics for harrisonburg louisiana population 800

7165124 the relays and the sprints are our signature events like it or not thats the way we are judged
7165125 we can win 35 medals in other events but if we dont do well in the sprints its something we feel extraordinarily bad about
7165126 i was walking around in london talking to people and they dont care the ordinary man on the street has no interest in china
7165127 the olympics will not change their views about china if they have got any views of china at all
7165128 the beijing olympic games are a milestone in the course of the great reinvigoration of the chinese nation
7165129 the success of the beijing olympic games has also reflected the great achievements china has scored after three decades of reform and opening up
7165130 theyll just remember what their country did theyll remember us eight times gold swimming medallist michael phelps theyll remember the people who won
7165131 its shown to the world and chinese government that people of conscience around the world will stand up and speak with solidarity for tibetans that they also support the tibetan cause
7165132 there are always some issues that come out with the games that seems to be endemic with the olympics
7165133 the message that this would be the no fun olympics got out pretty quickly everyone was doing stories quite rightly about bars being closed
7165134 think about world cup in germany think about what a big party that was thousands of people watching on streets sleeping in the parks a 24 hour party happening
7165135 they got to drink beer meet people sleep with girls that kind of thing
7165136 through the beijing olympic games the world has had a better knowledge of what china is like a country that makes constant progress emphasizes friendship and harmony keeps its promises and respects all international rules
7165137 john mccain doesnt know which of the 7 tables to sit at
7165138 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7165139 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7165140 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7165141 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded
7165142 i was in the hospital yesterday where i saw many civilian wounded the hospital was later destroyed by a georgian jet i dont know whether the wounded were still there
7165143 the precedent of kosovo is a terrible precedent which will de facto blow apart the whole system of international relations developed not over decades but over centuries they have not thought through the results of what they are doing at the end of the day it is a two ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face
7165144 we too would then have to proceed from the view that in order to be respected we must use brute force in other words armed force
7165145 as soon as georgia gets the promise to join nato from washington on the next day the real process to separate these two territories from georgia will begin
7165146 how else are we supposed to defend the rights of the russian passport holders
7165147 why shouldnt russia stand up to us imperialism and its georgian puppet saakashvili
7165148 surely if the people of south ossetia want to unite with north ossetia they should have the right
7165149 russian troops are in georgia just to ensure that the georgian army is disarmed and can no longer attack us
7165150 yes thats nice but we need to do something now
7165151 out of a group of 12 front line soldiers 2 were abkhazian 2 were armenian 1 armenian locally from sukhumi 1 from yerevan who was too young to go fight the good fight in karabakh and the rest were either from the north caucasus or from places like siberia what were they motivated by looting they had been promised houses with tangerine gardens they had been promised cars
7165152 the abkhaz separatists along with their allies were forced by the agreement to hold their advance and heavy bombardment of the city
7165153 a large number of civilians stayed in sukhumi and all schools were re opened on september 1st however abkhaz separatists north caucasian volunteers cossacks and russian special forces attacked sukhumi on september 16 at 8 am this marked the beginning of 12 days non stop fighting around the besieged sukhumi with intense fighting and human loss on both sides georgians who stayed in the city with some weapons were left without any defence from artillery or mechanised units the city was mercilessly bombed by russian air forces and separatist artillery on september 27 the city fell as units of abkhaz russians and confederation of mountain peoples of the caucasus cmpc stormed the house of the government of abkhazia one of the most horrific massacres of this war was waged on the civilian population of sukhumi after its downfall during the storming of the city close to 1 000 people perished as abkhaz formations overran the streets of the city the civilians who were trapped in the city were taken from their houses basements and apartment buildings
7165154 russia realises that no international organisation or group of states can replace our peace keeping efforts in this specific post soviet space
7165155 there are those who say that this is really about russia and the rules of the game for europe writ large for the caspian energy corridor
7165156 he closed the market in ergneti which was an outlet for contraband passing through south ossetia but also a point of sale for agricultural products from the regions of tskhinvali and gori this vast black market constituted in neutral territory a place of precious exchange the only economic integration of a highly divided region since its closure all contact between georgians and ossetians has become more difficult leading to an exacerbation of the alienation between the two sides in tskhinvali as in gori many see this closure as a major mistake in the region
7165157 do you agree that the republic of south ossetia should retain its current status as an independent state and be recognised by the international community
7165158 south ossetia should merge with north ossetia in the russian federation
7165159 tim ini telah menunjukkan kerjasama yang apik secara umum jelas kami ingin meraih hasil maksimal namun hasil imbang juga bukan hal buruk mengingat kami bermain dengan sepuluh pemain
7165160 di 45 menit pertama kami memang kalah dari dortmund namun setelah jeda kami berhasil memperbaiki diri dan berbalik menekan dortmund
7165161 oh shit im sorry i thought paper could protect you you asshole
7165162 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7165163 i think when people are looking at the olympics in 2012 britain home of football where football was invented which we gave to the world i think people would be very surprised if there is an olympic tournament in football and we are not part of it
7165164 i am determined to work with the football associations and the international olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7165165 he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7165166 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7165167 not only do all the national supporters associations oppose such a move but the majority of football associations in the uk have said they do not want to take part in a single uk team as it could threaten their existence within fifa
7165168 i will be 37 so im not sure i will still be playing but you never know at the end of day im just going to be happy to be involved
7165169 i will definitely be there but whether its playing or not im not so sure about that one
7165170 for me football is the best sport in the world so for me it should be top of the list
7165171 there are so many other great sports and so many other athletes who have worked so hard to get here but its still important
7165172 there are great players and great teams over here so its still my number one sport whether or not it is looked at as different
7165173 if you look at jamaica a small island nation they won gold silver and bronze in the womens sprint theyve got world records theyve won the mens the womens 100 and 200 metres and the relay
7165174 this is an exceptionally brilliant nation at the same time a small nation scotland can compete on the world stage we proved that in the olympics and a scottish team at the olympics is the future
7165175 we dont know how to explain this so when we dont know how to explain things in the medical world we call it a miracle and this is probably what happened
7165176 there have been a number of well documented case histories of adults and children who drowned in very cold water even trapped under ice for hours and were successfully revived many hours later
7165177 of course this is used routinely in modern cardiac bypass
7165178 there is some historical precedent for how this might work
7165179 many years ago some babies were put into ice water at birth to try to revive them there were reports that this actually could be effective and that some children survived
7165180 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
7165181 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
7165182 i assume youre not interested in conducting the interview any further
7165183 what is it that you people do at this company
7165184 i know this is off the subject but will you marry me
7165185 will the company move my rock collection from california to maryland
7165186 tienen el potencial de revolucionar la educaci n en formas que es dif cil de imaginar
7165187 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
7165188 creo que con este tema no hay que jugar no escatimamos nada los mexicanos y menos los priistas todo lo que ha requerido el presidente ha sido desde el punto de vista del pri apoyado por nosotros
7165189 pero no se vale que a la hora de las responsabilidades alguien pretenda evadir su deber legal y constitucional por prop sitos electorales

7165208 mama your concern over others sometimes land you in trouble mama niat baik tapi orang take advantage of you
7165209 i am not perfect yes noone is but it is wrong to take advantage of ones weaknesses hence my faith in allah strengthens me each time failures or obstacles greet my life
7165210 its not about our fear its about the people waiting in gaza you cant think about anything else
7165211 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7165212 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens of the world have when they organise together to stand against injustice
7165213 the olympic charter and filas own rules about fair play
7165214 we limit ourselves to ruling that fila must consistently with the olympic charter and general principles of fairness establish for the future a jury of appeal to determine the validity or otherwise of complaints of the kind ventilated by abrahamian
7165215 at the moment we are not planning to increase our holdings we are also not planning a sharp exit because this is decent paper and it is bringing us decent earnings
7165216 the ones in baghdad and diyala province just changed their t shirts there are large numbers who were really al qaeda we have to really look hard for those elements without blood on their hands
7165217 we want to have our cake and eat it too support maliki and the sons of iraq maliki wants to make that as hard for us as possible he wants us to choose him
7165218 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7165219 i hope russia companies will take part in the bidding
7165220 lukoil is welcome to bid for the service contract at the second or third stage of the tender in march or september
7165221 we are probably still on a growth trajectory before we get to the stage when the uk presence can begin to thin out
7165222 said celeste a wallander a russia scholar at georgetowns school of foreign service
7165223 if russias feeling churlish they can pretty much bring to a grinding halt any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7165224 weve spent so many resources and so much attention on iraq that weve lost sight of future threats down the road the current conflict between russia and georgia is a perfect example
7165225 this army of wretches infest all our political commentary about international politics
7165226 draw to themselves the power the wealth and the resources of other nations
7165227 the wretch who has been the author of more misery and suffering to the world than any being who ever lived before him after destroying the liberties of his country he has exhausted all its resources physical and moral to indulge his own maniac ambition his own tyrannical and overbearing spirit
7165228 the will of the allies there is no more moderation forbearance or even honesty in theirs than in that of bonaparte they have proved that their object like his is plunder
7165229 us foreign policy has utterly devastated our constitution which was drawn up so as to prevent presidents from roaming the planet entangled in many foreign treaties
7165230 if there is one principle more deeply rooted in the mind of every american it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest
7165231 each thing in its proper time there is a time for compassion for solidarity we will learn the lessons of this event
7165232 we had no more ammunition for our other weapons and we were left only with our famas assault rifles
7165233 with russia threatening to redraw the post soviet map of europe
7165234 hope youre all having a wonderful summer this is actually the first summer where i didnt just lounge around in st tropez or a private beach somewhere i didnt take a vacation this summer because its been non stop work
7165235 ive been shooting the show editing it traveling to europe to promote my handbag line and fragrance designing my fall collection for my shoes and clothing line and working in my studio on a new album so professionally its been a very successful and productive summer my favorite part of the summer has been the time ive gotten to spend on tour with my love benj we always have the best time together and hes played some shows in some pretty rad places orlando for example so we got to go to disney world which is always a blast hes such an amazing boyfriend and so talented too i love watching him perform on stage so hot loves it

7165243 you guys thought we were going to win the world series didnt you
7165244 within the last two weeks weve been riding on top
7165245 even though we got manny were not going to beat peoples brains out
7165246 were going to have to pitch and play defense were not going to go out there and outscore people
7165247 a big part of it is the top of the order
7165248 in order for the middle of the lineup to perform we have to put the pitcher in position to have to pitch to those guys
7165249 the younger guys are starting to play better to add some veteran players casey blake manny greg maddux absolutely makes us better were better at handling situations
7165250 i do miss that i get my fair share when we get out to the west coast
7165251 here they have their cheese steaks you can only eat so many of them
7165252 but nobody probably would have suspected id be here either
7165253 it came down to the opportunity to go to college during college age
7165254 they said i could always go back i wanted a normal college experience i figured if baseball was meant to be there would still be that opportunity after college
7165255 were built on homegrown products weve got to sign guys

7165259 i was returning really well but she replied back with a better return and then my second serve was easier for her she just stepped in and smashed it down the line cross court so i knew that i had to have my first serve percentage up
7165260 caroline is a good player she doesnt hit that hard but she plays quite consistent so against her i should play aggressive
7165261 i am having fun i enjoy playing for a big crowd when youre in the finals you dont have anything to lose you can just win

7165265 since my brother passed away i wasnt feeling like myself
7165266 summer track really helped a lot i couldnt have won nationals without god my family my coach friends and my boyfriend they really were supportive of me and helped me through a tough period in my life
7165267 he was there to support her and they help each other out a lot
7165268 they are very competitive with each other if one places high at a meet the other one wants to do just as well
7165269 the girls i will be competing with are pretty good but well see who the best is at the end of the day
7165270 he has high expectations this year and i think its going to be a monumental year for him
7165271 we still have the potential to be one of the best area teams
7165272 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
7165273 the weakest of all weak things is a virtue which has not been tested in the fire
7165274 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
7165275 if you know you put in the work youre going to dance and celebrate and pop some bottles i dont think thats disrespectful
7165276 for the first time foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china
7165277 have i been able to contribute to the olympic values
7165278 ever took himself and his own perfectness with such disconcerting seriousness as the modern white man
7165279 this tube was chasing me and i made it out i have defeated death again
7165280 thats a pretty absurd thing that you get so excited by going out there on this piece of foam and riding one of those wave things
7165281 it was an insult to the olympic vision to the spirit of taekwondo and for me an insult to mankind
7165282 their response was we are a hosting country and believing in sportsmanship we are willing to accept any outcome from the decision
7165283 yang pasti bukan dari dalam pdip tapi dari luar sebab kita di republik indonesia ini tidak mungkin sendirian harus sama sama dengan orang lain juga
7165284 nggak perlu ada dikotomi nasionalis atau tidak kalau dia nasionalis pasti religius atau sebaliknya yang pasti dia mendukung negara kesatuan republik indonesia uud 1945 dan setuju pancasila
7165285 a perfect storm of parking demand would be nice on an occasional basis
7165286 in some ways i think we pay more attention to what is going on than the rest of the country
7165287 but we want to hear real concrete answers not hope not change but how the next presidents policies affect our pocketbooks
7165288 if just six bush voters in each ohio precinct had been persuaded to vote the other way kerry would be the president
7165289 there had never been a large focus on how to build strategically something that lasts that has strong grassroots that mobilizes voters and moves the message
7165290 when ted strickland decided to run for governor in 2006 we decided that we needed to build the party from the grassroots up
7165291 kerry focused on only 16 counties out of our 88
7165292 he won 16 and lost 72 two years later strickland focused on all 88 counties he won 72 and lost 16
7165293 i worry about the underlying problems of the great society culture that obama wants to govern from
7165294 that way of governing created a movement which became a sub society of entitlement
7165295 i have a lot more faith in mccains ability to make decisions that are important to our country
7165296 i know he is criticized by republicans for making relationships with the democrats for me that is a plus
7165297 but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
7165298 then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7165299 we always knew it would be close its always difficult to beat an incumbent
7165300 shaheen spent 700 000 this summer and didnt move her numbers at all
7165301 the clinton people are all with us but we need more from the obama side to win this

7165305 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 percent reduction by 2050
7165306 in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood
7165307 we dont want to return to marginal rates of 60 or 70 percent
7165308 you look like me but you dont talk like me and you certainly dont think like me
7165309 its been a real plus we understand their culture and most of us speak tagalog and some speak another filipino language
7165310 these people grew up with the internet its always on its always with them and they use it to share information about what theyre doing and what theyre thinking
7165311 as a result the way they make decisions is to find out what their peers think and reach a consensus theyre not into expert wisdom and people with long resumes theyre much more likely to respond to messages in social networks like myspace or facebook than to traditional campaign messages
7165312 one of the most important forces in this nations social history in this century
7165313 they tend to be multilateralists in foreign policy they tend not to be concerned with social issues those things are decided for them theyre not upset about gay marriage for example
7165314 the american people do not want government to solve all our problems
7165315 provide immediate relief to working people who have lost their jobs families who have lost their homes and people who have lost their way
7165316 every american is empowered to be a watchdog and a whistle blower
7165317 every senior deserves to live out their life with dignity and respect
7165318 will save the typical family up to 2 500 per year
7165319 develop innovative transitional job programs that place unemployed people into temporary jobs and train them for permanent ones
7165320 we know we cant drill our way to energy independence
7165321 provide every child access to quality affordable early childhood education
7165322 we wont increase taxes on any family earning under 250 000 and we will offer additional tax cuts for middle class families
7165323 by dedicating a portion of the revenues generated by an economy wide cap and trade program
7165324 will rank among the worst presidents if not the worst in the history of our country
7165325 the constitutional right to bear arms restricts the actions of only the federal or state governments or their subdivisions not private actors
7165326 has been unable to cite any authority for its position
7165327 to have a gun in your car on set ital someone elses property end ital
7165328 i have clients that have to carry out terminations sometimes that termination is volatile a lot of places have a policy where they walk the terminated employee to his car what if you walk the guy to his car that has a gun i wouldnt want to be that supervisor
7165329 it took us a few days to shift some assets and get a clearer picture of what was actually going on
7165330 condi has dealt with moscow for so long as an academic that she has adopted a very mechanical view of the kind of relations we should have
7165331 heres a block of code dont run it now just register it to this event handler
7165332 man who supplied strippers to ny teen bash is shot
7165333 it will be alleged that dna material located at this crime scene matches the dna of the arrested man
7165334 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7165335 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7165336 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7165337 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7165338 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7165339 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7165340 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7165341 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7165342 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7165343 its a total diss to senator clinton in my opinion
7165344 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7165345 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7165346 i thought at times we did some really nice things like what weve been working on
7165347 i thought as the match went on we got a little sloppy
7165348 if we keep on tripling the number well get to nine and then 27 and before you know it well really have the numbers
7165349 so in some sense i have no idea how daunting this is thats why i was willing to take it on
7165350 and i figured if i dont run i cant complain
7165351 when my opponent was first elected to congress the cost of gasoline was about 1 20 a gallon under her watch gasoline has passed 4 a gallon a tankful of gasoline that used to cost 30 now costs 100
7165352 discredited government policies put in place by liberals such as the incumbent representative are responsible for 3 500 families suffering from job loss
7165353 my talking about the energy and federal issues can help the presidential race and the state assembly race
7165354 at the minimum peters contribution will be to make sure we have a debate on the serious issues facing our country
7165355 gather into a nice tight picture so it looks like theres thousands of people here
7165356 the founders wanted that debate instead of just having the seat constantly inhabited until death
7165357 im not too interested in being interviewed by the press

7165364 para m es importante que mis hijos est n orgullosos del ser humano que soy y que el p blico respete mi arte el artista y el humano que soy no s lo aspiro a ser un gran artista aspiro a ser un gran ser humano
7165365 esa diversidad es importante para un artista porque le permite explorar diferentes personajes de lo contrario el p blico te ve como un artista unidimensional y si voy a ser una persona unidimensional para eso trabajo en un banco y hago lo mismo todos los d as

7165375 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7165376 mahirap talaga ang buhay pag walang huling isda ang aming tatay wala rin kaming makain life was hard during times when father had no catch we also had nothing to eat
7165377 war was at its peak people were starving there was no choice but to leave
7165378 sabi niya drug queen daw ako sa barangay culiat the officer said i was a drug queen in culiat village
7165379 there were days we have as many as 10 people coming to our office to complain about hulidap
7165380 we dont tolerate these muslims who are involved in illegal activities
7165381 pag naisip ko yon naiiyak ako i cry whenever i remember it
7165382 we are committed to discipline our people we cannot allow undesirables in our roster
7165383 i cannot understand why the media have to identify a suspect as a muslim why is there a need to include somebodys religion they should just identify the name
7165384 what we lost at the break changed the race around considerably
7165385 the first fraction was 22 13 and we probably went 21 60 if she breaks cleanly shes going in 21 60 by herself she just took too much out of herself at the start to hold on all the way thats just horse racing weve won some at the expense of other people too
7165386 she was standing good but when the gate opened she just didnt fire away from there
7165387 i was perfectly willing to sit behind them but the horses in front of me drifted way out and let me up in there so i let her be where she normally is on the lead when i asked her at the head of the lane she responded real well and held off that other horse as long as she could
7165388 i havent wanted to fly her around but ive been forced to do that
7165389 there are never any races for her around here i guess they dont want to see hystericalady run here
7165390 the horse is undefeated on this turf course were already here hes training well and by posting a 102 beyer speed figure he deserves a chance
7165391 he ran a huge race down the lane last time he was really firing his legs in front of him well see if we fit in this bracket if he could repeat that last race hell be in the hunt somewhere
7165392 i wanted to wait for the race at golden gate fields the grade 3 200 000 all american stakes on sept 27 but the horses last couple of workouts were so good that mike owner willman wanted to take a shot
7165393 it gives us enough time for the race back at golden gate anyway hopefully we can win this race weve outrun awesome gem and been close to student council and go between
7165394 mike feels its a disadvantage with an out of town rider versus local riders
7165395 weve done all we can do if all of us could have a good day it would be a gold star for northern california
7165396 aside from continued food assistance what we really need are sleeping mats mosquito nets and blankets
7165397 it is not just about a person hit by a bullet but those of deprived of their education because schools have been disrupted by the fighting conflict makes people suffer
7165398 we are building water reservoirs and distributing hygiene kits aside from mattresses and mosquito nets
7165399 we bought the tent at the market so the children and our belongings would not get wet when there would be rains my husband would sleep outside our covered cart because it could not longer accommodate him
7165400 we are really very pitiful we really want to go home but we are afraid because the situation is still dangerous
7165401 our four hectare farm of corn and coconuts is waiting but our village is a hot spot we are still afraid to go home
7165402 how i wish peace will reign in our midst we are tired of being displaced
7165403 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7165404 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7165405 felipes going to be hard to beat but well certainly push for it
7165406 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes for today
7165407 the race will therefore be more difficult but as were on a street course anything is possible in the race
7165408 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me
7165409 after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is a small gap to ferrari and mclaren
7165410 fool me once shame on you fool me six times shame on mike brown
7165411 since august five we have added 14 international routes we have 20 wide body aircraft in our fleet now and will add another two soon with this we will further expand our network and add more flights
7165412 as far as the upa is concerned its stand has been clear on the simi evident from its appeal in the apex court against the order lifting the ban
7165413 its a confidential deal and the buyer wants anonymity but i can tell you it is not mr trump and its not republican presidential candidate john mccain
7165414 this year one of my goals is not to stress just
7165415 a ten per cent increase is possible if the fuel prices do not come down significantly the indian aviation industry has suffered a collective loss of about one billion us dollars last year
7165416 we see things improving but we are not at all out of the woods
7165417 the room to manoeuvre at this moment is limited any marginal changes in the prices will not enable us to make any significant move
7165418 ive got no control over this disease and im bloody terrified i am going
7165419 gambari said the government had allowed the meeting with daw aung san suu kyi even at her house but it was suu kyi who refused to see him
7165420 im going to prepare to play as well as i can
7165421 if thats not good enough its not good enough there hasnt been any mention of if it doesnt go well obviously if you dont play well enough you dont deserve to be on the field
7165422 i take it as what is j t is the starter and im the no 2 im going to continue to prepare and get ready knowing i am one play away im familiar with that obviously having gone through it last year im going to continue to prepare as if i was playing
7165423 this is a new role for me to get to watch another guy play
7165424 theres ups and downs in this game everyone goes through it its a new role for me im going to take it on and make the best of it
7165425 early on maybe a better job of picking up how this offense works i came to work prepared i felt like i put a lot into getting into this playbook and really trying to understand it i dont know if i have any regrets i pushed myself as hard as i could
7165426 not given the way things have gone the last three weeks weve looked good under osullivan and the offense is moving the ball well
7165427 thats neither here nor there the decision was made we just have to move on
7165428 it didnt waver when one gm or one personnel guy or one coach told me i wasnt good enough for that team
7165429 but if i could prove i could play in instructional league and then come back here ill have a little peace of mind going into the offseason
7165430 if he feels great and throws well in instructional ball i wouldnt rule out the possibility of him getting on the mound before the seasons over hes worked hard and it sure would be a big step for him but not necessary
7165431 the way they adjust to pitches id say its comparable they go with the pitch well and could hit a tough pitch you think you could make a good pitch on them they find a way to get the good part of the bat on the ball
7165432 senates do have a watchdog role australians dont want a rubber stamp senate
7165433 and i think some in the liberal party wish they were saved from workchoices with a senate that could have blocked it
7165434 we got some decisions wrong as the previous government and thats why were out of government
7165435 ive always believed we should have a more robust senate
7165436 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7165437 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7165438 i know that joe will campaign well for and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7165439 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7165440 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7165441 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7165442 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7165443 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7165444 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7165445 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7165446 o iraque est passando por um dos momentos mais dif ceis porque todos est o especulando como lucrar com suas riquezas todos sabem que a lei do petr leo n o beneficia o povo iraquiano que s serve ao bush seus apoiadores e as empresas multinacionais
7165447 if we could educate people about neutering and spaying we wouldnt be out here today
7165448 i was caught between a rock and a hard place
7165449 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7165450 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7165451 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7165452 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7165453 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7165454 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7165455 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7165456 everyone in our league has the idea they can win the league i dont think theyre wrong about that i think everyone has the ability to beat everyone else
7165457 everyone in our league has the idea they can win the league
7165458 i think everyone has the ability to beat everyone else
7165459 we have high expectations for ourselves and how were going to compete on a nightly basis
7165460 the last couple of years we were playing bigger schools these schools are our size theyre more at our level
7165461 it wont play its my cd players fault ill take it to the park and play some frisbee golf
7165462 the real test of the new teams leadership will come in the first half of next year that is when palm plans to announce a next generation of software and a new device which it hopes will make it easier for consumers to surf the web and network with friends and colleagues
7165463 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else is because she demanded in her original contract that no one could ever get paid more than her
7165464 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world
7165465 but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7165466 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7165467 we are first and foremost an organisation devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7165468 placing sport at the service of mankind and leveraging olympic values to promote better understanding between people nations and religions stands at the core of our mission
7165469 the gold medal match is always bittersweet for the loser
7165470 weve got to look at it as we got here and won a silver medal nobody expected it we knew deep down inside that we were that good we came out here in this tournament and fought our hearts out
7165471 we knew the match was going to be very difficult
7165472 brazil is definitely the best team in this tournament id like to congratulate brazil it was a wonderful performance theyve been working so many years actually they had lots of chances but this time they got it id like to congratulate my team my assistants my players i think they had a very good tournament
7165473 pedimos que nos digan exactamente cu les son las dificultades que est n encontrando
7165474 love me tomorrow wont you please promise me love me tomorrow like today love me tomorrow hurry back cant you see i need you more than any words could say
7165475 were letting people know right now especially as we get to the middle and latter part of next week we could see some life threatening flooding going on
7165476 weve been through all the storms that have been here and survived just fine so i think its just going to be fine
7165477 were looking at a high potential for flooding not so much right now on saturday but as we get into the weekend and by next week
7165478 if you live near creeks that normally rise very quickly if you live in low lying areas or you live in areas where the roads get impassable when you get heavy rain you might want to have some plans to get out quickly
7165479 if you cant see the road dont take a chance if you dont know the depth of it

7165498 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7165499 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7165500 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7165501 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7165502 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7165503 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personal to step up in his absence
7165504 pensamos que hay en realidad m s planetas que estrellas

7165508 hell i didnt read it to the back end i got as far as the front end
7165509 the naval war of 1812 you know because hed heard rumors of this place called new orleans

7165519 georgia has stood for freedom around the world now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
7165520 which eventually attain policy dynamics of their own and become a burden on the government and or confuse the policy making process
7165521 georgia is a semi democracy we have traded one kind of semi democratic system for another there is a real need to understand that what happened is another one party government emerged
7165522 uncertain democracy u s foreign policy and georgias rose revolution
7165523 if we declare victory prematurely as i think the bush administration has done it is not good for democracy generally and not good for georgia in particular
7165524 relative to its self image and the way it is portrayed in the united states georgia is not a pristine democracy
7165525 has not even come close to finishing its democratic evolution it still has a long way to go on many fronts and we are committed to helping georgia move even deeper in its democratic evolution
7165526 i was excited to go to georgia i thought it had real prospects
7165527 but i couldnt have been more disappointed in terms of being able to accomplish anything
7165528 georgia has made enormous strides in governmental reform but must improve the effectiveness of key institutions strengthen political pluralism and increase public participation to truly consolidate its democratic gains
7165529 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7165530 i thought they would kill us i was very much afraid
7165531 georgian units are concentrated in the central part of the republic and are preparing for further actions
7165532 georgian special forces are setting up arms caches in order among other things to carry out provocations on the territory of south ossetia and neighboring districts
7165533 im unlikely to see another nation come to maturity like china has with this olympics
7165534 theyre really staging this its really choreographed its not sustainable
7165535 but theres a lot that is fake its lost a lot of its unique character
7165536 i constantly get the feeling that i shouldnt say anything that could be a slur against china i feel a lot of pressure to get the image
7165537 id like to come back after the olympics and see what its really like
7165538 if brazil had a stronger central government wed probably avoid a lot of anarchy like robberies and people being kidnapped
7165539 a lot of people who wouldnt come to china will consider it now
7165540 it does bring the country into the fold of the international community
7165541 i asked her how could someone burn their own history
7165542 she became very uncomfortable she told me i wouldnt understand she didnt try to explain
7165543 we should make contributions to the country i understand we are a socialist family
7165544 thats right because i ordered the gift for you the manufacturer had to send it to you

7165548 ok so i hear her open the outer box and when she sees the box inside wrapped apparently very extravagantly and in pink ribbon she exclaims as she is wont to do
7165549 why arent you casas anymore why are you lopez now
7165550 things didnt get good until 10 pm but i went anyway except your abuelito made my tio to o accompany me as my chaperone

7165559 in 1986 peter davies was on holiday in kenya after graduating from northwestern university
7165560 on a hike through the bush he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air the elephant seemed distressed so peter approached it very carefully
7165561 he got down on one knee and inspected the elephants foot and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it
7165562 twenty years later peter was walking through the brookfield zoo with his teenage son
7165563 remembering the encounter in 1986 peter couldnt help wondering if this was the same elephant
7165564 one of the reasons why its possible the reserve bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong because the surplus is very substantial
7165565 thered be no way known the reserve bank would be able to contemplate putting down interest rates again
7165566 its slowing somewhat but the reserve bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of 2 per cent
7165567 what this country needs from the government is the preparation and delivery of an economy statement which sets out the international economic environment in which australia finds itself
7165568 it is not a political statement it is a statement which reflects the gravity of economic circumstances in which the country finds itself
7165569 most importantly what are the governments specific policy prescriptions to address the challenges that this country now faces
7165570 i dont think theres a place for a mini budget but theres certainly a place for a strong economic statement
7165571 the mid year economic fiscal outlook is really a statement of facts and i think it requires more than that
7165572 if the people continue to vote for me i aign will be their prime minister for life
7165573 in a country that wants to be a democracy the people spoke and the people spoke for democracy and against unlimited power
7165574 its o k ryder i fall down too youre o k friend you are getting stronger and stronger every day
7165575 all the hard work we had to do and overcome everybody saying that we didnt have a whole lot of time together how would the chemistry work how would this work everything came together and its amazing i dont have any words on how i feel right now
7165576 our depth is what helped us get through this tournament and helped us get those double digit wins those 20 30 point wins just because other teams didnt have that rotation
7165577 she was very proud of me and i was very proud of her
7165578 she was telling me that i got better since weve been together and she loved the way that i worked half of that goes to her because i mind her and i try to model some of the things that she does it was a very emotional time at that moment we were just congratulating each other letting each other know how happy we were
7165579 im going to take it back to minneapolis and i know they are going to go crazy when i get back there and then from there its going home
7165580 my mom is really really tight and secure with my trophies and things like that so i know this is going in the safety box or safe or something like that
7165581 it will be alleged that dna material located at this crime scene matches the dna of the arrested man
7165582 this investigation is a further illustration of the value of dna evidence to police investigators
7165583 our whole genome analysis supports placing the placozoans after the sponge lineage branched from other animals
7165584 trichoplax has had just as much time to evolve as humans but because of its morphological simplicity it is tempting to think of it as a surrogate for an early animal
7165585 the latest and most complex analysis again suggests that placozoans populated the oceans long before sponges evolved
7165586 the outcome of the trichoplax adhaerens genome sequencing is so exciting that we are now culturing another 13 placozoan species in order to identify the most basal placozoan lineage and genome
7165587 trichoplax is an ancient lineage a good representation of the ancestral genome that is shedding light of the kinds of genes the structures of genes and even how these genes were arranged on the genome in the common ancestor 600 million years ago
7165588 it has retained a lot of primitive features relative to other living animals
7165589 it lacks a nervous system but it still is able to respond to environmental stimuli
7165590 it has genes such as ion channels and receptors that we associate with neuronal functions but no neurons have ever been reported
7165591 some of our new placozoan species show frequent sexual reproduction while others never show any signs of sex
7165592 the genome data allow us to search for the genes responsible for sex and life cycle complexity
7165593 its remarkable that we have the whole genome sequence but we still know so little about this animal in the wild
7165594 hopefully the genome sequence will stimulate more studies of this enigmatic creature

7165599 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
7165600 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7165601 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
7165602 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach
7165603 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
7165604 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists

7165668 but if i could prove i could play in instructional league and then come back here ill have a little peace of mind going into the offseason
7165669 if he feels great and throws well in instructional ball i wouldnt rule out the possibility of him getting on the mound before the seasons over hes worked hard and it sure would be a big step for him but not necessary
7165670 the way they adjust to pitches id say its comparable they go with the pitch well and could hit a tough pitch you think you could make a good pitch on them they find a way to get the good part of the bat on the ball
7165671 hardens been great when hes on hes very very good
7165672 we knew if we could add him to a rotation of carlos zambrano ryan dempster and ted lilly it would really help us the trade rounded off our 12 man pitching staff very well
7165673 gave positive input on how he could be used and weve followed that

7165701 i came out here ready and prepared when you come to the olympics its the biggest stage i did my best the track was great
7165702 i worked hard to get here it wasnt an easy road
7165703 the track is fast i said to asafa powell and my coach glen mills that anybody who wins is going to break the world record
7165704 a lot of guys came to me and said theyve been inspired
7165705 i said to them you have to be relaxed we know were capable of doing it youve got to enjoy what you do
7165706 yes i guess ive had a little bit of an impact people have gone out there and enjoyed themselves
7165707 i wouldnt say im a phenomenon im just a great athlete
7165708 i try and stay relaxed by messing around and not thinking too much about the race
7165709 i dont allow people to put pressure on me you might not be focused enough when i enjoy myself i stay focused
7165710 ill still enjoy myself im still young ill still train hard ill try to keep on top for as long as i can
7165711 running is enjoyable you have to enjoy what you do
7165712 its a job for us athletes its like working to not enjoy it it doesnt make sense
7165713 i enjoy it i love it sometimes you think about quitting at training because thats hard
7165714 but it also makes success more great when you work hard for it

7165937 the english patient is it any good the movie bored me to sleep
7165938 i certainly would scully if i thought you could be trusted
7165939 i know if i let my guard down for a second it would be my life youd kill me and not think twice isnt that true
7165940 what do you want bored with raping mulder decided to go after me
7165941 i should have expected that from you cheap shot im no rapist besides i like my boys boys and if there has to be a woman i prefer her to be all woman
7165942 so what is it are you going to kill me so you can have mulder all to yourself
7165943 i watched your sister die in this room i watched her hit the floor and i thought it was you
7165944 should i whisper to you about how her hair fanned out how she slumped to the ground how the blood began to flow should i tell you how good it felt when your boyfriend mulder sucked me dry
7165945 tell me what you want but you know what i want to know
7165946 i see youve gotten very good with double entendres scully
7165947 ive worked with mulder for five years something of him has rubbed off on me
7165948 you know hes theres something very wrong with him and you havent been helping with that what infidelity attitude
7165949 oh so youd prefer the screaming shrew from hell tactic
7165950 shes a bitch you are being a bitch in a way a man cannot handle youre acting the saint youre chewing his stomach out for the pleasure of watching him squeal ive never understood you why youre so cruel to him
7165951 what the hell are you thinking krycek what the hell do you know
7165952 i came over here maybe to kill you you know but i know what that would do to mulder and i couldnt do it

7165957 why because our love for special agent mulder is so overwhelming that we can put aside our jealousies and our difficulties for him

7165963 im not open minded enough to consider a threesome between you and me and mulder it sort of turns my stomach
7165964 im more along the lines of that were separate parts of mulders life that could stay separate
7165965 krycek before we start fighting over our boyfriend do recall you killed my sister distracted mulder so i could get abducted and experimented on for three months and youre a lying doublecrossing son of a bitch not to mention what you and mulder are doing so lets just remember that okay
7165966 this is not a romantic comedy and i am definitely not in the mood
7165967 but understanding mulder means understanding you and frankly beyond the enigma of why he wants you mulders easy he feels like he could succeed but control keeps getting taken away from him from samantha on he resents it but he takes it on the off chance he can trick victory out of something

7166066 some days more than others i think i might hold off on re naming ill try to find some creative juices lying about somewhere and oil up the cogs in the right side of my brain and both
7166067 as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
7166068 hey thats pretty cool im not done with my life there are lots of things id like to try yet and lots of life to live
7166069 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
7166070 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual
7166071 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
7166072 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7166073 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans
7166074 when you consume ordinary noodles made from wheat or corn you may soon feel your stomach empty but this soybean noodle delays such a feeling of hunger
7166075 were all flat chested otherwise we wouldnt need to be feminists
7166076 oh theres lots of big breasts theyre very big theyre scary somebody might get their eye put out im going to vote for buchanan
7166077 there are a lot of big breasts around ergo we get scared and we get conservative
7166078 oh theres lots of small breasts around its okay its safe im going to join a commune and take drugs
7166079 he would never approach a small breasted woman like ms willey
7166080 the story of the man who turned into a female breast
7166081 a big brainless bag of dumb desirable tissue acted upon instead of acting unguarded immobile hanging
7166082 this view the breast as dumb blond has gone almost completely out of fashion as the classical cream puff style of dumb blond the dumb blond who was too dumb to know that you were fucking her has given way to the ditzy less sexual dumb blond like suzanne somers who was the master of her own thighs
7166083 i have to fit into a lot of molds and feel good about all of them
7166084 i know that curves give me the extra confidence for all the roles we play during the day
7166085 share that self confidence and initiative with someone who needs it
7166086 pick a pix choose a note send your messages of support and understanding to friends and family you have the power spread it around
7166087 it seems so many women are forced to limit their wardrobe because they dont like how they look in a particular outfit
7166088 ive had many women call and say they wear their curves with their wonderbra
7166089 if youre hot you do like the people in bahrain where its 100 degrees by 10 a m
7166090 you wear long flowing robes so youre shielded from the sun and get maximum air circulation the real reason girls show a lot of skin in the summer is that the heat creates an excuse to show off a body fleetingly in its youthful prime you put on a halter top you say god i look fabulous in this you think about how youll be sixty in no time and wont be able to incite male lust and you put on the halter top and shorts and walk out the door
7166091 i dont think that the fact that breasts can be seen more does anything to take away peoples desire to see breasts
7166092 i know that breast men find not just arousal but comfort and relief from anxiety in the breast from fondling the breast the warmth of the breast resting their head on the breast suckling the breast there are men who prefer small breasts but theyre not men who prefer breasts they prefer that breasts not get in the way
7166093 when they started making the mega augmented breast there was an interest because it was so cartoonishly fascinating the men wanted to see them but then as they went to strip clubs and saw them and saw them begin to deteriorate and deform and they began to see the obvious scars the horror factor took over and it occurred to them that these were not soft breasts and the trend just evaporated

7166123 its a group thing were doing versus a couple of people its making a big difference eleven guys running to the football every play makes us a much better team
7166124 a lot of guys got experience last year as we had some injuries and things happen
7166125 guys got into the starting lineup and its paying dividends this year
7166126 were not quite as big as most of other teams but were just as aggressive and faster than lot of teams
7166127 we can blitz at any time we want we can get around the field real well
7166128 our defensive linemen are more like linebackers our athleticism will contribute to our success
7166129 if we have some injuries it could make things a little harder

7166179 the issues that affect blacks are also american issues that others should be aware of and concerned about
7166180 ive come to the tentative stance that my ideal news channel would not be a black one per se but one that seriously analyzes black issues in the context of broader news and connects to others beyond blacks
7166181 theres a host of evidence noting that men who cannot fulfill the breadwinner role often experience distress and interruptions in positive engagement in family life
7166182 approximately 1 000 to 5 000 cases that will necessitate collection effort

7166196 the avalanche has started it is too late for the
7166197 instead of making us all give a damn however this overwhelming surge of negative news is simply making us all more jaded
7166198 this looks like the best choice now but well meet regularly to confirm as things change
7166199 lets collectively understand whats happening here and explore our options together
7166200 there are tools for being in the chaos individually i think these include presencing practices discerning and sitting and journaling and making sense of things socially i think these are practices of simply being in community in a skillful way like a jazz ensemble so collective presencing i would recommend you flesh that section out a bit because people want you to be able to offer something in that area 5 corner

7166226 what do you discuss at your kitchen table at night
7166227 is it going to be economically worthwhile for existing anime publishers
7166228 2007 was a great year for us boosted mainly by the runaway success of in the night garden
7166229 these figures are fantastic to see especially given the fact that we only launched product in summer its a brand that has really captured the imaginative consciousness of parents and pre schoolers
7166230 our focus now will be on developing the longevity of the in the night garden brand teletubbies is still a huge hit for us 10 years on so we want to ensure were looking at a long term strategy for night garden from the outset
7166231 bbc drama is always looking for diverse and surprising pieces and being human hit the spot with its irreverence and wit
7166232 of all our recent drama experiments on bbc3 being human struck the most powerful chord with the audience at its heart is a bold and adventurous concept and im looking forward to seeing how this is realised across a series
7166233 as many of this years 9pm dramas are still on air no decisions have yet been made on recommissions

7166239 some people are calling for c4 to ban the programme because they say it portrays muslims negatively what do you think
7166240 does it show any kind of consideration for the relatives of people who died on 7 7 i ended up thinking well yes we dont do them a service by portraying these people as insane that would be as silly as saying the entire german nation was in the grip of a mass psychosis during the latter half of the 1930s its clear there are second generation muslims who are contemplating extreme action who are not monsters i think the way to do a service to the relatives and friends of those who died on 7 7 is to try to stop it happening again and the first step is to try to understand how it could have happened in the first place
7166241 liberty if it means anything is the right to tell people what they dont want to hear

7166244 when i discovered the secret i made a decision that i would not watch the news or read newspapers anymore because it did not make me feel good
7166245 how does it work nobody knows just like nobody knows how electricity works i dont do you

7166257 you cant always change your circumstances but you can always change your attitude
7166258 there is a grain of truth in there namely optimistic people tend to be more successful than pessimistic people

7166270 if we assume that the most parsimonious theory is correct then doesnt that lead us to a sort of berkeley the bishop not the city type conclusion that the only thing that is real is god i mean thats only one entity in existence and thus is the most parsimonious theory
7166271 the trick would be to start a magical sounding thing then announce it had all been absolute bullshit
7166272 if i do good i feel good if i do bad i feel bad thats my religion
7166273 how does it work nobody knows just like nobody knows how electricity works i dont do you
7166274 if youre accusing me of fabricating things i think thats a serious charge
7166275 utter disregard for the truth or falsity of salary affidavits he signed when he knew he had delayed matters pending

7166281 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7166282 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7166283 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7166284 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7166285 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7166286 senates do have a watchdog role australians dont want a rubber stamp senate
7166287 and i think some in the liberal party wish they were saved from workchoices with a senate that could have blocked it
7166288 we got some decisions wrong as the previous government and thats why were out of government
7166289 ive always believed we should have a more robust senate
7166290 there should be more discussion in the senate and people should see senators using their heads and voting accordingly rather than as directed
7166291 were going to be running into some desperate teams teams that are fighting for their lives
7166292 we certainly dont go into any game not expecting a tough game
7166293 after that canberra game is was just a matter of us getting our confidence back in each other and obviously it was a game that took a fair bit out of us
7166294 credit to the boys they turned it around by thrashing the bulldogs 52 16 last week
7166295 we definitely know how hard it is going to be against the storm but if we play to our potential anything can happen
7166296 the more we can cut down on flights and the better we can recover between games the more it will help us later on
7166297 biden ha denunciado el pobre juicio de obama en pol tica internacional y ha alegado en sus propias palabras lo que los estadounidense han comenzado a comprender que barack obama no est listo para ser presidente
7166298 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7166299 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7166300 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7166301 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7166302 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7166303 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7166304 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7166305 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas
7166306 ive spoken with armed forces commander in chief general luis trigo who has precise instructions to safeguard and defend the bolivian people
7166307 the government will protect the oil pipelines and gas valves
7166308 medicine is scarce and there is only one doctor and a few nurses that shows how we are unable to cope
7166309 now the town is calm but we are still skeptical about the situation
7166310 the possibility of the defeated militia or any other troops challenging the islamic militia who are now in control of kismayo is not simple or realistic
7166311 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7166312 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7166313 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes obama made a very wise selection
7166314 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties countries
7166315 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done
7166316 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7166317 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7166318 im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7166319 i was an irish catholic kid with a father like many of yours in tough economic times and fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe my dad repeated it its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7166320 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7166321 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7166322 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7166323 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7166324 in all my years in the senate i have never in my life seen washington so broken
7166325 ladies and gentlemen that is what he said you cant change america when you support george bushs policies 95 per cent of the time
7166326 he brings experience he brings maturity hes his own man who can tell you youre wrong with a smile on his face
7166327 i like the combination of youth and experience hes a senior just like me
7166328 has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7166329 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7166451 varios iraqu es aprehendieron el martes a dos estadounidenses disfrazados de rabes mientras trataban de hacer volar un coche entrampado con explosivos en medio de un rea residencial en el oeste de bagdad residentes del distrito de bagdad oeste al ghazaliyah dijeron que la gente hab a aprehendido a los estadounidenses cuando abandonaban su coche caprice cerca de un vecindario residencial en al ghazaliyah el martes por la tarde la gente local consider que parec an sospechosos as que detuvieron a los hombres antes de que se escaparan entonces descubrieron que eran estadounidenses y llamaron a la polic a
7166452 la polic a iraqu lleg aproximadamente al mismo tiempo que fuerzas militares aliadas y los dos hombres fueron sustra dos a la custodia iraqu y se los llevaron r pidamente antes de que pudiera tener lugar alg n interrogatorio
7166453 gente del rea afirma que se llevaron al hombre no porque hubiera disparado contra alguien sino porque sab a demasiado sobre la bomba se rumorea que lo que vio fue a una patrulla estadounidense que pas por el rea y se detuvo en el sitio del atentado minutos antes de la explosi n poco despu s de que se alejaron estall la bomba y sobrevino el caos sali corriendo de su casa y grit a los vecinos y a los espectadores que los estadounidenses hab an colocado la bomba o visto la bomba sin hacer nada al respecto se lo llevaron r pidamente
7166454 fuera a un campo militar estadounidense cerca del aeropuerto de bagdad para ser interrogado y a fin de recuperar su licencia
7166455 el conductor se fue apurado pero pronto lo alarm un sentimiento de que su coche transportaba un peso considerable y tambi n entr en sospechas debido a un helic ptero que volaba bajo y se manten a por encima como si lo fuera siguiendo
7166456 la unidad de contraterrorismo del fbi ha lanzado una amplia investigaci n de contubernios de robo basados en ee uu despu s de descubrir que algunos veh culos utilizados en mort feros atentados con coches en irak incluyendo ataques en los que murieron soldados de ee uu y civiles iraqu es fueron probablemente robados en ee uu seg n altos responsables del gobierno de ee uu
7166457 la investigaci n comenz despu s de que tropas de la coalici n allanaron una f brica de bombas en faluya en noviembre pasado y encontraron un todo terreno registrado en texas que estaba siendo preparado para un misi n con bombas
7166458 no excluye una participaci n occidental en el atentado de esta semana contra la mezquita askariya
7166459 la pregunta esencial es qui bono qui n se beneficia con algo semejante no hay que ser muy conspiracionista o siquiera paranoico para sugerir que anda por ah todo un mont n de sospechosos probables ya sabe oficiales brit nicos fueron arrestados vestidos con trajes rabes andando por ah en un coche as que este asunto suma y sigue
7166460 data de una estrategia a n secreta en la batalla del gobierno de reagan contra la insurgencia guerrillera izquierdista en el salvador a comienzos de los a os ochenta
7166461 una propuesta del pent gono enviar a a equipos de las fuerzas especiales para asesorar apoyar y posiblemente entrenar a escuadrones iraqu es cuidadosamente escogidos para atacar a insurgentes y sus simpatizantes incluso cruzando la frontera con siria seg n militares informados familiarizados con las discusiones
7166462 el pent gono considera la formaci n de escuadrones para atacar a dirigentes de la insurgencia iraqu en un giro estrat gico emprestado de la lucha estadounidense contra guerrillas izquierdistas en centroam rica hace 20 a os
7166463 escuadrones de ataque ser an controvertidos y probablemente mantenidos en secreto
7166464 john negroponte el embajador de ee uu en bagdad ocup un asiento de primera fila en la poca como embajador en honduras de 1981 a 1985
7166465 lo que es especialmente impresionante es que muchos de esos asesinatos tuvieron lugar desde que los comandos de la polic a entraron en actividad de un modo operativo y a menudo corresponden a reas en las que hab an sido desplegados
7166466 yo fui soldado en el ej rcito iraqu en la guerra de 1991 y durante la retirada de kuwait decid buscar asilo en arabia saud junto con docenas de otros como yo entonces comenz el proceso mediante el cual fui reclutado por las fuerzas estadounidenses porque hab a all comit s militares de ee uu que escogieron a una serie de iraqu es dispuestos a ofrecerse como voluntarios para unirse a ellos y ser transportados a ee uu yo fui uno de ellos
7166467 realizar tareas espec ficas que le fueron asignadas por las agencias de ee uu
7166468 a cargo de un grupo de una unidad que realizaba asesinatos en las calles de bagdad
7166469 nuestra tarea era realizar asesinatos de individuos el ej rcito de ocupaci n de ee uu nos suministraba sus nombres fotos y mapas de sus movimientos diarios hacia y desde su lugar de residencia y se esperaba que mat semos a chi es en y a sun es en madinat as sadr etc
7166470 mataban a cualquiera de la unidad que cometiera un error tres miembros de mi equipo fueron muertos por las fuerzas de ocupaci n de ee uu despu s de que no asesinaron a personalidades pol ticas sun es en bagdad
7166471 no s lo realiza asesinatos sino algunos de sus miembros se especializan en la colocaci n de bombas y coches bomba en vecindarios y mercados
7166472 las operaciones de colocaci n de coches bomba y del uso de explosivos en mercados son realizadas de diferentes maneras las m s conocidas y m s famosas entre los soldados de ee uu son la colocaci n de bombas dentro de coches cuando eran registrados en los puntos de control otra manera es la colocaci n de bombas en los coches durante interrogatorios despu s la persona deseada es citada a una de las bases de ee uu se coloca una bomba en su coche y se le pide que conduzca a una comisar a o a un mercado con alg n prop sito y all hacen estallar su coche
7166473 la evidencia de que ee uu contribuy directamente a la creaci n de la actual guerra civil en iraq mediante su propia estrategia secreta de seguridad es convincente hist ricamente por supuesto esto no es nada nuevo dividir para gobernar es una estrategia de los poderes coloniales que ha resistido el paso del tiempo por cierto fue utilizada en la anterior ocupaci n brit nica de iraq hace unos 85 a os sin embargo es posible que en el actual escenario a ee uu se la haya pasado un poco la mano creando un impulso incontenible que aunque contuvo a la insurgencia ha llevado en realidad a nuevos problemas de control y sostenibilidad para washington y londres

7166524 you have a wonderful husband and children whats all this about wanting a career
7166525 an attractive woman is definitely going to get a longer interview but she wont get a job
7166526 they think that if you work hard youll get ahead t hat someone in authority will reach down and give you a promotion
7166527 most women and blacks are so frightened that people will think theyve gotten ahead because of their sex or color that they play down their visibility
7166528 its ridiculous for the kids to pay all that money for rent it makes sense for kids to stay at home
7166529 what i considered a social drink my dad considered an alcohol problem

7166535 people tend to treat the brain as if it were made up of color coded transistors
7166536 but its not simply a clever network of switches there are lots of important things going on inside the brain cells themselves
7166537 we believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain
7166538 age doesnt matter its good science that matters and this is good science
7166539 i think they didnt take me very seriously because im a kid
7166540 with mars the scientific stakes are arguably higher than they have ever been
7166541 when youve got people who believe in talking snakes raining frogs and a man living in a whale youve hit the comedy jackpot
7166542 we had a number of situations similar to that this is just a topic that gets people going
7166543 in that sense it was a dirty trick otherwise nobody would have talked to me
7166544 the working title was a spiritual journey we didnt tell anybody especially in america that i was in the movie
7166545 larry and the crew would arrange interviews set up the lights and camera warm up the subject with a pre interview once it was all lit and they were ready id come in
7166546 look im not trying to mandate that people think anything in particular im just suggesting theres a different way to think thats just free speech but when it comes to religion free speech has been off limits for many years
7166547 now the bush administration has done all it could to make religion a part of government you cant let that happen you could say that george w bush allowed this movie to be made
7166548 if anything is clear about our beginnings as a country its that the founding fathers wanted to separate religion from government some were christians but most were deists they used generic terms like the creator and they never mention jesus christ in any of their founding documents
7166549 everybody we talked to was reasonable theyre normally functioning people
7166550 but if youre religious it means you believe in some crazy stuff and at that point you dont look reasonable people think we sought out crazy people and ignored this mythical rational religious person
7166551 my point is that if you believe this stuff you are crazy at least in one area of your life
7166552 who told me that the gospels were based on eyewitness accounts and when i argued that the earliest account of jesus life was written down decades after his death collins said well it was 30 or 40 years thats almost eyewitness
7166553 larry wanted us to go to saudi arabia i said larry we cant go because they dont let jews into saudi arabia so he suggested going in disguised as women
7166554 can you imagine what kind of trouble wed be in if they found it was a couple of jewish guys in those beekeeper suits its one thing being thrown out of the vatican which we were but its another to be beheaded
7166555 it may be hard for people to believe but im not anti jesus
7166556 thomas jefferson had this great idea he rewrote the gospels throwing out the miracles and theology and just leaving jesus philosophy
7166557 jesus was one of the great role models and a true revolutionary his idea that the powerless and meek had real dignity that was radical it still is today
7166558 i didnt go overnight from a child to a rational person i was still dealing with this stuff when i was 40 even as an adult when i got in trouble it was god if you get me out of this one ill never mess up again
7166559 now i say that i dont know im not proclaiming anything for sure
7166560 well i take that back what i do know for sure is that people who think they know for sure are full of it

7166569 once the missile defense system is put in place it will work automatically with the entire nuclear capability of the united states it will be an integral part of the us nuclear capability and for the first time in history and i want to emphasize this there will be elements of the us nuclear capability on the european continent it simply changes the whole configuration of international security of course we have to respond to that
7166570 us missiles in europe beyond deterrence to first strike threat
7166571 by means of a us first strike about 99 of russian nuclear forces would be taken out
7166572 some people have the illusion that you can do everything just as you want regardless of the interests of other people of course it is for precisely this reason that the international situation gets worse and eventually results in an arms race but we are not the instigators we do not want it why would we want to divert resources to this and we are not jeopardizing our relations with anyone but we must respond name even one step that we have taken or one action of ours designed to worsen the situation there are none we are not interested in that we are interested in maintaining a good atmosphere
7166573 it would be better to look for other ways to fight terrorism than create low yield nuclear weapons that lower the threshold for using these weapons and thereby put humankind on the brink of nuclear catastrophe
7166574 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

7166589 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why
7166590 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7166591 i can believe they didnt pick hillary put an ankle bracelet on bill and do it she got 18 million votes what are they thinking
7166592 there will be a lot of calls for unity but let us acknowledge what this really is unity is a weapon that the party is going to use against us
7166593 purer than the driven snow never touched those politics in my life
7166594 better make it clear you are not speaking of me
7166595 we cant beat hillary lets invest our money in helping a democrat we can beat steal the nomination from her
7166596 no you marry a rich girl trust me my next wife is going to be rich then i wont have to worry about anything
7166597 oh nate hes just one guy thats not how all of us people think
7166598 i cant stand change why cant things stay the same
7166599 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7166600 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7166601 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7166602 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7166603 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7166604 ive spoken with armed forces commander in chief general luis trigo who has precise instructions to safeguard and defend the bolivian people
7166605 the government will protect the oil pipelines and gas valves
7166606 senates do have a watchdog role australians dont want a rubber stamp senate
7166607 and i think some in the liberal party wish they were saved from workchoices with a senate that could have blocked it
7166608 we got some decisions wrong as the previous government and thats why were out of government
7166609 ive always believed we should have a more robust senate
7166610 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7166611 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7166612 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7166613 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7166614 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7166615 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7166616 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7166617 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas
7166618 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7166619 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and good man
7166620 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes obama made a very wise selection
7166621 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties countries
7166622 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done
7166623 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7166624 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7166625 im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7166626 i was an irish catholic kid with a father like many of yours in tough economic times and fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe my dad repeated it its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7166627 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7166628 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7166629 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7166630 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7166631 in all my years in the senate i have never in my life seen washington so broken
7166632 ladies and gentlemen that is what he said you cant change america when you support george bushs policies 95 per cent of the time
7166633 he brings experience he brings maturity hes his own man who can tell you youre wrong with a smile on his face
7166634 i like the combination of youth and experience hes a senior just like me
7166635 has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7166636 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7166637 many things in life are a moment of pleasure and a lifetime of embarrassment

7166660 ha hes not far removed from mccain on foreign policy
7166661 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7166662 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7166663 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7166664 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7166665 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7166666 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7166667 i stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead
7166668 my medal count goal is that at the end of the day when 91 000 people leave that stadium theyve heard our national anthem so many times that theyre humming it when they walk out the door
7166669 we came out with a new attitude tonight men and women
7166670 its just special its a group effort and its totally different from an individual thing its a blessing to end on this note
7166671 its hard after working for four years and coming up short i dont think that memory will go away overnight i think about it a lot but at least now i have something positive to think about as well
7166672 we had a meeting this afternoon we didnt talk about what people thought we talked about things that were going on in america we talked about people sitting around their tv watching we wanted to give them a shot of something so they would really get up in the morning and keep it going
7166673 i think they understood the importance of the moment to represent
7166674 we had confidence in sanya that she would be able to bring it home strong
7166675 when i saw the russian team ahead of us i was like finally i have a chance to chase and really have fun it really pumped me up to have a little challenge was exciting
7166676 shes one of the best competitors and i guess she was kind of mad at the bronze medal so she was ready to go
7166677 its an incredible team probably the strongest team that weve ever sent to the olympics
7166678 i am not proud that we werent in the finals i have lived my entire life to be in that race we werent there i cant change that but it shouldnt have a reflection on how this mens team performed
7166679 somebody somewhere has got a voodoo doll of the u s
7166680 these are professional athletes who are the best in their field and anybody who ever ran a high school relay cringes when that baton hits the track
7166681 it reminds me of nba players who have horrendous free throw percentages all it takes is repetition preparation and focus to make a free throw the same goes for baton passing
7166682 i really feel im the best 400 meter runner in the world
7166683 over the past few months ive been dropping time and now im right at the top five so i put myself into world contention for the next few years and this will be good for london
7166684 hell be the new face of breaststroke for the u s
7166685 i dont think people realize what it is to not make a team and then to try to make the next team the real willpower that it takes to hang onto that dream
7166686 i think you have to ask a lot of questions how important is it what kind of financial support are you going to have an olympic medal yeah its going to help you get ahead in life but its not going to secure the rest of your life
7166687 it still hasnt sunk in this is one of the best things that has ever happened to me im truly grateful to the orioles and the maryland lottery for this
7166688 well im trying to figure out what this thing is
7166689 well yes of course mommy but what is it really
7166690 i mean it looks like something i know its a spider web
7166691 watch me mommy wheee im the famous big spider and this is my home wheee wheee
7166692 glad to meet you mr big spider what are you doing on this fine day
7166693 ive never understood how you can do that and still come up with a clean room
7166694 it does something to my head and i get stuck staring at a mess if its laying on the floor
7166695 i dont really want to see much thats out and im just not in the mood for that nicole kidman movie tonight
7166696 go find someone else to watch that one with wes
7166697 so not in the mood for rock opera how about oh hell i dont know
7166698 i dont know what to say i thought you should know i didnt want you to find out months later in some horribly awkward way
7166699 im just trying to like picture this in my head you and gunn youre like an item let me guess youre not making a big thing about it or anything right
7166700 well yeah considering that youre both pretty straight from everything i knew
7166701 first of all if we have to use labels i was always sort of bisexual
7166702 but yes youre not wrong about him being pretty straight as you so tactfully put it
7166703 we went out to play pool and have a couple of pints when he rather
7166704 after all this is a strange enough situation for us let alone our friends
7166705 i had planned to be a little less blunt telling you
7166706 you guys are all buddy buddy and fighting hip to shoulder and all that
7166707 i just like them i found st theresa one day when i was in this religious supplies store buying holy water and stuff there was this whole wall of candles staring at me i thought they were really cheap and sad and tacky but i just kept looking at them there were so many of them and they were all staring at me from the same glass cylinder
7166708 and when i asked the lady at the counter she said that st theresa was the little flower i liked that i kinda felt for her so i brought her home
7166709 apparently there are many many parts of you i dont know anything about either
7166710 i dont think we should go to the movies tonight
7166711 ill order us something to eat how does chinese sound
7166712 angel is going to be so confused when you tell him unless he can smell the love on you
7166713 you know im starting to hope there are saints you know or something out there that can hear us calling for help against all the beasts and demons you know
7166714 okay a long time ago long before the world you know was a speck in
7166715 its your fault the guns are out i just wanted to talk
7166716 talk all you want ive got the gun and its not going anywhere
7166717 perhaps we could all sit down and aim guns at each other its a lot more civilized and we are your guests after all
7166718 that makes about as much sense as anything so lets sit down
7166719 youre both behaving childishly and i should call the police
7166720 i think its time we all had a nice long conversation dont you a grown up adult conversation where we resolve this entire tragic saga and get over our bad ass gun toting selves
7166721 you are a big smart ass mr krycek but i suppose that in the interests of diplomacy i can put away my gun if you can put away yours shall we
7166722 if all were going to do is exchange insults ill give you ten minutes before i call the cops on you for breaking and entering and you can get the hell out of my life and take him with you
7166723 you know you want me to leave him here so that you can give him the chewing out of his life and then have extraordinary make up sex while i go and rot in hell tell me that its not in your head
7166724 do you know how much i hate you when i wake up in the morning
7166725 youre sorry youre terribly terribly sorry arent you youre sorry i got abducted because of you youre sorry i lost my sister because of you youre sorry about the cancer youre sorry about the fact that the only child i had was a freak of nature and now im sure youre sorry you left me to be with krycek because you were having a midlife crisis or an ethical moment or whatever it was well sorry sorry sorry i dont want to hear it anymore what good is your sorry
7166726 it means that youre going to have to accept what youve done to me twenty five years ago your sister was kidnapped im going to tell you the secret no one else would it wasnt your fault nothing you could have said or done would have saved samantha
7166727 and its so different with you i could have stopped duane barry i could have stopped the government from taking you i could have stopped cardinale am i god do i really have so much power over you
7166728 what do you think do you think i was really so spineless i couldnt
7166729 youre a disease of the soul and this is what youve left me
7166730 lets go i know im not wanted and you seem to be persona non grata as well
7166731 scully please let me make it up to you please
7166732 when i made you leave i thought maybe that would work you know i thought i had a little of myself free from you but you still haunt my dreams i thought i didnt love you enough but the truth is i loved you too much mulder so much that its killing me
7166733 what could you do for me really you could try to crucify the bastards but you always tried and youve never quite done anything you could swear to treat me right and be the perfect man but that would be like asking for your castration you could tell me youre sorry until the heavens went crashing into the sea but in the morning i would still wake up and nothing would be better
7166734 what on earth were you thinking do you really want to waste every last bit of your life on him
7166735 call her mother make some tea if you can you want to do something for scully and for me do something useful and pretend that youre not upset or astounded
7166736 get your arrogant ass in gear you love her dont you you love me dont you well show love to someone other than yourself for once
7166737 i know but at least youre not in denial anymore can you sit up
7166738 scully theres a few things i know about life one is that happily ever after does not exist
7166739 well i think that weve reached an ending so why not a new beginning
7166740 i know what you want same as me and youre not gonna get it either
7166741 you like the pain the ugliness when you close your eyes you add a pair of fangs to any mouth next to yours
7166742 get over it whatevers curled inside your brain keeping you here forget about it
7166743 someone who doesnt play games when the end of the world is on the line
7166744 go find yourself somewhere hes not he doesnt need you
7166745 i said im hungry im bored too cant we go outside
7166746 cordy i brought you lunch and we cant go outside now its day
7166747 you keep it dark in here all the time and all the clocks are broken what time is it anyway
7166748 and you know i keep it dark in here because youre sick dont you want to get better
7166749 no discussion cordelia has agreed that she needs a cat scan and well tell them what we have to if we have to force them to believe in demons and visions we will this has to stop
7166750 why dont we ever go outside id feel a lot better if i could go outside more
7166751 is it a wednesday or a friday is it summer i dont even know what year it is
7166752 today is sunday i think its the 11th or something today
7166753 i swear it should be much much earlier maybe december the last i remember it was december dont you think it should be
7166754 actually i think its a very april time to be
7166755 are you putting something in the blood im always sleepy why dont we ever go outside i want to go to the movies i want to do something isnt there a new gwyneth paltrow movie out or something
7166756 all the movies out right now suck unless you want to see the olson twins take on chris rock
7166757 im really bored cant we go somewhere we dont have to go to the movies we could go to the pier or maybe we could get crazy and go dancing angel im so bored
7166758 angel i asked you why youre in my bedroom when im trying to take a nap
7166759 we wont know until tomorrow what exactly they will have to do if they have to do anything we are just going to have to wait and see the doctors told me there was no ligament damage
7166760 we were down there in the tight green zone and didnt come away with any points at all anytime you do that you are pretty much going to regret that toward the end of the game our defense when you come off the first half and it is nothing to nothing somebody is doing something decent we didnt protect the quarterback very well tonight on the whole and we have to look at that obviously that is a huge problem for us i wasnt very pleased offensively
7166761 regarding the depiction of nob hill and the nhba as some nefarious organization out to squeeze the last cent out of albuquerque and to completely disrupt the tranquility of life in the neighborhood i would invite you to come and actually speak to some of us
7166762 hey were not as horrible as some of you think
7166763 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7166764 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7166765 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7166766 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7166767 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off even william hartnell the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines
7166768 regarding the depiction of nob hill and the nhba as some nefarious organization out to squeeze the last cent out of albuquerque and to completely disrupt the tranquility of life in the neighborhood i would invite you to come and actually speak to some of us
7166769 hey were not as horrible as some of you think
7166770 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7166771 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7166772 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7166773 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7166774 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7166775 into the telephone promotion code request box youll then receive a total of 20 discount
7166776 of course you do all sonny boys love their moms thats what theyre supposed to do
7166777 4055529 and receive 10 off your first bill or 15 off if you take out madasafish broadband and talk packages
7166778 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7166779 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7166780 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7166781 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7166782 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7166783 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7166784 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7166785 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7166786 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7166787 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7166788 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7166789 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7166790 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7166791 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7166792 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7166793 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7166794 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7166795 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7166796 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7166797 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7166798 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7166799 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7166800 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7166801 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7166802 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7166803 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7166804 do the rights of religious freedom and free speech as guaranteed in both the federal and the california constitutions exempt a medical clinics physicians from complying with the california unruh civil rights acts prohibition against discrimination based on a persons sexual orientation our answer is no
7166805 all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal and no matter what their sex race color religion ancestry national origin disability or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations advantages facilities privileges or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever
7166806 it really is as if california has banned its citizens from having moral consciences
7166807 you must merely obey what the state says you have no right to follow your own moral guide
7166808 these were doctors who did not feel right morally about performing the procedure they actually treated the lady in many aspects but at a certain point said no we cant participate in this for moral reasons because the person is not married and referred her to another doctor who would have provided the treatment but just couldnt do it immediately
7166809 imagine somebody who runs a store for maternity clothing who refuses to serve single women or gay women because the owner believes that it is immoral for such a woman to have had sex let alone to have a child
7166810 up until the 1960s the courts general view was that the free exercise of religion clause in the u s constitution does not give anybody the right to exemption
7166811 discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
7166812 the kind of fighter who i want by my side
7166813 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7166814 attorney general michael mukasey has agreed to allow congressional hearings but not to delay the implementation of new fbi regulations that would allow them to spy on american citizens who are not suspected of any crime
7166815 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7166816 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7166823 come on honey get your drink and sit down its time for that show to come on
7166824 re secret life of the american teenager possible spoilers i watch it i like it i however so far liked 7th heaven better i really loved that show
7166825 re secret life of the american teenager possible spoilers yeah its from the creators of 7th heaven i dont think that the dialogue is
7166826 re re secret life of the american teenager possible spoilers maybe i was a little harsh on the dialogue its not that bad some of it just
7166827 re secret life of the american teenager possible spoilers i like it but missed last week because i forgot about it the only thing im having
7166828 may your troubles be less may your blessings be more may nothing but happiness come through your door
7166829 i am defined by me relation to you if i honor you i honor god if i dishonor god i dishonor you
7166830 after the holocaust of any other profession writers committed suicide at a higher rate than any other profession why because writers need words to make sense of their life and survivors of the holocaust shared one conviction in common we had no words for the abandonment wed experienced

7166838 the government will protect the oil pipelines and gas valves
7166839 choose twelve men from among the people one from each tribe 3 and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight
7166840 go over before the ark of the lord your god into the middle of the jordan each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the israelites 6 to serve as a sign among you in the future when your children ask you what do these stones mean 7 tell them that the flow of the jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it crossed the jordan the waters of the jordan were cut off these stones are to be a memorial to the people of israel forever
7166841 command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony to come up out of the jordan
7166842 in the future when your descendants ask their fathers what do these stones mean
7166843 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7166844 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7166845 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7166846 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7166847 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7166848 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7166849 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7166850 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7166851 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7166852 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7166853 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7166854 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7166855 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas

7166863 this convention is probably more important than any recent convention in terms of introducing the nominee to the american people
7166864 in the past the nominees have been fairly well known or of the type thats not so rare as barack obama
7166865 get people to visualize barack obama as president its something that particularly older americans are having a real problem grappling with
7166866 by giving the clintons speaking roles obama is trying to bring in whatever constituency they have
7166867 and it needs to be united with clinton supporters on board
7166868 the burden is going to reside squarely on barack obama and michelle obama
7166869 all the other pageantry is essentially endorsements by people who want to get him elected

7166874 every generation there are changes in peoples relationship with government
7166875 government should do more especially when youre spending tens of billions of dollars in iraq protecting the interests of millionaires
7166876 weve got to revoke the tax cuts for the wealthy
7166877 we definitely need to do something more for the economically disadvantaged weve allowed big corporations to take millions for corporate leaders while workers get nothing
7166878 during the era when bill clinton was president there was a clear re centering of the party
7166879 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7166880 enormous dissatisfaction with the republican party has brought out the base more
7166881 the rise of the internet and bloggers have made the party more progressive
7166882 by 1980 the average person said i dont need government anymore
7166883 the whole world changes and people feel a little bit at sea and they need help
7166884 well thats because you are uniquely you debee you are just fighting it embrace that part the strokes and the way you lay paint out those are your finger prints left for others to admire and appreciate you you cannot be replicated there will and has not ever been another picasso another chagall another gustav klimt or even michelangelo because they stayed true to themselves therefore there will never be another you because you are a real artist like them remember your hands and your heart cannot be at fault for creating in your style you are purposed for this you are uniquely talented marked divinely inspired and given the privilege of creating so do it now you might see things and ideas you like but ask yourself is that me and if not dont do it but you know that you know not to compare yourself keep trying to find you your voice with your style no more looking around or fighting the way you create embrace you i love that about you you can fly i believe you can
7166885 i think the challenge here is changing the culture and putting together a situation with rick to get this place competitive
7166886 it was getting long so i finally made a comment if anybody is still listening to this tape call me and ill send you 100
7166887 one guy called the center who was a 4 0 student and married the cheerleader
7166888 it taught me a very valuable lesson that kids are kids you cant do too much and you cant expect too much
7166889 hes the type of guy who really tailors what hes doing to his personnel
7166890 everything they teach you in law school can be taught when youre six years old
7166891 the gap between the traditional catholic world view and sciences view of the evolving universe
7166892 there are inputs that they separatist leaders could be targeted so as a precautionary measure curfew has been imposed and people have been asked to maintain peace and calm
7166893 primer encuentro regional para la protecci n de los derechos de ni as ni os y adolescentes en viajes y turismo
7166894 an undeniable inculpatory admission of the harvesting of falun gong practitioner prisoners for profit
7166895 caller what you used before were they from detention centers or prisons
7166896 c oh prisons and it was from healthy falun gong practitioners the healthy falun gong right
7166897 lg right right right we would choose the good ones because we will assure the quality of our operations
7166898 i told her the caller i was not involved in the surgical operations and had no idea where the organs come from i told her i could not answer her questions she then asked me whether these organs come from prisons i replied no to her in clear cut terms
7166899 so here we have on our recording an admission from a doctor that he and his colleagues used to go to a prison to select falun gong practitioners for their organs he does not just say that someone else did this he says that he and his colleagues used to do this themselves moreover we have a further admission that the voice we have on our recording is the voice of the very person our recording says he is
7166900 it has the sanction of the government of china the admission is accordingly one which is sanctioned and approved by the government of china and can not credibly be denied by the government
7166901 myself get it together just finish the sign like you were asked it doesnt matter if it isnt perfect just finish the thing for petes sake
7166902 approving payment to giordano of 900 000 would in essence give he and his children back the money he stole from hud
7166903 giordanos asserted administrative claim comes across as an insiders grab for the 900 000 closing payment to the detriment of actual creditors of the estate and in particular the united states
7166904 shall not be reduced by any administrative fees and expenses
7166905 the irs intends to levy on adler pollock amp sheehan immediately after the disbursement of funds at closing and subsequently as necessary to collect the entire 300 000 payable to
7166906 the governments concern was in preserving the right to pursue unpaid taxes and also preventing parties from unduly benefiting
7166907 the government wants to keep all of its legitimate options open to make the taxpayers whole the options include giordano or other parties to which giordanos money may have gone which is not to say what the ultimate outcome will be
7166908 certainly keeping it open and operating efficiently is a worthwhile objective for all parties
7166909 it means it saves a local senior care facility in woonsocket which is obviously a community that has experienced economic challenges
7166910 it avoids closure of the facility and avoids disrupting 150 residents
7166911 the importance of that is its not being paid from state proceeds
7166912 its being paid from one private party to the others counsel to extinguish a potential lawsuit and it remains subject to any claims of the irs
7166913 the intent always was to try to settle mr giordanos alleged irs obligation not to take cash out of the project
7166914 the intent was to persuade the irs theyd be better off taking the 900 000 as an offer in compromise on his entire irs obligation
7166915 if we got the money at least thats something to pay the irs if we didnt get it then that would provoke the irs to pay attention
7166916 show our respect and support for her without it being divisive
7166917 it will be part of the healing process the coming together the showing of respect for a worthy opponent and coming together at the end of the day
7166918 ill want to see what hillarys take is on it and i havent really thought that through
7166919 im glad that theyre doing this i think its important hillarys candidacy was historic she ran for president of the united states not just as a woman she ran as the best qualified candidate that was her pitch and everybody pretty much conceded that that was a legitimate pitch for her to make and for us to be at a stage where a woman can do that where she can get 18 million votes that was a very very exciting accomplishment and i think she capped it with one of the great speeches that have been given in american politics
7166920 to get together and cheer and hoot and holler for her and recognize that extraordinary achievement and get themselves in a place where everybody can now move on and support our candidate and make sure that senator obama is elected our next president
7166921 she may even call on people to say you know feel free to cast your votes for senator obama wed like to move on
7166922 it is interesting to see how things have come full circle
7166923 this is not just a neighborhood project ive received calls from all over the state
7166924 we want to set up a statewide system so that the folks in newport and the folks in wickford and the folks in the blackstone valley dont have to go through what youre going through
7166925 it has to do with the layout of the neighborhood the proximity of one building to another
7166926 people are totally dissatisfied and felt that national grid was evasive
7166927 that was plenty of fuel to get us all the way to california right down to the water
7166928 we did this to demonstrate that biodiesel is a viable fuel thats easy to use and it works and its reliable
7166929 if we can drive across the country and back with no problems you can put it in your car and drive to work no problem 10 miles
7166930 pretty much anybody with a diesel engine can use it
7166931 there were probably about 50 in coolest things we saw
7166932 you put your hands outside of the truck and its hotter than it is inside the truck and that was about 100 inside the truck maybe 110
7166933 you had the ocean then you also had big pastures filled with cattle grazing with horses but then you also had the mountains behind you
7166934 often i ask people what kind of help do you need they answer everything
7166935 those numbers are unheard of there are people living in campgrounds theyre doubled up or theyre living in the woods its scary
7166936 do you see this this is what men do to you
7166937 it was 4 a m she kicked me and said your mothers dead she made me go to school the next day
7166938 i was ready to drive my car into a lake they gave me hope
7166939 when im working i feel in control when im not i feel trapped
7166940 im really poor right now im a single mom with two boys
7166941 every day i wonder how am i going to make ends meet
7166942 only gives you what you can handle hes pushed me out of my comfort zone
7166943 but running away isnt the way to deal with it
7166944 to this point however no satisfactory answers have been found
7166945 theyre one of the reasons my car hasnt been taken
7166946 how much has he eaten in the last 34 hours
7166947 hes drinking 18 to 20 ounces of formula a day
7166948 why do you have to scare mommy all the time
7166949 we may ask you to write guidebooks on how to make children with heart diseases grow
7166950 hey who the f are you what position do you play
7166951 coach im not going to give you my pen but if you run out here you can definitely borrow it
7166952 hey kevin ive really been loving stalking your facebook profile i never knew brian de la puente had a sister
7166953 the issue of apologising does not arise as we have enough evidence to charge them we are proud of what we have achieved and are grateful to the media for their cooperation in eradicating corruption
7166954 to send the message that there is a strong alternative agenda to that of the government
7166955 anwar is the glue that binds the opposition alliance together
7166956 hes the only one who can bring these disparate groups together in protest and thats why his opponents are ready to knock him down at any cost
7166957 if this down trend of oil prices continue we want to be able to make sure we can ease the burden of the rakyat by lowering fuel prices
7166958 rest assured however petrol prices would never exceed rm2 70 a litre if global oil prices increase again
7166959 im sorry i cant name all 18 of them right now but i probably could if i tried
7166960 in fact our stated goal for london site of the 2012 games is top 12 and were almost there already
7166961 would you call it an emergency because we didnt have any medals at the time
7166962 i think many canadians thought it was an emergency and maybe some of the inexperienced media might have
7166963 but anybody who has been around the summer games knows that by the end of the first week were only likely to have one or two medals
7166964 its not a reflection of us picking it up in any way
7166965 we just started doing sports that we are really good at
7166966 we dont have any control over the two week schedule
7166967 we should take pride in the accomplishments of our young athletes
7166968 i think they demonstrated that with the proper resources and support we can compete with anybody in the world
7166969 at the end of the day the average canadian will judge our success on the medal count
7166970 we may have to sit down with our partners and reassess whether we want to go for the top 10
7166971 as you drive yourself forward you always have to be reassessing your goals and what youre capable of doing
7166972 were a g 8 nation theres no reason why we shouldnt be looking at the top 8 of the world
7166973 give us the tools and i think well get there
7166974 me he informado y he leido todo lo que he pillado por lo que se ve se demanda bastante trabajo en especial del sector sevicios hay muchisimo turismo y poco personal

7166990 you should definitely mention hevia a spanish bagpiper who has made five albums
7166991 ive only heard the first two albums but the music is very suikoden ish and although it concentrates mostly on bagpipe there are other instruments as well
7166992 so you want to get a vegatarian burrito are you hungry yet
7166993 you know beatriz i feel very comfortable around her i feel like im doing this right its not like im head over heals but i am quite smitten
7166994 smitten english for taken with struck by in love smitten
7166995 i feel like i know how to do this like ive rehearsed this hold on it feels like i know exactly what to do but then it hits me
7166996 i feel like ive focused so much on the beginning that i really dont know what to think about whats next my focus has been on being the most emotionally healthy and balanced person i can be in hopes of attracting the same in someone else and now that i have and it feels good and right i realize that i dont have all the answers but you know whats different this time
7166997 im not worried about it i know it will come to me i have all the tools i dont need all the answers
7166998 you know heather i think youre right about this one
7166999 yeah me too im not afraid at all and im only slightly losing my mind while shes out of town you know im always so glad i can talk to you about these things you know me better than anyone
7167000 i love you beatriz and i will always think you are incredibly wonderful and sexy
7167001 heather promise youll never stop loving me promise well be friends forever
7167002 beatriz we have been friends longer than we were lovers we wouldnt still be this close if we didnt still love each other and i dont see that ill stop feeling this way anytime soon sometimes we drive each other crazy
7167003 and we have to take a break sometimes but we always come back to being friends
7167004 so no im not going to stop loving you the way i feel about her is very different seperate and apart from what i feel for you neither one of you is a threat to the other and besides youre not competing for the same piece of my heart anyway
7167005 youre right i dont know why i get so worried about that sometimes
7167006 its okay sweetheart i understand now lets go eat i fly you buy
7167007 so would you like to give birth in the hospital maternity ward or at home
7167008 the safest setting for labor delivery and the immediate postpartum period is in the hospital
7167009 choosing to deliver a baby at home is to place the process of giving birth over the goal of having a healthy baby
7167010 there is no evidence to support the common assertion that home birth is a less safe option for women experiencing uncomplicated pregnancies
7167011 there is no reason why home birth should not be offered to women at low risk of complications and it may confer considerable benefits for them and their families
7167012 im more of my moms religion and my dad sometimes talks bad about my mom
7167013 he called it a cult and its definitely not a cult it kind of makes me mad sometimes maybe he thinks her religion may be bad for me but i think mainly he doesnt like my mom and is using that as an excuse
7167014 let not your hearts be troubled believe in god a believe also in me 2in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so would i have told you that i go to prepare a place for you 3and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and will take you to myself that where i am you may be also 4and you know the way to where i am going
7167015 lord we do not know where you are going how can we know the way
7167016 i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me 7 if you had known me you would hav known my father also from now on you do know him and have seen him
7167017 lord show us the father and it is enough for us
7167018 have i been with you so long and you still do not know me philip
7167019 what does or could grace in this look like for you tell me about it and i will weep when you weep and rejoice when you rejoice
7167020 you may spoil the gospel by disproportion you have only to attach an exaggerated importance to the secondary things of christianity and a diminished importance to the first things and the mischief is done

7167022 cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance in the united states to warrant appropriate remedial action
7167023 caution cigarette smoking is dangerous to health it may cause death from cancer and other diseases
7167024 a shocking piece of special interest legislation a bill to protect the economic health of the tobacco industry by freeing it of proper regulation
7167025 the quiet victory of the cigarette lobby how it found the best filter yet congress
7167026 you can play with this all you want the results are statistically significant
7167027 my gut feeling forgive this personal comment i do not want my grandson to get a thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on
7167028 we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits this will be a resource to our very busy plaintiff attorneys in this country
7167029 given the sensitivity of the information we have been able to keep it out of the hands of lets say less responsible hands
7167030 perhaps this study should not have been done at all
7167031 will be taken by others and will be used in other ways beyond the control of this group
7167032 the lawsuits are of such magnitude that they could put vaccine producers out of business and limit our capacity to deal with a biological attack by terrorists
7167033 all reputable studies prove theres no link between vaccines and autism
7167034 autism rates have not gone down since all thimerosal was removed from all vaccines in 2001
7167035 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
7167036 childrens play their inborn disposition for curiosity imagination and fantasy is being silenced in the high tech commercialized world we have created toys about which children once spun elaborate personal fables now engender little more than habits of passive consumerism the spontaneous pickup games that once filled neighborhoods have largely been replaced by organized team sports and computer games television sitcoms and movie cds have all but eliminated the self initiated dramatic play that once mimicked and mocked the adult world parents anxious for their children to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy regard play as a luxury that the contemporary child cannot afford over the past two decades children have lost 12 hours of free time a week including eight hours of unstructured play and outdoor activities the disappearance of play from the lives of our children is mirrored in the media television programs rarely depict children as simply playing and having a good time even the cartoons have changed fred flintstone and george jetson never let work get in the way of having fun bob the builder and spongebob squarepants on the other hand love their jobs spongebob was even named employee of the month at the fast food restaurant where he works when did life for a child get to be so hard
7167037 toys once served to socialize children into social roles vocations and academic tool skills today they are more likely to encourage brand loyalties fashion consciousness and group think
7167038 children can play safely without adult organization they have done so as long as people have been on earth
7167039 to ask the question why does god allow has to go back to the issue of what is god allowing the glib answer to the question is god is allowing evil deeds but in fact god is allowing us to prove that we are what he has said we are
7167040 even if you think you dont have any lingering issues i invite you to discover how divorce has changed your life you did not experience the fullness of what god designed for you in a family and so you have been hurt its just that you are part of a generation that has learned to see these scars as normal
7167041 now observe that when that clever harlot our natural reason
7167042 alas must i rock the baby wash its diapers make its bed smell its stench stay up nights with it take care of it when it cries heal its rashes and sores
7167043 well i guess we should go take a look at how our garden is doing today
7167044 your dad abby in the car i have to get to the hospital
7167045 abigail honey im not so sure you should go with me right now i really dont know what is going to happen there the police officer said it was a bad accident and i need to be there for your dad
7167046 as soon as i know hes okay i will come get you i promise abby
7167047 okay mom you go help dad ill help aunt diane with stephen
7167048 thank you abby you are being very grown up right now
7167049 you know i heard that music is therapy for the soul
7167050 this is for my father who made my life so full filling it with love and sunshine never thinking it would dull you left and i never thought i would feel that warmth again but love has come back in our lifes and we are on the mend the seeds have sprouted in their tray and the little plants are strong just like the seeds of love in my heart that waited for so long i still miss you very much no matter what the weather and think about the times ahead when we can be together

7167060 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7167061 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7167062 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7167063 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7167064 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7167065 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7167066 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7167067 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7167068 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7167069 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7167070 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7167071 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7167072 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7167073 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7167074 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7167075 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7167076 if tata motors approach us we will certainly see to it
7167077 a year and a half ago i had requested him to locate nano plant in andhra i do not know why he went to west bengal i will write to him again
7167078 doublequotes to singlequote in that page and include the php script you want looks like you dont very much about php so your question is a bit confusing
7167079 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7167080 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7167081 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7167082 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7167083 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7167084 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7167085 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7167086 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7167087 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7167088 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7167089 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7167090 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7167091 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7167092 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7167093 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7167094 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7167095 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7167096 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7167097 in the book he outlines how and where he started writing i dont believe there was a time when he did not write he calls it
7167098 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7167099 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7167100 are there ways that we can better cooperate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7167101 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7167102 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7167103 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7167104 in fact there are no predictions by ipcc at all and there never have been the ipcc instead proffers what if projections of future climate that correspond to certain emissions scenarios
7167105 they do not consider many things like the recovery of the ozone layer for instance or observed trends in forcing agents there is no estimate even probabilistically as to the likelihood of any emissions scenario and no best guess
7167106 a 2000 year global temperature reconstruction based on non treering proxies
7167107 burger argues that the 2006 temperature analysis by osborn and briffa did not apply the appropriate statistical tests that link the proxy records to observational data and as such osborn and briffa did not properly quantify the statistical uncertainties in their analyses
7167108 as a result the highly significant occurrences of positive anomalies during the 20th century disappear
7167109 there have been times in earth history when atmospheric co2 concentrations were 5 10 even 15 times the present concentration and the climate of earth still supported animals not unlike ourselves
7167110 only about 5 of that time has been characterized by conditions on earth that were so cold that the poles could support masses of permanent ice
7167111 for most of earths history the globe has been warmer than it has been for the last 200 years it has rarely been cooler
7167112 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7167113 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7167114 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7167115 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7167116 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7167117 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7167118 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7167119 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7167120 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7167121 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7167122 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7167123 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7167124 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7167125 who are open to doing something on the production side
7167126 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7167127 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7167128 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7167129 as fully set forth above the record companies hired mediasentry to break into private computers to spy view files remove information and copy images
7167130 the record companies received and transmitted the information and images to settlement support center
7167131 the record companies have repeated these unlawful and deceptive actions with many other victims throughout the united states
7167132 people take a strategic shot at a rico claim to try to up the timbre of debate
7167133 right off the bat there are some problems with the predicate claims for rico
7167134 you have to have a pattern of racketeering activity either criminal acts where there is a one year jail penalty or mail or wire fraud
7167135 it would likely take someone on the inside testifying that the riaa pursued people that it knew were innocent
7167136 then there would be a serious risk of malicious prosecution but youve got to have them cold
7167137 if you have enough people bringing charges of malicious prosecution you could then show a pattern of practices on the part of the riaa but the testimony from a former riaa or label employee if it exists would be key
7167138 youre damned if you do youre damned if you dont
7167139 love love love poetry from the heart soul amp voice of love
7167140 my medal count goal is that at the end of the day when 91 000 people leave that stadium theyve heard our national anthem so many times that theyre humming it when they walk out the door
7167141 we came out with a new attitude tonight men and women
7167142 its just special its a group effort and its totally different from an individual thing its a blessing to end on this note
7167143 its hard after working for four years and coming up short i dont think that memory will go away overnight i think about it a lot but at least now i have something positive to think about as well
7167144 we had a meeting this afternoon we didnt talk about what people thought we talked about things that were going on in america we talked about people sitting around their tv watching we wanted to give them a shot of something so they would really get up in the morning and keep it going
7167145 i think they understood the importance of the moment to represent
7167146 we had confidence in sanya that she would be able to bring it home strong
7167147 when i saw the russian team ahead of us i was like finally i have a chance to chase and really have fun it really pumped me up to have a little challenge was exciting
7167148 shes one of the best competitors and i guess she was kind of mad at the bronze medal so she was ready to go
7167149 its an incredible team probably the strongest team that weve ever sent to the olympics
7167150 i am not proud that we werent in the finals i have lived my entire life to be in that race we werent there i cant change that but it shouldnt have a reflection on how this mens team performed
7167151 somebody somewhere has got a voodoo doll of the u s
7167152 these are professional athletes who are the best in their field and anybody who ever ran a high school relay cringes when that baton hits the track
7167153 it reminds me of nba players who have horrendous free throw percentages all it takes is repetition preparation and focus to make a free throw the same goes for baton passing
7167154 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7167155 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7167156 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7167157 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7167158 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7167159 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7167160 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7167161 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7167162 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7167163 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7167164 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7167165 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7167166 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7167167 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7167168 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7167169 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7167170 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7167171 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7167172 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7167173 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7167174 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7167175 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7167176 too often we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought
7167177 i would rather die on the hill of integrity than live in the valley of compromise
7167178 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7167179 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7167180 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public
7167181 hoped to show the world a china that after 30 years of rapid development has not been seen in hundreds of years
7167182 cheering for foreign teams would have been unimaginable four years ago much less 20 years ago
7167183 this is the beauty of dictatorship they can do many things that other countries cannot do
7167184 you have to remember they even controlled the weather no other country would do this
7167185 the olympic games are all about sport it is about the olympic spirit it is not a political platform
7167186 people now realize its not such a simple matter its not just like opening the door and inviting guests in
7167187 these are the issues that they want us to deal with you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
7167188 thats what we have been working on over the summer and thats what we intend to do
7167189 i believe people will see a government that is not only on their side but very active on their behalf
7167190 if you have someone who has experience with other operating systems i dont think its all that difficult switching over to linux
7167191 conceptually the commands are the same the structure is similar its just learning what the exact commands are to accomplishing various tasks
7167192 another skill in linux is you have to be willing to ask other people for help
7167193 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7167194 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7167195 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7167196 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7167197 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7167198 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7167199 i worked for wayne root for the football season in 2001
7167200 could he have sold more than a thousand copies nationally
7167201 hes eliminating mistakes changing speeds real well moving the ball in and out and hes fielding his position well
7167202 i could take this as a here we go again but im not going to do that
7167203 im going to continue to work hard and get better and ill be successful it was just a couple of mistakes leaving balls where they shouldnt be trying to be aggressive obviously it didnt work out in my favor
7167204 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority
7167205 joe biden brings a tremendous amount of energy to this ticket
7167206 joe has said probably nicer things about john mccain than he has said about senator obama
7167207 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain i think the country would be better off
7167208 theres no question that they were competitors at that time and so some of them could well be explained that way
7167209 its a bare knuckle sport we all know that were americans
7167210 i think its something everybodys able to look at and understand its just a product of what you get from this immediate advertisement this sort of comes with every announcement
7167211 it does add foreign policy experience to the extent that theyll use joe for advice
7167212 to put someone with his foreign policy and his national security expertise onto the ticket really helps us ensure well really rise to those challenges in an important way
7167213 it does add foreign policy experience to the extent that theyll use joe for advice
7167214 act as if everyone around you is an idiot and you will make it easier on yourself
7167215 ive been looking over here all weekend and i couldnt stand it any longer
7167216 we still live in the country that was built by ivan the terrible
7167217 people like putin they have no other idea of how to rule
7167218 what russia does now it cannot be analyzed with modern political logic it is obsolete if modern countries like the u s declare war they have more or less rational reasons even if they are mistaken
7167219 you shouldnt expect logic from a kgb lieutenant colonel anyway you shouldnt expect modern political thinking
7167220 russia is a big and capable country which will not let the west dictate the conditions
7167221 in any situation russia is going to act as it sees fit
7167222 russia has never been conquered not in 1 000 years though many tried
7167223 its because its in our genes not to allow anyone to dictate the conditions how to act where to act
7167224 theyve realized that if russia merely plays the role the west has made for it we would quickly become a country that protects the pipeline sending gas and oil from western siberia
7167225 it is too early to bury russia as a great power
7167226 what makes the situation even more difficult is that all these small nations which existed between russia and the heart of europe they have rushed to join europe
7167227 no se puede cambiar a modo video por que es 1024x32
7167228 i think hes really the smart choice because he brings a balance to the ticket in terms of experience that i think will attract a lot of voters i met biden during the caucus and i wasnt that excited to meet biden i didnt really know him but i came out of the meeting so engaged
7167229 i was really surprised at what a masterful campaigner he is its a really balanced ticket a perfect ticket now because you have a visionary paired with a masterful policy maker he adds depth and he will help us attract undecided voters people say he undermined the message of change but the thing about joe biden is hes very direct he has a reputation for being honest and i just think people will find the two of them together to be unstoppable
7167230 biden is an excellent choice as he was probably the most qualified of the 17 candidates starting out he brings a depth that will balance a ticket and account for perceived shortcomings of obama
7167231 more capable of making a mistake in the fall campaign than obama is
7167232 picking a consummate insider seems to be going completely against the theme of change
7167233 overall i think its probably one of the best choices obama could have made
7167234 it obviously shows that sen obama believes that he needs to strengthen his foreign policy credentials and i think biden can do that
7167235 if theres a contrast there thats interesting or ironic obama has positioned himself rather effectively so far as the change agent candidate the candidate who will bring change to washington and he picks somebody whos served in the united states senate longer than sen mccain
7167236 in some regard it takes that messaging away from him a little bit i think hillary clinton would have been an effective pick for sen obama to unite the party ultimately this is still a mccain vs obama campaign it almost always comes down to the people at the top of the ticket
7167237 i think its a solid pick i think its very complimentary to what obama brings to table to have someone with foreign and domestic policy experience biden really rounds out the ticket
7167238 i think having that experience and that long view is really critical the fact that he has been a part of all the major foreign policy issues the u
7167239 hes a very engaging person who listens very well hes compatible to what barack obamas all about
7167240 it bodes for a strong effective relationship once elected overall hes a straight talker and when we hear politicians talk about straight talk its refreshing to have someone that can be so frank thats what we need
7167241 ive had people calling me telling me they were going to vote for obama but now theyre actually going to campaign for him this takes all of mccains advantages away if anyone can stand up to mccain its joe biden
7167242 i think it says a lot about obama it shows that obama is willing to surround himself with the best and its not about his ego because joe biden will tell him how it is and what he thinks he wont hold back
7167243 i think in many ways this was a choice driven by vladimir putin the russian prime minister the invasion of georgia and the challenge to nato and the united states by the russians highlighted the need to offset sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience
7167244 so you can add that biden brings 35 years of deep expertise on international issues but the choice was a compromise given that biden is the ultimate washington insider that obama has been campaigning against
7167245 we have every expectation that the president will move forward on protecting these places sometime in the fall
7167246 today we put the champagne on ice and we will pop it open
7167247 these vast pacific areas are nearly three times the size of texas
7167248 countless seabirds dolphins fishes corals and tiny things as yet undiscovered could survive as a result free of the threats that are eliminating them elsewhere

7167251 was concerned with the impact that hunters lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination
7167252 biden told lotito that in light of these concerns his brother had asked him to seek lotitos assistance in finding employment for hunter in a non lobbying capacity
7167253 this lawsuit has nothing to do with joe biden and there is absolutely no truth to those allegations
7167254 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7167255 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7167256 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation the senator was involved in any of these events

7167277 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7167278 relations between iran and russia can best be described as a marriage of convenience
7167279 iranian leaders are aware of it the dependency and they resent it but there was very little they could do about it
7167280 following current developments in the caucasus and urge s the belligerent parties to resolve their disputes through peaceful means
7167281 our reticence only aids the camp that wishes us regional adversaries to remain silent while us supporters come to the support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7167282 a whole new set of options may be opening up for iran
7167283 this war in georgia was an early sign of escalating russian assertiveness
7167284 irans rather neutral stance on the caucasus can be read as a signal to the united states
7167285 if the united states was to open an interest section in iran perhaps neighboring countries such as turkmenistan would see this as the start of a thaw in us iranian relations the real opening they are waiting for in order to boost their trade or oil and gas shipments via iran

7167300 it was kind of demoralizing i wanted to go back home for a while nobody thought the olympics would continue
7167301 i think when it came to competing i think the stress was a little too much the day of the 800 i didnt want to eat breakfast or lunch the coaches stressed to us to force ourselves to eat if we had to and eat as much as we could
7167302 i was talking to one of the athletes before the start of the race and he said he was starving
7167303 it was unfortunate for me but i still think i was lucky if i didnt run in the olympics in 1972 i probably wouldnt have had the chance to come to the united states i would have miss that
7167304 for most african runners their only international experience is the olympics

7167306 i had a good time at enmu the competition was good the school was good and the people were friendly
7167307 i was encouraged by a lot of people but was my priority was my educational career my dad wanted me to run but my mom wanted me to concentrate on school
7167308 i figured it was easier to run than to milk cows

7167310 among the more vocal doubters at the service today was mr
7167311 thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue
7167312 blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies
7167313 thy tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue
7167314 the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies
7167315 for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak
7167316 ye shall be slain all of you they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly
7167317 the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped
7167318 he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight
7167319 for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue
7167320 remove from me the way of lying and grant me thy law graciously
7167321 deliver my soul o lord from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue
7167322 these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren
7167323 for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips
7167324 he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth a slander is a fool
7167325 the lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying tongue is but for a moment
7167326 lying lips are abomination to the lord but they that deal truly are his delight
7167327 a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame
7167328 a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter lies

7167446 but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand horsemen and killed shophach the captain of the host
7167447 and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah
7167448 and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel
7167449 and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel
7167450 so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people seventy thousand men

7167477 you know not what you are saying nor understand the crime you are committing upon yourself give heed for i will relate my story today i walked alone in this solitary valley when i reached this place a group of angels descended to attack and struck me severely had it not been for one of them who carried a blazing sword with two sharp edges i would have driven them off but i had no power against the brilliant sword
7167478 the armed angel i believe he was michael was an expert gladiator had i not thrown myself to the friendly ground and feigned to have been slain he would have torn me into brutal death
7167479 blessed be michaels name who has saved humanity from this vicious enemy
7167480 my disdain for humanity is not greater than your hatred for yourself you are blessing michael who has never come to your rescue you are cursing me in the hour of my defeat even though i was and still am the source of your tranquility and happiness you deny me your blessing and extend not your kindness but you live and prosper in the shadow of my being you have adopted for my existence an excuse and weapon for your career and you employ my name in justification for your deeds has not my past caused you to be in need of my present and future have you reached your goal in amassing the required wealth have you found it impossible to extract more gold and silver from your followers using my kingdom as a threat
7167481 do you not realize that you will starve to death if i were to die what would you do tomorrow if you allow me to die today what vocation would you pursue if my name disappeared for decades you have been roaming these villages and warning people against falling into my hands they have bought your advice with their poor denars and with the products of their land what would they buy from you tomorrow if they discovered that their wicked enemy no longer existed your occupation would die with me for the people would be safe from sin as a clergyman do you not realize that satans existence alone has created his enemy the church that ancient conflict is the secret hand which removes the gold and silver from the faithfuls pocket and deposits it forever into the pouch of the preacher and missionary how can you permit me to die here when you know it will surely cause you to lose your prestige your church your home and your livelihood
7167482 father you are proud but ignorant i will disclose to you the history of belief and in it you will find the truth which binds both of our beings and ties my existence with your very conscience
7167483 in the first hour of the beginning of time man stood before the face of the sun and stretched forth his arms and cried for the first time saying behind the sky there is a great and loving and benevolent god
7167484 and the man walked toward his cave whispering to himself i am between two compelling forces one in whom i must take refuge and the other against whom i must struggle and the ages marched in procession while man existed between two powers one that he blessed because it exalted him and one that he cursed because it frightened him but he never perceived the meaning of a blessing or of a curse he was between the two like a tree between summer when it blooms and winter when it shivers
7167485 when man saw the dawn of civilization which is human understanding the family as a unit came into being then came the tribes whereupon labour was divided according to ability and inclination one clan cultivated the land another built shelters others wove raiment or hunted food subsequently divination made its appearance upon the earth and this was the first career adopted by man which possessed no essential urge or necessity
7167486 there was a man in the first tribe called la wiss i know not the origin of his name he was an intelligent creature but extremely indolent and he detested work in the cultivation of land construction of shelters grazing of cattle or any pursuit requiring body movement or exertion and since food during that era could not be obtained except by arduous toil la wiss slept many nights with an empty stomach
7167487 one summer night as the members of that clan were gathered around the hut of the chief talking of the outcome of their day and waiting for their slumber time a man suddenly leaped to his feet pointed toward the moon and cried out saying look at the night god his face is dark and his beauty vanished and he has turned into a black stone hanging in the dome of the sky the multitude gazed at the moon shouted in awe and shook with fear as if the hands of darkness had clutched their hearts for they saw the night god slowly turning into a dark ball which changed the bright countenance of the earth and caused the hills and valleys before their eyes to disappear behind a black veil
7167488 at that moment la wiss who had seen an eclipse before and understood its simple cause stepped forward to make much of this opportunity
7167489 thus did la wiss continue talking using many cryptic words of his own fabrication which they had never heard
7167490 the multitude rose and gazed at the moon that was shining in full beam their fear became tranquillity and their confusion was now joy they commenced dancing and singing and striking with their thick sticks upon sheets of iron filling the valleys with their clamour and shouting
7167491 that night the chief of the tribe called la wiss and spoke to him saying you have done something no man has ever done you have demonstrated knowledge of a hidden secret that no other among us understands
7167492 and la wiss slyly assured everything the human god reveals to me in my divine dreams will be conveyed to you in awakeness and you may be confident that i will act directly between you and him
7167493 la wiss rose and started to leave but the chief stopped him saying who and what is the one whom you call the human god
7167494 the god of gods became enraged and said i shall preserve for myself the primary power and the great authority and the essential secrets for i am the beginning and the end
7167495 and bahtaar answered him saying unless you share with me your might and power i and my children and my childrens children will revolt against you
7167496 as the chief listened his forehead wrinkled and his face turned pale
7167497 the chief repeated the word satan many times with a quivering voice that sounded like the rustling of dry branches at the passing of the wind then he said why does satan hate man as much as he hates the gods
7167498 and la wiss responded quickly he hates man because man is a descendant of satans brothers and sisters
7167499 the chief leaned his head upon his thick stick and whispered saying i have learned now the inner secret of that strange power who directs the tempest toward our homes and brings the pestilence upon us and our cattle
7167500 and la wiss left the chief of the tribe and went to his retiring place happy over his ingenuity and intoxicated with the wine of his pleasure and fancy for the first time the chief and all of the tribe except la wiss spent the night slumbering in beds surrounded by horrible ghosts fearful spectres and disturbing dreams
7167501 thus divination came to this earth and thus was my existence the cause for its appearance la wiss was the first who adopted my cruelty as a vocation after the death of la wiss this occupation circulated through his children and prospered until it became a perfect and divine profession pursued by those whose minds are ripe with knowledge and whose souls are noble and whose hearts are pure and whose fancy is vast
7167502 in babylon the people bowed seven times in worshipping before a priest who fought me with his chantings in nineveh they looked upon a man who claimed to have known my inner secrets as a golden link between god and man in tibet they called the person who wrestled with me the son of the sun and moon in byblus ephesus and antioch they offered their childrens lives in sacrifice to my opponents in jerusalem and rome they placed their lives in the hands of those who claimed they hated me and fought me with all their might
7167503 in every city under the sun my name was the axis of the educational circle of religion arts and philosophy had it not been for me no temples would have been built no towers or palaces would have been erected i am the courage that creates resolution in man i am the source that provokes originality of thought i am the hand that moves mans hands i am satan everlasting i am satan whom the people fight in order to keep themselves alive if they cease struggling against me slothfulness will deaden their hearts and souls in accordance with the weird penalties of their tremendous myth
7167504 i am the enraged and mute tempest who agitates the minds of man and the hearts of women and in fear of me they will travel to places of worship to condemn me or to places of vice to make me happy by surrendering to my will the monk who prays in the silence of the night to keep me from his bed is like the prostitute who invites me to her chamber i am satan everlasting and eternal
7167505 i am the builder of convents and monasteries upon the foundation of fear i build wine shops and wicked houses upon the foundations of lust and self gratification if i cease to exist fear and enjoyment will be abolished from the world and through their disappearance desires and hopes will cease to exist in the human heart life will become empty and cold like a harp with broken strings i am satan everlasting
7167506 i am the inspiration for falsehood slander treachery deceit and mockery and if these elements were to be removed from this world human society would become like a deserted field in which naught would thrive but thorns of virtue i am satan everlasting
7167507 i am the father and mother of sin and if sin were to vanish the fighters of sin would vanish with it along with their families and structures
7167508 i am the heart of all evil would you wish for human motion to stop through cessation of my heartbeats would you accept the result after destroying the cause i am the cause would you allow me to die in this deserted wilderness do you desire to sever the bond that exists between you and me answer me clergyman
7167509 and satan stretched his arms and bent his head forward and gasped deeply his face turned to gray and he resembled one of those egyptian statues laid waste by the ages at the side of the nile
7167510 i know now what i had not known an hour ago forgive my ignorance i know that your existence in this world creates temptation and temptation is a measurement by which god adjudges the value of human souls this is the scale that almighty god uses to weigh the spirits i am certain that if you die temptation will die and with its passing death will destroy the ideal power which elevates and alerts man
7167511 you must live for if you die and the people know it their fear of hell will vanish and they will cease worshipping for naught would be sin you must live for in your life is the salvation of humanity from vice and sin
7167512 as to myself i shall sacrifice my hatred for you on the altar of my love for man
7167513 what an intelligent person you are father and what wonderful knowledge you possess in theological facts you have found through the power of your knowledge a purpose for my existence which i had never understood and now we realize the need for each other
7167514 come close to me my brother darkness is submerging the plains and half of my blood has escaped upon the sand of this valley and naught remains of me but the remnants of a broken body which death shall soon buy unless you render aid
7167515 one died crucified another died mad and the third is not yet born
7167516 we can no longer keep our heads buried in the sand pretending there is no problem
7167517 there is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza the producers of these vaccines know that they are worthless but they go on selling them anyway
7167518 four of the medical experts advising the uk government on whether the new meningitis c vaccine is safe have links to one or more of the drug companies producing it the revelations following last weeks report of a cover up of suspected adverse reactions to the drug have prompted concerns among parents and members of parliament about conflicts of interest within the medical profession
7167519 there are significant risks associated with every immunisation and numerous contra indications that may make it dangerous for the shots to be given to your child there is growing suspicion that immunisation against relatively harmless childhood diseases may be responsible for the dramatic increase in auto immune diseases since mass inoculations were introduced
7167520 public policy regarding vaccines is fundamentally flawed it is permeated by conflicts of interest it is based on poor scientific methodology including studies that are too small too short and too limited in populations represented which is moreover insulated from independent criticism
7167521 there is a great deal of evidence to prove that immunisation of children does more harm than good
7167522 if you want the truth on vaccination you must go to those who are not making anything out of it if doctors shot at the moon every time it was full as a preventive of measles and got a shilling for it they would bring statistics to prove that moon shooting was a most efficient practice and that the population would be decimated if it were stopped
7167523 i am the father of a 9 year old son whose descent into the world of autism began at the age of 7 months old after receiving numerous vaccinations in a single day the same story that is told by thousands of other parents of children throughout the country whose healthy normally developing children have become autistic after vaccinations
7167524 i am just one parent among many who has a vaccine damaged child it was only when my son lost his ability to speak and communicate after his final vaccination at 24 months and autistic behaviours began to emerge that i started to do my own research i discovered that what we have been led to believe is a myth namely that vaccines are safe and effective
7167525 this time i saw it connor at 11 months smiling for the camera looking into his daddys eyes touching his mommys hair connor on his first birthday after his morning visit to the doctors office and mmr vaccination no longer looking at anyone no longer smiling and perhaps the most revealing picture connor walking on his toes one of the most common behaviours in autism within a day he had changed to the question how many of you here believe your children have been damaged by vaccines seventy five percent of the attendees stood up and raised their hands one woman a few rows behind me was crying and i knew intuitively that her faith in the medical establishment had finally crumbled
7167526 i have thought many times of all of the insane things we have advocated in medicine that is one of the most insane to insist on the vaccination of children or anybody else for the prevention of smallpox when as a matter of fact we are never able to prove that vaccination saved one man from smallpox
7167527 vaccination is a monstrosity a misbegotten offspring of error and ignorance it should have no place in either hygiene or medicine believe not in vaccination it is a world wide delusion an unscientific practice a fatal superstition with consequences measured today by tears and sorrow without end
7167528 immunization against smallpox is more hazardous than the disease itself
7167529 it is now accepted that the risks of routine smallpox vaccination outweigh those of natural infection in britain
7167530 i have been saying for some years that the use of live vaccines such as that used from smallpox can activate a dormant infection such as that from aids hiv
7167531 when the link between unsafe mercury laden vaccine and autism adha asthma allergies and diabetes becomes undeniable mainstream medicine will be sporting a huge self inflicted and well deserved black eye then will come the billion dollar awards by enraged juries to the children and their families i cant wait
7167532 after a careful consideration of the history of vaccination gleaned from an impartial and comprehensive study of vital statistics and pertinent data from every reliable source and after an experience derived from having vaccinated 31 000 subjects i am firmly convinced that vaccination cannot be shown to have any logical relation to the diminution of cases of smallpox vaccination does not protect it actually renders its subjects more susceptible by depressing the vital power and diminishing the natural resistance and millions of people have died of smallpox which they contracted after being vaccinated
7167533 mandatory vaccination of the entire population at the discretion of the director of homeland security
7167534 i have a vaccination with the name of every american on it
7167535 we dealing with real injury to real children in a program that is funded by taxpayer dollars it is unbelievable to me that the president of the united states in the name of trying to help the drug industry would put the interests of the drug industry over the interests of neurologically impaired sick children and their parents
7167536 the creation production and proliferation of hiv aids through the secret federal virus development program
7167537 we can begin with the most critical problem of all population growth short of a nuclear war itself it is the greatest issue the world faces over the decades ahead either the current birth rates must come down more quickly or the current death rates must go up there is no other way
7167538 one must take draconian measures of demographic reduction against the will of the populations reducing the birth rate has proved to be impossible or insufficient one must therefore increase the mortality rate how by natural means famine and sickness
7167539 today americans would be outraged if un troops entered los angeles to restore order tomorrow they will be grateful this is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond whether real or promulgated that threatened our very existence it is then that all peoples of the world will plead with world leaders to deliver them from this evil the one thing that every man fears is the unknown when presented with this scenario individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well being granted to them by their world government
7167540 cargills view is that they generally regard the united states as a grain colony
7167541 when in 1979 the russians invaded afghanistan and jimmy carter asked how much grain the russians had bought from the united states we couldnt tell him because we didnt know
7167542 when cargill sells a cargo of corn to a dutch animal feed manufacturer the grain is shipped down the mississippi river put aboard a vessel at baton rouge and sent to rotterdam on paper however its route is more elaborate cargill first sells the corn to tradax international in panama which will hire tradax geneva as its agent tradax geneva then might arrange the sale to a dutch miller through its subsidiary tradax holland any profits would be booked to tradax panama a tax haven company and tradax geneva would earn only a management fee for brokering the deal between tradax panama and tradax holland

7167545 suggests that natos action in kosovo could be a model for future international relations
7167546 this is a conflict we are fighting not for territory but for values for a new internationalism where the brutal repression of whole ethnic groups will no longer be tolerated for a world where those responsible for such crimes have nowhere to hide we are fighting for a world where dictators are no longer able to visit horrific punishments on their own peoples in order to stay in power
7167547 establishing the principle that outside countries can intervene in a sovereign state to halt ethnic cleansing would mark a radical shift in the basic norms of international relations and mr blairs remarks will provoke unease among many countries

7167550 is that they are a very degenerate group there is a terrible incidence of alcoholism and drug abuse the mental stability of large elements of the press is more open to question than that of many other comparable groups in society a number of them are ignorant lazy opiniated intellectually dishonest and inadequately supervised
7167551 the individual journalist if he has any panache or talent becomes something of a celebrity much of his social life is built up on the press circuit bars hangers on media groupies the stifling and depraved gossip of the degenerate little media community and the fawning of unfulfilled women boys and hucksters journalism tends to attract the sort of person who settles whimsically on it as a calling or comes to it after disappointments elsewhere because of the relative ease of entry into the field these people discouraged and purposeless are easily influenced by their angrier colleagues it is by inadvertence inexperience the investigative nature of the press the antithetical role of the employee and the negligence of the employer and not by any organized subversion that the press veered away from being a mirror to society and became a perverse sort of irregular and often disloyal opposition

7167574 i cant tell you how excited i am by the now complete ticket of my party
7167575 senator bidens speech today was truly awe inspiring only in america can a working class kid from scranton overcome adversity and run on a major party ticket
7167576 senator biden hasnt forgotten where he came from he doesnt spend his time trying to decide between seven different options to hang has hat at night he commutes every day by amtrak from wilmington to washington
7167577 i understand that many supporters of senator clinton wanted to see the new york senator on the ticket with senator obama our party and our proposed platform are stronger than ever today because of the real primary discussion that took place across this country
7167578 if those who did not initially support senator obama do not all get on board with our democratic ticket were faced with eight more years of the same failed republican policies
7167579 politics is like a soap opera you can be away for six months come back and you havent missed much

7167584 i can do everything through him who gives me strength
7167585 god who gave us life gave us liberty can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of god indeed i tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just that his justice cannot sleep forever
7167586 i predict future happiness for americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them
7167587 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself
7167588 you have a choice be a fighting liberal or sit quietly i know what i am what are you
7167589 paul we admire you and all so dont get us wrong youre handsome dynamic youve acquired a national following because you take the right positions that we too would love to take and lord knows you can get the parishioners to kick in to the collection plate until it hurts
7167590 and while you may be a democrat youre not our kind of democrat we have someone else in mind a well oiled beltway insider you mayve heard of him his names sherrod brown and hes already in congress hes our man
7167591 so while we admire you for bringing out the vote and helping turn a red district bluer lets just say that even if you win the democratic primary dont count on our support so go back to shaking sand out of your boxer shorts in baghdad ok sport thanks and have a nice war that we fully intend to continue funding forever
7167592 what is he going to tell me that i dont already know
7167593 you have a deep feeling deep down inside of you that is burning to express itself
7167594 the athletes have had so much amazing success here and there were some superb performances and its a huge honour and im very proud to be able to carry the flag on behalf of the entire team canada in the closing ceremoines tonight
7167595 when sylvie bernier canadas chef de mission called me to tell me the news i was shocked and excited and ive been smiling all day and for me this will probably be my last olympic games so carrying the flag tonight will be a wonderful experience but a little emotional for me as well
7167596 i think its just a great way to end these olympics which have been so amazing
7167597 when i am right you have to be wrong if you dont agree with me

7167608 it is the first time in europe since the cold war that a foreign army has entered the territory of a sovereign state without any internationally accepted legal basis
7167609 if we were to be ambivalent about this it would give tacit approval to put our country and our citizens under threat
7167610 it is the only way for our country to protect our national security and sovereignty when the borders of nato expand so too does the region of peace and stability
7167611 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7167612 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7167613 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7167614 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7167615 there were many tense expeditions when we were in close proximity to soviet submarines and ships
7167616 being on a sub it was constantly impressed upon us who the enemy was there would be little posters reminding us to be quiet if you accidentally closed a hatch or door too hard that sound could actually emit out into the water and give your position away
7167617 for about two weeks we were in the north atlantic in a covert area and it was necessary to remain at periscope depth which is 50 feet underwater
7167618 it was hard to stay at that depth without breaking the surface and giving away our position it was extremely tense for those two weeks wed spend six hour watches in the control room just leaning over the steering mechanism with our eyes glued to the gauges as the sub bobbed up and down in the water another time we were discovered by the soviets and had to make a quick getaway
7167619 it was as close to the real thing as we could get
7167620 we had the missile launchers ready and we were all manned up we could go to war at a seconds notice not a minutes notice
7167621 while we were doing it we were using our radar to look into russia but of course we didnt tell them that
7167622 i said were not going out on deck we dont know if theyre shooting or what we checked every missile and it was the only time that ive ever seen the ready to load light steady on the monitor we sat there for a long time and eventually the captain came on and said what happened and to stand down
7167623 you lived under an air of suspicion and intrigue at the same time
7167624 being young soldiers you also had an air of cockiness about you and you felt invincible
7167625 but later i found out that this happened on a regular basis
7167626 you lived your normal life and did your job but you always looked over your shoulder wondering if you were being followed and you had to be careful what you said now as someone thats more stable in life i wonder how we lived through that but back then we loved what we were doing every soldier there was ready to do everything he could to preserve freedom
7167627 for the older georgians who remember the soviet domination i think theyre scared to death that its all going to come back
7167628 everything from communism to the social injustice and tyranny that marked that era it upsets me also because ive seen what its like for three years behind the wall and if you havent lived it you dont know what it is
7167629 regardless of who started the conflict between russia and georgia russia is taking their time to leave
7167630 if youve ever seen the dark shadow of old world communism before the wall fell its scary we had a saying when you went into east berlin you set your watch back 20 years they were that oppressed and a lot of them didnt even realize it
7167631 we had the opportunity to see how the other side lived and i actually enjoyed the experience i think it gives you a different outlook on life you dont take everything for granted and sometimes theres a price to be paid for things its a shame that we have to have it but when somebody threatens your lifestyle theres an opportunity to protect it
7167632 the groups operating in europe dont need a lot of money the cost of operations is very low
7167633 monday and tuesday next week we will be holding dialogues with local officials bishops and ulamas and different people in the areas affected so that we can take a closer look at the situation and try to see what is the best way of restoring normalcy to the life of everyone there
7167634 if they truly want the peace process to continue under the process of law they themselves invoke we expect them fully to cooperate with our systems of justice
7167635 to us the main objective is to bring peace and stability in this area
7167636 no they leave us alone and we leave them alone
7167637 no they might encourage people to observe islamic law but most of us do so anyway
7167638 if anybody says anything bad about the taliban theyll go after them
7167639 why is the government bombing our homes the taliban want to bring peace to the area
7167640 it is because of these atrocities that people are giving the militants more and more sympathy
7167641 she would describe an experiment and say thanks to allah it turned out well
7167642 what we have learned from her is that she was in custody for over five years
7167643 i have no doubt that there really are real terrorists out there but she isnt one of them
7167644 theres no doubt that there was one thing that the two parties agreed on getting rid of musharraf
7167645 musharraf stepping down at some level closes a chapter for pakistan its the last gate on the way back to democracy but that doesnt mean that democracy will be easier than dictatorship
7167646 the army wants the government to lead and take the political responsibility for going after the extremists so that the armys present unpopularity does not get worse
7167647 but mr sharif has no intention to become the cats paw of the army while mr zardari so far cannot hammer out a common coalition position
7167648 wants no concessions to the army and offers no support to the war against taliban extremists aware of his right wing vote bank he has little time for american demands
7167649 we have to also be offering a long term partnership with pakistan pakistani leaders suspect that if we succeed with al qaeda we will pull away from pakistan
7167650 weve done little to assure them that we see something beyond this very focused effort on terrorism
7167651 there is no escape from the fact that pakistan will be better off with a civilian government than a military dictatorship by and large the administration has accepted this
7167652 pakistan will become completely a democracy when there is civilian ownership of the security apparatus and foreign policy
7167653 the real difficulty for the u s is to make sure that with your actions you dont make the fragile civilian government more fragile
7167654 i probably didnt hit it as good as today as i did yesterday but my putter really got hot
7167655 its great to get the putter rolling obviously it helps your score but it helps your psyche as well
7167656 its hard to complain with 67 but it was one of those rounds that really could have been something special
7167657 i had some opportunities on the front nine i let get away and then i had opportunities on the back some holes i didnt take advantage of its nice to be in the hunt but it was one of those could of should of
7167658 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7167659 when we thought about doing the canal exhibit we felt that there was a void in our local history in that no one was really talking about the 19th century here in dover and the canal
7167660 theres obviously zoar that covers that time period but we wanted to do something locally that kind of shared that rich history with the public
7167661 it says something to see a grown man get giddy over our trains
7167662 so many times people look at a historical society as kind of old guard
7167663 we always are going to have our history and education based activities but we have to do other things to help get folks interested in the sites as an alternative for something to do on a friday or saturday night
7167664 a lot of kids today are going to relate to the toys and realize that some have been around for a hundred years
7167665 i think if you are willing to look theres so much here locally to do with the history arts restaurants music
7167666 we are really fortunate and blessed to have all of this around
7167667 the speaking fee for musharraf would be in the 150 000 200 000 range for a day
7167668 plus jet and other v i p arrangements on the ground
7167669 if we did multiple events in multiple cities musharraf could get closer to the 500 000 to 1 000 000 range for a series of talks

7167675 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7167676 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them
7167677 it is a high risk gamble the army is taking and they must be careful to ensure that they dont repeat the mistakes of the past and spread themselves too thinly

7167691 playing nicely into the hands of syria which is using it to strengthen its ties with an old and resurrected friend send messages to a traditional foe israel and pressure the united states into changing course over damascus
7167692 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel
7167693 both assad and hezbollah are hoping to get new weapons systems from russia and greater diplomatic backing
7167694 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers
7167695 save me from myself how i found god quit korn kicked drugs and lived to tell my story
7167696 right now weve got an in store record store tour
7167697 id say both in the beginning i was stressed out but i was having fun i was goin through challenges ya know when you do methamphetamine it messes with your emotions and mind and stuff partying for that many years its like a kid goin to the candy store every day sooner or later hes gonna end up sick and unhealthy ya know after time passes you start to become more normal again but i had a lot of fits or rage i would break things in the studio if things didnt go my way so that had to go but the times when things were goin really good were fun while i was going through those challenges i could take time off i would take like even six months off ya know in 2006 i hadnt done music for a while and just wanted to take a break it was cool to do that because there was no pressure there was no one tellin me dude you gotta get into the studio and finish this weve got a deadline there was no deadline it was just whatever happened ya know everything happened the way it was supposed to because im a new man now im totally calm when things dont do my way i dont freak out im just a new person and it feels great
7167698 i want to pledge full commitment towards modern democracy based on multi party competition periodic election and the rule of law democracy now must belong to the people and remain a formal political system
7167699 the first and foremost duty of the government and the people will be to protect sovereignty national independence and territorial integrity if nepal does not exist anything else including the republic will lose its meaning
7167700 i appeal to the nepal army armed police force nepal police and the national investigation department to forget the past and extend their full support to maintain national unity there will be no prejudice against them from our side
7167701 we will certainly match peoples expectations in a planned and phased manner we have set our priorities a balanced approach to integrate the interest of the mountains hills and the plains will be adopted so that national unity is further strengthened
7167702 the country will build modern industrial economy in which private public partnership will be encouraged and promoted foreign investments will also be encouraged

7167708 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7167709 it would be good to have a health food restaurant here
7167710 but to tell you the truth i would probably just go to mcdonalds because thats what i know
7167711 talking to people over the last 10 to 15 years they have consistently demanded more grocery stores and sit down restaurants
7167712 we have precious little land left to develop in the district
7167713 we think they are a great asset in that community
7167714 south l a is a food desert of massive proportions you have a city completely divided not only in the ways so familiar to folks but in terms of actual food access in the face of that a general call to action is taking place
7167715 no matter where they put those restaurants if people want that they will drive to get it
7167716 not many people around here are ready to pay 5 for berries
7167717 limiting peoples food options is not really the way to go nor is it the role of government to tell people what they should or should not be eating french fries arent contraband
7167718 mas claro que n o podemos nem sonhar em equilibrar o ensino do brasil com pa ses desenvolvidos
7167719 they just missed me but hit the two trucks behind
7167720 this road used to be safe but in the last month theyve been attacking more and more
7167721 if the afghan army isnt there a fly cannot pass
7167722 the talebans trying to cut the main roads to kabul to target supplies for foreign forces just like the mujahidin did with the soviets if the highways are cut even for two days it could also create riots in the city
7167723 he also says that the moolahs have been to all the villages and laid the people under ban not to assist the english and that consequently the mussulman population are as one man against us
7167724 the taleban will surround kabul politically and militarily to make it hard for nato forces to receive logistic convoys
7167725 that will mean less nato movement and will show we can make trouble in the capital
7167726 in no sense have they created or can they make a strategic threat to the government of afghanistan
7167727 were fine for fuel and food with the air power we have and the quality of troops on the ground there is no way they can win
7167728 they used to warn us not to supply the infidel
7167729 if they catch me now theyll throw me in my own container cover me in petrol and burn me alive
7167730 what is it about summer camp that keeps drawing you back for more
7167731 jan harriott my name is and i will be happy to have you be a part of the centrifuge carson newman team you will serve as the development director a k a dd and teach the resource track and for girls only varsity fgov track
7167732 the essence of being truly alive comes with falling in love with the pursuit of your dreams always stretching always in momentum always expecting the best
7167733 exceptions faults i made sure there where no server client certificate or ssl issues but that did not seem to be the issue
7167734 the fundamental advantage of thin film comes in the form of the amount of material you need
7167735 these are direct bandgap semiconductors you can get by with one or two microns and still absorb 98 percent of the sunlight
7167736 the second is efficiency how much sunlight can be converted to power and the third is the reliability which means the lifetime of the device
7167737 benchtop is a great thing to measure because it tells you about the potential of the technology it tells you nothing however about what people are actually making or can make
7167738 by the time you go into production youre going to get about half
7167739 we see thin film as highly complementary to crystalline and concentrators
7167740 the elegance of the solar business is that you construct a product and it just sits there generating power for 20 to 25 years
7167741 glass can be returned to the glass industry metals can be repurified and given back to us in the form of the cadmium telluride compound even the wires can be reused
7167742 we really can recycle in excess of 90 percent of the weight of the product today in a perpetual environmentally friendly life cycle
7167743 you have the opportunity with thin film to make what people refer to as a semitransparent photovoltaic module in place of a window on a building it allows you to see out through the window but from the outside it looks like tinted glass
7167744 its going to serve the purpose of keeping out the elements but its also going to generate power for you
7167745 in a very good way i am through the looking glass the unicorn man instantly antiquates everything that has come out in the past 20 years the unicorn man is not casual entertainment it is a vivisected contradictory juxtaposition of dark yet illuminating imagery with the voice of an otherworldly prophet vox anon wildly pinballs between epic epiphanies and intimate vignettes the unicorn man unfolds the tragic aspirations of becoming a new creature but is brutally aware of the relentless limitations of the frail spiritual condition i want to compare it to another book but i cannot even think of something like it it is a carnival ride that could fall apart as soon as it reaches the peak the unicorn man is dangerous but the elevated view is worth the risk this book has the potential to be one of the great works of poetry for the new millennium we need more art like this
7167746 wow talk about an intense and personal ecclesiastical insight i didnt know what to expect and this cut me down at the knees i dont know who this author thinks he she is but he she is hauntingly similar to you or me with the guts to explore the desire for more and plenty of that same familiar blood on the hands it can be at both inscrutable out of reach and alarmingly close almost too close for comfort there is ache and ecstasy and the whiff of a red narrative that holds the verses together in a unit definitely a challenge definitely well worth the digging
7167747 we came in here knowing full well that it was a half and a half and that it would be a good go for our team as well as the jets playing their starters for a half we went ahead and followed through with that plan offensively and we had a chance we were down there in the tight green zone and didnt come away with any points at all anytime you do that you are pretty much going to regret that toward the end of the game
7167748 its ridiculous first of all we shouldnt be directing israels policy if thats true second it is mistake not to let israel if it wishes to if its sees an opportunity because they know the area better than we do to go out and explore possibilities with the syrians
7167749 in my 34 year career i have never wavered from the notion that the only time progress has ever been made in the middle east is when the arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us and israel so the idea of being the honest broker is not i think like some of my democratic colleagues call for is not the answer it is being the smart broker it is being the smart partner
7167750 its a little bit like my saying to you as a woman taking you down in the middle of the night through the bowery and saying look im supporting you completely and you get out of the car and you walk the next 20 blocks through the bowery
7167751 ive had my shouting matches over 25 years privately in my office and in the offices of prime ministers ive had disagreements israels a democracy and they make mistakes but the notion that somehow if israel just did the right thing this would work i mean thats the premise give me a break
7167752 well mom why dont you just call the muffin man
7167753 the fact that i am expecting a child is my john edwards in any way andrew young is the father of my unborn child
7167754 rielle told me she had a secret affair with edwards when she found out that she was pregnant she said he was the father
7167755 anyone who knows me knows that i have been in with the same woman for 30 plus years
7167756 the innuendos and lies that have appeared on the john edwards are not true completely unfounded and ridiculous
7167757 whoa slow down there im sure france had some victories somewhere
7167758 frances armies are victorious only when not led by a frenchman
7167759 france only wins when america does most of the fighting
7167760 going to war without france is like going deer hunting without an accordion all
7167761 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
7167762 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
7167763 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
7167764 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
7167765 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
7167766 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
7167767 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
7167768 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

7167770 a very good drink they call chaube that is almost as black as ink and very good in illness especially of the stomach this they drink in the morning early in the open places before everybody without any fear or regard out of clay or china cups as hot as they can sipping it a little at a time
7167771 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7167772 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7167773 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7167774 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7167775 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7167776 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7167777 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7167778 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7167779 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7167780 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7167781 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7167783 my father told me if i enlisted id get more money for school so i did
7167784 i saw that the army would pay me more and i felt more comfortable in that environment
7167785 they came up to me and said you know sir there will be no special favors and i said hooah
7167786 i knew it was broken so i just self medicated
7167787 i hurt myself now and then but im still functional
7167788 my favorite part of the job is mentoring young soldiers
7167789 its taking people with nothing and giving them the opportunity to do something more
7167790 its a known fact that 80 percent of the casualties in vietnam were from hemorrhage
7167791 ill be back the day after i retire as part of retiree recall
7167792 we should seek a steady mutual draw down to a ceiling of no
7167793 nato should abandon its anachronistic posture the defense of biden also attacked bushs handling of human rights violations
7167794 no one can expect that trade sanctions against beijing would yield a sudden transformation of that regime but american foreign policy should leave no doubt and the bush administration has left much doubt that the united states stands squarely on the side of chinas brave and aspiring democrats to whom power will ultimately flow
7167795 1922 an awful dive from adebayor we dont need to see that
7167796 returned to the general area of where it came from
7167797 people in the emerging culture do not really want or need such a definition
7167798 its use of institutional structures systematic theology use of propositional teaching methods a perceived preoccupation with buildings attractional understanding of mission trying to bring people into the church rather than improving their world professional clergy overemphasis on the facade of goodness and the perceived preoccupation of conservative christians in the political process
7167799 the sharing of experiences and interactions such as testimonies prayer group recitation sharing meals and other communal practices
7167800 sorry but we are its a sociological reality but lets not stay here it is a journey its time for genuine partnership
7167801 un learning the other worldly emphasis of much modern christianity the increasing focus on heaven afterlife etc that marked much of 20th century christianity

7167809 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7167810 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7167811 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7167812 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7167813 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7167814 if we look at how much more water we will need for food and how much more for biomass for energy going forward it is quite worrying
7167815 almost every increase in water used in agriculture will affect water availability for other uses including that needed to keep ecosystems healthy and resilient in the face of change and perturbation
7167816 it might be environmentally reasonable to withdraw maybe 6 000 cubic kilometres but if we withdraw more water it would be at a very high environmental cost because we need water to flush the system and for different ecosystem services
7167817 by 2030 the same amount of energy that we produce today with fossil fuels will have to come from biomass
7167818 meet food demands by 2050 if we have a much more efficient use of water that does not include the water we need for all that biomass
7167819 we are at the end of the road when it comes to irrigation because all the water available in rivers and so on has already been now more or less used up
7167820 in a large part of africa if you look at the total rainfall throughout the year the amount is usually enough to grow many crops
7167821 if you can capture that rainfall and store it as soil moisture or in local dams it would be possible to significantly increase food production in these areas

7167828 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7167829 we were still very low very close to the ground

7167832 ik ben weg bij feyenoord waarom ik had er tot mijn honderdste kunnen werken als je praktisch alles hebt meegemaakt kom je in een cirkel terecht waarin alles herkenbaar wordt ik heb gekozen voor een totaal nieuwe uitdaging met alle risicos die daarbij horen ik zal weer veel moeten leren in een wereld die totaal anders is dan het voetbalwereldje in het leven krijg je maar een paar momenten om je kansen te pakken meestal kiezen de mensen uiteindelijk toch voor veiligheid en zekerheid ik heb gewoon gekozen voor de nieuwe uitdaging waar ik dan niet te maken krijg met de druk van de media maar wellicht met andere soort spanningen spanningen waar ik tot nu toe goed mee om kon gaan spanning is anders dan de stress waarin veel mensen verkeren in mijn optiek is stress een van de belangrijkste oorzaken van het ontstaan van kwalen het is voor iedereen belangrijk een balans te vinden tussen gezonde stress en ontspanning
7167833 als je ziet wat een man van eenenzeventig allemaal nog doet bij de club dan teken ik er voor ook zo gezond te zijn als ik die leeftijd heb als hij dan zegt dat zijn goede conditie voor een belangrijk deel te wijten is aan de producten van pro natura vooral de honingpollen dan sta ik in de rij om dit goede advies van gerard op te volgen
7167834 we were cruising but when you are cruising youve got to keep working hard and we stopped
7167835 its annoying because we feel like weve lost after being in such a commanding position
7167836 it was a very strong finish by us and i would have fancied ourselves to score the next goal but on the balance of play we have to be satisfied with a point
7167837 we needed to do something after going two behind and im very glad that we managed to do that thanks to arturo
7167838 the boys need a pat on the back for keeping going and we are a super fit side so today it has all paid off
7167839 i am today able to announce that a 5 000 reward is being offered for information which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible
7167840 anyone with information about the murders of the two victims should contact northumbria police
7167841 inquiries are continuing with police forces across the uk to establish if any links exist between the murders in newcastle and any other part of the country
7167842 it is too early to give detailed information but at this time we do not appear to have any similar murder inquiries throughout the country

7167847 todas las actividades del contingente de mantenimiento de la paz ruso se basan en los seis puntos que fueron firmados en el acuerdo de alto el fuego ndr por los presidentes de rusia y francia
7167848 es la primera vez desde la guerra fr a que en europa un ej rcito extranjero entra en territorio de un estado soberano sin el aval de un mandato jur dico internacional

7167857 individualmente ninguno de los dos estaba capacitado para el puesto que ocupaba juntos eran un desastre

7167859 the difference is that the easy to use tools available for blogging take away the barriers to getting online
7167860 people need to think long and hard about whether theyre comfortable blogging about work in an unprotected way
7167861 when you start a blog you have to assume youre going to be found out
7167862 if the company has a policy on blogging thats the first thing that workers should check
7167863 if you blog about unionising you may get more protection than you would otherwise
7167864 being anonymous is very important because it allows me to say what i want to say
7167865 it allows individuals to post information about themselves others and their business to a wider audience than they would normally meet in person
7167866 you really only want to connect with people you know and trust
7167867 the strength of your network really comes from relationships you have with the people youre connected to
7167868 you dont want salesmen hitting up every person in your network
7167869 if you want mass market you probably want to be in portals like myspace and facebook
7167870 get involved in community and focus groups and participate in discussions
7167871 dont tell hashrake i said so but this was an easy call
7167872 that fool is an embarrassment to himself the club and the game i mean fine hes still producing offensively but have you seen him in the outfield its positively duncanesque and im pretty sure he tweaked a knee a while back but he wont admit that hes injured and go on the dl to rehab
7167873 we needed to let him go but we want to let him down easy
7167874 under that tough exterior hes a sensitive guy and in this crappy work softball league hell be a total rock star sure hes a total doucher but the boy can mash

7167877 la situaci n es tranquila el s bado por la tarde se tiene que realizar el traslado de los inmigrantes a otros centros de acogida en italia
7167878 hasta ahora estados unidos era el abogado de rusia cuando se trataba de integrarla en el seno de la comunidad mundial hemos admitido a rusia en el seno del grupo de pa ses m s industrializados g8 y hemos saludado y alentado su deseo de entrar en la omc todo eso est ahora en juego
7167879 en esta situaci n de crisis no hay que descartar opciones el gobierno ruso debe reflexionar sobre sus intereses
7167880 es la agon a de la derecha fascista y racista
7167881 hasta un total de 35 militantes murieron y muchos otros resultaron heridos cuando las fuerzas de seguridad lanzaron una operaci n masiva en el distrito de kabal en el valle de swat

7167885 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7167886 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7167887 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7167888 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7167889 i dont want to criticise those other sports but certainly after every olympics and indeed every time we come round to a funding round there will be serious work done analysing the programs that are in place
7167890 los rusos valoran el sentido del humor para ser cosmonauta
7167891 al principio lo importante del viaje era ir y volver
7167892 futuras misiones tripuladas a la estaci n espacial internacional iss en sus siglas en ingl s la luna y m s all
7167893 tenemos ocho en activo y su media de edad es de 50 a os
7167894 con la estaci n espacial acabada a la esa le corresponder aproximadamente un astronauta por a o
7167895 la esa est preparando sus equipos para tomar parte en las misiones de vuelo espacial tripuladas del siglo xxi el sistema solar es el pr ximo objetivo de la exploraci n humana
7167896 los astronautas pasar n su tiempo volando entrenando o apoyando la preparaci n de otros programas espaciales con su valiosa experiencia
7167897 desde luego tiene que ser cient fico o ingeniero porque la principal ocupaci n en la nave son los experimentos y es necesario comprenderlos al menos un poco pero adem s de la formaci n tienes que haber aplicado tus conocimientos en el trabajo con responsabilidad y tambi n haber demostrado capacidad operativa
7167898 haber llevado a cabo actividades en las que uno podr a tener problemas si no hubiera hecho las cosas bien
7167899 situaciones como bucear con botellas escalar u otras que requieren solventar el riesgo por ti mismo e integr ndote en un equipo
7167900 el perfil ideal es el de alguien que trabaja en equipo y que tambi n es capaz de tomar decisiones muy r pidas
7167901 mis colegas rusos siempre han valorado entre sus candidatos a cosmonautas el sentido del humor que ayuda a reconducir una situaci n complicada sta es una cualidad que tiene por ejemplo pedro duque
7167902 esta universidad es una conspiraci n benigna que permite tender lazos entre los futuros profesionales de empresas y agencias para facilitar la colaboraci n internacional rompiendo las din micas que surgieron en la guerra fr a
7167903 hay varios que est n participando en las pruebas de la esa y en general un tercio de nuestros alumnos declaran que quieren ser astronautas hay quien podr a pensar que deber an ser m s pero tambi n se debe tener en cuenta que por razones personales o familiares muchos profesionales que trabajan en las agencias y empresas espaciales no quieren volar
7167904 es una misi n peligrosa y tengo que estar seguro de que todos mis asuntos personales est n en orden en caso de que no vuelva a mi hogar
7167905 porque siento una pasi n ardiente dentro de m por participar en la exploraci n espacial
7167906 la buena salud es la caracter stica fundamental del astronauta porque disminuye mucho los riesgos de la misi n incluso es importante intentar prever si podr a desarrollar enfermedades a un cierto plazo
7167907 lo que los robots llevados a marte necesitan tres a os para hacer un buen ge logo lo resolver a en dos d as y har a m s cosas
7167908 la presencia de pilotos se explica porque en los primeros vuelos lo importante era el viaje en s ir y volver
7167909 los astronautas son ahora las manos y los ojos en el espacio de los cient ficos
7167910 un comandante y un vicecomandante que deber an ser pilotos un m dico un ge logo un bi logo un ingeniero experto en los sistemas de la nave y otro ingeniero civil especializado en construcci n para cuando est n all
7167911 la profesi n de astronauta va a seguir siendo selectiva porque los programas espaciales no s lo no est n creciendo en presupuesto sino que est n decreciendo
7167912 para que se puedan instalar bases en la luna tendremos que hallar alguna forma de retorno econ mico al menos ofrecer una esperanza de encontrarla
7167913 los pa ses que tienen m s ilusi n son china y la india y esa ilusi n por ser astronauta llevar a la universidad a cientos de miles de j venes que se dejar n la piel y quiz no llegar n a conseguirlo pero se convertir n en los cient ficos e ingenieros que har n de sus pa ses las primeras potencias econ micas mientras nosotros nos quedamos atr s
7167914 aunque se retrasasen los programas lunares previstos para el 2020
7167915 es posible que esta nueva generaci n pueda ir a la luna durante su vida activa
7167916 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point

7168049 joe has been around the democratic party for a long time so he can be a bridge between the established network and the new people with the obama campaign
7168050 for those who like to suggest that obama is a fresh face and we dont know what he would do in a tough situation now he has a partner who we know will be there to ensure the right decision
7168051 but it doesnt change my mind one bit bottom line is he is hitching a ride on obamas train not steering it
7168052 as our troops continue to move toward victory in the global war on terror we need leaders who not only have the experience to lead us to victory but who agree on a plan to get there

7168057 i think the last time i was here i suggested that this was going to happen and a lot of people were quite skeptical
7168058 all this was a big joke it got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be
7168059 i dont believe it does affect my credibility at all because this is bigfoot
7168060 it would be one thing if i came out and said that i had something else that is tangible or real but right now as far as im concerned there is no real bigfoot

7168069 the government of mexico asked us to give the cemex businessmen another chance to see if we can reach an understanding
7168070 but the mexicans of this company have been arrogant very arrogant and we demand respect here buddy
7168071 we want to settle this in a friendly way like we did with the french who stay on here as our partners
7168072 challenged the government and i dont know what else at the meetings
7168073 you know mr president that first and foremost i defend the interests of my homeland the interests of my people not those of businessmen
7168074 i think the challenge here is changing the culture and putting together a situation with rick to get this place competitive

7168076 one guy called the center who was a 4 0 student and married the cheerleader

7168079 as the army moves closer they will have to rely more on infantry
7168080 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7168081 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them

7168092 we gave up a sloppy goal in the first half
7168093 i told the guys they were passing the ball well i told them to get back in the game keep a good effort and you will be able to do something in the final third
7168094 when you have been out six weeks you just have to take everything one game at a time with an injury like that
7168095 i got a great pass and was able to get a clear shot
7168096 any time you are down in a game and you can salvage a point it feels like a small victory
7168097 i think we are trying to score the perfect goal instead of just trying to muscle it in like i did at the end

7168134 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7168135 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7168136 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7168137 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7168138 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7168139 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7168140 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7168141 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote

7168151 they went off so quickly in the first kilometre i deliberately backed off the pace
7168152 but i always thought more athletes would start coming back and they did im a little disappointed not to make the top 20 but you can only do what you can
7168153 just assume your new digital camera is disposable because guaranteed whatever you pick it will be upgraded or obsolete in the next year in the interim while learning digital youve saved the cost of your camera body in the value of film amp processing alone

7168155 the leaders of this event do not support what the guy did
7168156 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgment there were a number of people that took offense to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7168157 well refund any foreign tax you pay but pay tax in my way
7168158 ah one of lawrence sanders archy mcnally books i havent read
7168159 morgans 25th century earth is convincing while the questions he poses about how much self is tied to body chemistry and how the rich believe themselves above the law are especially timely
7168160 in some troubled recess of the mind these days the dialogue or one resembling it plays on in endless repetitions
7168161 the first time it was sold out in 15 minutes
7168162 they all started putting their hands over their ears the parents asked if i could turn the music off
7168163 mastercard told me the nearest no fee atm is 33 miles away by the time i pay for gas to drive there and back i might as well pay the fees
7168164 the program offers multiple ways to get money without fees
7168165 tellers at any bank displaying the mastercard logo thats roughly 3 000 banks in missouri will provide cash from the card without a fee and the card can be used at any merchant that takes mastercard and the user can even get cash back
7168166 we seem to have a system that invites abusive and excessive fees
7168167 at the same time were having these mass layoffs that have highlighted the problems the workers here have a union with the ability to deal with the problem but a lot of people out there are running into these kinds of problems but dont even know who to call
7168168 its not unreasonable for the bank to get a fee for providing a service to the state
7168169 but that fee should come from the government contract not from the pockets of unemployment recipients
7168170 the labor department says it costs 1 50 to send out a check
7168171 one of my members said hed rather just pay it upfront compared with 5 in fees it starts looking pretty reasonable
7168172 he would just stand over him and tell him what to do
7168173 some people didnt take a maintenance job seriously but he really took it with his whole heart
7168174 in his short stint here he turned the amphitheater around
7168175 he lent stability to our entire family he was very calming and very patient but he didnt put up with any nonsense
7168176 anytime he was around i knew everything would be all right
7168177 they always put him where he could escort the family he wouldnt be one of the bikes in the back
7168178 theres a huge hole out there that we wont be able to fill
7168179 if teachers would slow down they would be less frustrated the children would be less frustrated and children would learn with greater ease
7168180 theres a reason children were so captivated and mesmerized by mr rogers
7168181 ill say its time to go or seat belts are safe choices and he just gives me this look
7168182 let me tell you folks it only gets better from here
7168183 its so amazing that with wars in iraq and afghanistan the united states has the manpower and equipment to come and put a show on like this
7168184 my wife finally gets to see some of the things i do on my job
7168185 vets from that war always come up and just sort of look i think it brings back some bad memories for them but they still seem to like to see it
7168186 itll go faster but i had to shut it down early because i just put new brakes on it
7168187 were it not for the duke lacrosse case she likely would be described as a bright young woman from durham north carolina who has had a difficult life
7168188 usually consumers have saved the day by coming in and spending
7168189 but they did that with credit and now credit conditions are very tough
7168190 at the macro level it is difficult to see where increasing spending is going to come from
7168191 it is imperative to keep the customers you have under these circumstances it is important to make sure customers are happy
7168192 for apple to move up 8 percent is very high
7168193 they probably benefited from the difficulties most of the other pc makers had with vista

7168211 how and why julio c sar gallegoss body ended up on the scorched desert terrain of southern california is the outgrowth of many factors contingent and structural incidental and historical
7168212 while shaped to a significant degree by physical forces geographic space is largely a social creation in terms of what is contained within it how it is divided up and bounded and how it is perceived and lived it is thus a product of power relations and all the conflict as well as cooperation that they entail
7168213 from a mere line on a map to a powerful divide and associated set of practices of inclusion and exclusion
7168214 is not so much to stop migration but to define the status of people as subordinate once they have arrived
7168215 wavemax is so well thought out easy to use and cost effective its hard to think of a reason not to give it a try

7168222 it was a tough start there is a lot of rust i have to shake off
7168223 i am glad coach gruden gave me the opportunity to stay in there and continue to compete and thankfully we put a drive together and finished it off well
7168224 i made two very poor decisions tonight which is very unlike me and i think it shows that i havent practiced a lot and havent played at all
7168225 those are things i needed to get out of my system hopefully i can move on from here
7168226 hes ok he would keep going if we let him
7168227 the defense came out and started excellent and created turnovers that is the type of football we definitely want to try and play this year
7168228 offensively we capitalized and did some good things but of course we know we can get better
7168229 were capable of scoring definitely more than three runs a night
7168230 when were clicking were going to average about five runs a game when were really good once we get consistent and start scoring runs like we can and our pitching stays as good as its been were going to win quite a few games
7168231 were putting a lot of pressure on our pitchers because were not scoring runs
7168232 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7168233 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7168234 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7168235 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7168236 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7168237 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personal to step up in his absence
7168238 you litrally pour the broth into the tmahtos and then litrally pour th ole mixture over the prawns

7168247 o gr mio n o pode abrir mais vantagem mas o time que conseguir tr s quatro vit rias seguidas tem chance de subir e brigar o palmeiras est nessa condi o pois ainda faltam 17 rodadas
7168248 agora temos que pensar em trabalhar e buscar a vit ria contra o palmeiras de qualquer jeito porque vai ser um jogo muito dif cil
7168249 podemos at entrar com tr s atacantes mas n o ter medo de jogar se for para ter medo melhor nem jogar assim voc come a a dar confian a para o advers rio e ele fica em vantagem

7168254 a secret terrorist organization has been working within to destroy america its constitution and everything for which she stands
7168255 the very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies to secret oaths and to secret proceedings
7168256 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but morally treasonable to the american public
7168257 drunk with power we the u s are leading the world to hell in a new colonialism with the same old human slavery which once ruined us to a third world war which will ruin the world
7168258 the policy from the white house has been to allocate funds to religious institutions even those that channel those funds exclusively to their own particular group of believers in a particular religion
7168259 as a traditional baptist ive always believed in separation of church and state and honoured that premise when i was president and so have all other presidents i might say except this one
7168260 we negroes believe in the god of ethiopia the everlasting god god the son god the holy ghost the one god of all ages that is the god in whom we believe but we shall worship him through the spectacles of ethiopia
7168261 men occasionally stumble over the truth but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened
7168262 the notion that the church the press and the universitiesshould serve the state is essentially a communist notion in a free society these institutions must be wholly free which is to say that their function is to serve as checks upon the state
7168263 wolves are wolves even if you choose to pretend they are chickens
7168264 he who does not remember history is condemned to repeat it
7168265 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7168266 ecclesiasticism without christianity the discipline of a monastic rule not for gods sake or in order to achieve personal salvation but for the sake of the state and for the greater glory and power of the demagogue turned leader this was the goal for which the systematic moving of the masses was to lead
7168267 the illusion of freedom in america will continue as long as its profitable to continue the illusion at the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain they will just take down the scenery they will pull back the curtains they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater
7168268 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross
7168269 remember the inquisition it wont be long before the fires are ignited all over again
7168270 either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
7168271 it is time for protestants to go to the shepherd the pope and say what do we have to do to come home
7168272 we will get a new world order we may not get it in our generation but if we do not get it in our generation we will get it in the next generation
7168273 although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people it is true that most stupid people are conservative
7168274 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
7168275 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
7168276 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
7168277 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
7168278 converting his excellent ideas into workable stories and constructing plots in such a way as to make good use of his erudition were things that continued to cause de camp problems throughout his career a great many of his novels are merely episodic accounts of journeys whose protagonists encounter a series of strange situations this weakness of plot structure and design sometimes results in a lack of dramatic tension
7168279 take a conan type hero set him down on barsoom calling it however lemuria season thickly with elements reminiscent of amtor and other heroic locations including a very watered down law versus chaos struggle going on behind the scenes strain the whole through a sieve fine enough to remove virtually all elements of a characterization and b originality the only distinguishing feature that i am able to discern in the wizard of lemuria is that it is entirely derivative of other works in the genre with no obvious originality whatsoever add to this the absolute lifelessness of the characters even at his very worse which could admittedly be pretty abysmal at time edgar rice burroughs never created anybody quite this wooden he has done such an incompetent job that for a few moments there i thought he was writing a parody of swordplay and sorcery why does this book offend me because there is not an ounce of originality in it the people machines animals names everything has been assembled out of an old box of burroughs and howard fragments you and i have read it all before and can exact no pleasure from having the various pieces stirred together usually at random and served up as new stuff nor has it been written well ghu knows we have learned not to expect too much of our authors but we do expect them to rise above cliche once in awhile carter never does since carter doesnt read his own copy with any attention why should we there is more there is the awful poetry that alwys seems to adorn bad fantasy there are the ludicrous similes our dreaded dwark has slimy saliva reeking like an open grave i suppose if there were an idiot in the story he would have a needle pointed head am i being cruel perhaps but lin carter was cruel to me he promised me an action packed novel with vivid sword and sorcery impact and he did not deliver i read his book and i was not satisfied i wish he would go away and think about what i have said then sit down and try to write a more consistent and interesting book of his own it will take work but that is what he is being paid for i enjoy reading good sword amp sorcery therefore i will not accept the ersatz stuff
7168280 nur empfehlen schauen sie ihrer krankenkasse genau auf die finger und wechseln sie die kasse wenn sie mehr geld von ihnen verlangt
7168281 my objective is to grow in the event and get the title
7168282 my goal is to fight for the belt and do my best
7168283 wec champion urijah faber is the best of the world now to beat him i think you have to be in good shape hes an expert fighter and he has good gas its complicated to beat a guy like him you have to set a good game plan and be calm and watch the elbows because if you hits you it can change a whole fight
7168284 were going to try our hardest not to be violent
7168285 bei diesen geschwindigkeiten hast du zu tun das auto vern nftig auf der stra e zu halten

7168291 revolutionaries terrorists and troublemakers acting on behalf of russia or other foreign powers
7168292 these armenian political aspirations had not been legitimate their aspirations did not merely threaten to break up the turkish empire they could not be fulfilled without doing grave injustice to the turkish people itself
7168293 some 100 000 armenians may have died between 1915 and 1918 but this was no greater a percentage than that of the turks and other muslims who died as a result of the same conditions in the same places at the same time
7168294 there was no genocide committed against the armenians in the ottoman empire before or during world war i
7168295 the history of armenian kurdish relations in the ottoman empire
7168296 notes on two discordant histories armenia during world war i
7168297 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
7168298 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
7168299 pharmaceuticals are only present in very low concentrations and therefore could not be dangerous
7168300 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
7168301 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
7168302 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
7168303 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations
7168304 thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
7168305 against the insidious wiles of foreign influence a free people ought to be constantly awake
7168306 when you fellows have quite finished rotting about in front of that bath dont let me detain you
7168307 theres a lunatic in the school thats what i make of it a lunatic whose form of madness is wrecking studies
7168308 but the same chap couldnt have done yours and mine it must have been a donaldsons fellow who did mine and one of your chaps who did yours and mills
7168309 mills by jove of course i never thought of that that was the league too i suppose
7168310 yes one of those cards was tied to a chair but clowes took it away before anybody saw it
7168311 i was ass enough to keep a large pot full of it here and they used it all every drop you never saw such a sight
7168312 i want to see ohara about something or were you going somewhere else
7168313 i wasnt going anywhere in particular i never know what to do in term time its deadly dull
7168314 well then theres been a big fight and im one of the only chaps who know about it so far
7168315 by jove did you really where was it when did it come off was it a good one who won
7168316 you should be consuming bullys comics content on the regular
7168317 why isnt a little stuffed bull running the comics industry
7168318 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the text
7168319 were going home our mood is marvellous beautiful we came here experienced war and are going back in one piece
7168320 the only shame is we didnt make it to tbilisi
7168321 theres been no withdrawal from western georgia they are putting up checkpoints in the port of poti the ceasefire agreement clearly says that they dont have any right to block any major road or to be in major urban areas
7168322 its beautiful i feel a great weight has been lifted from my shoulders i feel free
7168323 youre right let me take a look at myself how can i change what can i do to make the situation better
7168324 if only wed worked at it more if only id been willing to change if only i had tried harder if only id given it more time and been a little more patient
7168325 when do i know when to leave how do i know when it is the right thing to do
7168326 a pair of kerouacs armed with sharpies and erasers and righteous indignation
7168327 i was reluctant to disfigure the sign any further still i think i shall be haunted by that perversity emense in my train whistle blighted dreams tonight
7168328 statement on the signage of our national parks and public lands to come
7168329 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
7168330 indicating its heightened concern over the afghanistan drug trade moscow dedicated one of its reconnaissance satellites to the issue
7168331 russia advances cooperation and interaction with afghanistan in the war on drug production and proliferation as for the office in kabul our representative there will be in charge of efficient interaction between russian and afghani structures dealing with trafficking with an emphasis needless to say on what channels lead to russia all of that will be carried out in close cooperation with our central asian colleagues
7168332 space control over afghan areas under drug cultivation is one of the projects
7168333 close links between the kosova albanians and the taliban and al qaeda
7168334 without the control and connivance on the part of the special services none of these things are possible for example in afghanistan the cia and the special services are quite brazen under the protection of the american army they meet the necessary people they collect the stuff go to the bagram airbase and they hand in a large consignment of narcotics which is then taken away
7168335 i tried to hop the fence and i got caught
7168336 its like fort knox you jump one fence and theres two more to jump theyve got guards theyve got cops theyve got people on horses there arent any infiltration points
7168337 somebody offered me 100 to look the other way and let him go over the fence
7168338 i wouldnt do it its not worth it theres only one way to do a job and thats the right way
7168339 these tickets are out of my price range way out of my range
7168340 and this is about the only free thing you can do at the festival
7168341 the streets were a mess the music is too loud and the park is fenced off golden gate park is a park not a concert stadium the city is supposed to be the guardians of the park not the broker for it
7168342 ive lived here for over 20 years and these are the worst folks in golden gate park ever screaming in the streets afterwards throwing shopping carts down the street running stop signs and there is absolutely no security to be seen hopefully this event will never be allowed again
7168343 this thing was dangerous with people pushing through a narrow 20 foot gap anxious to get to the next band in time people were desperate for bathrooms they were running past the guards through the woods just trying to find a place to pee
7168344 the park is trashed garbage everywhere not sure how they got a permit for the music to be so loud i love radiohead but that was ridiculous i think the neighborhood has had enough of these mega events leave no trace my a
7168345 wow this is really it he is choosing not to be with me he thinks his life would be better without me this hurts like hell
7168346 en lo que sea nuestra obligaci n vamos a cumplir el congreso y el tribunal son organismos distintos nuestro papel es analizar estos decretos estrictamente en materia jurisprudencial constitucional y no tenemos por qu sentir presi n de nadie

7168373 realmente cruz azul se vio mejor que monterrey futbol sticamente tuvimos un error de cata al jalar al delantero y ellos toman la ventaja cuando lleg el 0 2 el equipo nunca se desesper y fue algo importante ya que siguieron con la misma din mica con la misma intensidad y la labor del portero jonathan orozco fue fundamental sobretodo en el primer tiempo en donde sac una de christian riveros
7168374 hay veces que uno quisiera concretar las oportunidades que genera pero sabemos que no es as muchas veces hay que ser pacientes en el futbol algunas veces te suceder que vas ganando y al final te empatan pero la misma m stica de este equipo debe de prevalecer tenemos argumentos para tener buenos resultados estamos defendiendo mucho mejor y con el paso del tiempo no debemos de dejar de obtener los resultados y de mantener el funcionamiento
7168375 no creo que pese el cansancio terminaron bastante bien ninguno tuvo un ritmo de juego impresionante y ninguno sufri ninguna molestia menos los que jugaron 90 minutos sta fue una actuaci n redonda sobretodo por la actuaci n de todo el equipo nos da confianza ma ana entrenaremos para preparar el partido del pr ximo martes

7168386 was concerned with the impact that hunters lobbying activities might have on his expected campaign for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination
7168387 biden told lotito that in light of these concerns his brother had asked him to seek lotitos assistance in finding employment for hunter in a non lobbying capacity
7168388 this lawsuit has nothing to do with joe biden and there is absolutely no truth to those allegations
7168389 it is a business dispute between former partners the suit is baseless
7168390 there was a concern that hunter bidens role as a lobbyist would have an impact on the senators proposed presidential run
7168391 thats what james biden told mr lotito was it true who knows there is no allegation the senator was involved in any of these events

7168438 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights
7168439 i hope your sleep was not as disturbed as it has been of late

7168441 do you think we could go to town and get a coffee pot today
7168442 i know that when in rome you should do as the romans do but when in england i still need coffee
7168443 helloooo i heard your niece had come to visit for the summer i brought a fruit basket to welcome her to the neighborhood
7168444 i saw her in the garden yesterday she looks perfectly normal what is she some kind of demon
7168445 we have decided we want to continue with the show we enjoy it too much to stop altogether
7168446 it wont happen straight away because were still mourning humphrey
7168447 we had thousands of emails when humph died saying do please continue
7168448 im sure stephen would be good hes very funny and hes excellent on qi
7168449 we all had our favourites but mine would be a woman because then she couldnt be compared to humph
7168450 humph had big shoes to fill and i wouldnt do it
7168451 nietzsche said that life was a choice between suffering and boredom he never said anything about having to put up with both at the same time
7168452 theres this assumption that men and women come into divorce on equal footing and thats just not the case
7168453 those trained in the psychological sciences know that it is possible to devise research methodology to obtain desired results
7168454 the divorce revolution the unexpected social and economic consequences for women and children in america
7168455 weitzemans distorted figures are a puerile falsehood which is not made less absurd by repetition amneus 1990
7168456 however this was not an innocent computer error the computer did what it was supposed to do the investigator staged the result the thought that vast policy changes can come from such incompetence is nothing less than mind boggling
7168457 this has been one of the most widely quoted statistics in recent history
7168458 i dont think theres any defence for sport shooters anymore its a hobby that creates danger to others
7168459 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights
7168460 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights
7168461 i am sorry but i dont see a long term future with you and i cant see you anymore
7168462 stealing their ideas in broad daylight but its all good coz the words are different
7168463 the implication for people who are searching for these sentence collections is that there is an ideal set of sentences and if you drill those in your head youll know japanese but unless im missing something khatzumoto didnt have sentence collections he collected sentences from everything he saw and read in japanese 2 10 000 sentences was a natural product of what he did not the purpose
7168464 this is central to the method methods discussed on this site the target language is no longer something you do it is something you are its practically the air you breathe there is no spoon im sure there are more efficient effective ways out there but i havent really seen them yet
7168465 the only reason l c gets paid more than anyone else is because she demanded in her original contract that no one could ever get paid more than her
7168466 i definitely want to get something bad on the road big enough for all my friends and to scare all the cars away from me im a good driver but its everyone else that im worried about
7168467 chrysler is poised to offer in its 2009 models a new entertainment option for the children wi fi and internet connectivity the problem is that the entire car becomes a hotspot the signals wont be confined to the nintendos in the rear seat front seat occupants will be able to stay online too bad idea as drivers we have done poorly resisting the temptation to move our eyes away from the road to check e mail or send text messages with our cellphones now add laptops
7168468 we have already bought saakashvili spiked running shoes similar to those worn by the jamaican sprinter who won the olympic 100 meters we will also buy him 365 neckties so that he will have enough to chew on every day of the year
7168469 partizan fans once killed a fifteen year old red star supporter he was sitting in the stadium and they fired flares at his chest those monsters killed the boy they observe no limits
7168470 a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in group when the members strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action
7168471 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7168472 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7168473 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7168474 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7168475 its time for government to stop regulating the american people
7168476 and time for the american people to start regulating their government
7168477 his campaign convinced me that people would respond to the message of personal freedom
7168478 a man who thinks carefully about the governments impact on the lives and freedoms of everyday citizens
7168479 im going to wage as vigorous a campaign as my resources will allow
7168480 thats why im making the establishment of sunday bus service into newark one of my issues
7168481 weve built a strong foundation today for communicating our message of personal freedom and limited government
7168482 from this point forward we need to be a strong presence in policy debates at every level
7168483 libertarians across the state and across the nation will have to depend heavily on new media
7168484 libertarians in north carolina and texas are proving the power of blogs and meet ups to challenge the major parties
7168485 probably the last quarter is a reflection of the year the inconsistency i suppose and losing another one when youre in front
7168486 tonight we were a fair way in front at three quarter time so its heartbreaking and the double blow that youre out of september
7168487 after tonight after 21 weeks we tend to know that our season will end next week so thats always a very hollow feeling when you get to that point
7168488 and when you are five goals in front at three quarter time and that happens i guess the feeling is a little bit more hollow
7168489 i think weve had a lot of games where weve come from behind
7168490 if we could get some score on the board we were maybe a chance to hit back quickly and we did that and with that we grew confidence and belief and we got a sniff
7168491 if its good for the goose its good for the gander
7168492 if the nrl does anything to keep greg inglis in the game i would expect the same to be done for johnathan thurston
7168493 i think this sort of thing cant revolve around individuals
7168494 melbourne has greg inglis we have karmichael hunt north queensland has johnathan thurston what about those clubs who dont have a superstar they miss out
7168495 all i know is that we trust greg and we dont have an issue with greg until the end of 2010 post that weve just got to work it out
7168496 i dont have an issue with whoever greg associates himself with hes allowed to make choices in life
7168497 but hes got his manager and hes got to deal with his manager and hes got enormous integrity
7168498 it was a fantastic finish its always important to win but to win in this way with the passion and commitment of the players is much better
7168499 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7168500 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7168501 hes got good presence and pace when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7168502 ours is a great rivalry it has been since the league kicked off in 2005
7168503 the two clubs could play marbles against each other and the stakes would still be high
7168504 so there is no doubt they are still smarting from our win even if others put little importance in that match
7168505 we were both missing players that day and we were both under strength in our opening games of the season last week
7168506 but our sydney and central coasts results were good especially sydney who were missing half a dozen players but still managed a draw with melbourne
7168507 they have a great squad and now they are almost back to full strength
7168508 we were under a lot of pressure in that much but we weathered the storm and almost came away with a fantastic result
7168509 well see how he wakes up tomorrow morning but he may be doubtful for sunday
7168510 i guess they say you learn the hard way and today ive learned the hard way
7168511 leaning into the second corner i dont know what happened
7168512 i got hit from behind and was on my head before i knew it someone ran up the back of me and knocked me down
7168513 its definitely pretty frustrating when its outside of your control when its someone trying something maybe a bit silly or getting out of control
7168514 i had a bit of a moment a bit of a scream when i got up and noticed that my back wheel was wrecked that was the end of my lap from there pretty frustrated at that point
7168515 i was definitely a shot for a medal i came into this event ranked no2 in the world and had my nose in front into the first corner but then i dont know what happened it went all pear shaped
7168516 crashes dont happen anywhere near as often as theyve happened here i think everyones just riding out of their heads because its the olympics this is the big race everyones been preparing for so everyones going flat out and thats causing most of the crashes everyones just going stupid
7168517 there are some guys out there that are known for riding aggressively and theyve taken it up another level its racing thats how things go but it wouldve been nice for everyone to have a clean race and everyone stay up and have an eight man race to the line
7168518 all the hype coming into the olympics just put more pressure on us
7168519 we had to go out there and put on a good show hopefully in london in 2012 we can put on an even better show
7168520 ich hoffe die menschen hatten freude an den olympischen spielen vergessen die vergangenheit und schauen nach vorn
7168521 first a designer makes a page attaches an image and theyre done with their part but then i might look at it and realize that it needs a bit more explanation or a link to a wireframe diagram to give context one of our developers might have also mocked up how a menu works and so they stick in a link to that our client might email the link around and then add some comments on the page this kind of collaborative workflow is one of our strengths and it is really important for us to be able to add these various types of content easily
7168522 so will it be with the resurrection of the dead the body that is sown is perishable it is raised imperishable it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body if there is a natural body there is also a spiritual body and just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven
7168523 my life is no longer than the width of my hand an entire lifetime is just a moment to you human existence is but a breath
7168524 the horse is made ready for the day of battle but victory rests with the lord
7168525 now if there is no resurrection what will those do who are baptized for the dead if the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized for them
7168526 how are the dead raised with what kind of body will they come
7168527 we will not all sleep but we will all be changed
7168528 though he slay me yet will i hope in him
7168529 i am the way and the truth and the life 14 no one comes to the father except through me
7168530 how frail is humanity how short is life and how full of trouble like a flower we blossom for a moment and then wither like the shadow of a passing cloud we quickly disappear
7168531 old testament i forgot how much trash talking goes on here in the book of job it occurred to me that all of this bickering back and forth between job and his friends keeps transpiring without satan coming up in their comments at all meaning no one seems to realize that satan is the one who has afflicted job and im wondering if this happens in our lives today as well do we sometimes miss it when satan is literally attacking us do we blame others blame ourselves maybe even blame god when the blame should be directed at the deceiver i think job and his friends could have used michael the archangel to come into the picture here and whoop up on satan like hes doing in this painting below from the year 1518 by the italian artist raphael
7168532 hold your peace with me and let me speak then let come on me what may
7168533 be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the lord
7168534 i will guard my ways lest i sin with my tongue i will restrain my mouth with a muzzle while the wicked are before me
7168535 i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7168536 whereas previously you never had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7168537 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7168538 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7168539 she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging
7168540 it was obvious that the rhino was injured to some degree as it left its forest to come out on the flat terrain of the oil palm plantation
7168541 when we first got there the rhino showed signs of aggression and made mock charges at us but we kept our distance and left leaves and fruits for it to eat as the oil palm environment is not suitable for wildlife

7168547 i was just throwing the ball down the middle of the plate
7168548 any one of those guys could have been up for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
7168549 i try to keep all the quarterbacks behind me healthy
7168550 i felt when i came out of the game pretty good about how i played
7168551 if im going to practice let me play at least a series
7168552 he can still play this game at a high level he made some throws that only he can make we were fortunate on a couple plays that were called back hes definitely going to help the jets this year
7168553 it was good to get a two minute drive at the end of the half
7168554 got a ton of reps in camp he missed a lot of time last year
7168555 weve seen with running backs in preseason not get carries and come out opening day and look pretty good it doesnt have to be pure game reps its reps however you get it
7168556 please do not have anyone of the opposite sex spending the night
7168557 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7168558 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7168559 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7168560 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench
7168561 hes got good presence and pace when that cross came in sometimes its written in the stars
7168562 we are playing catch up now because we have lost this game but we have to cope and bounce back in the next game on wednesday
7168563 we need a top class performance then because today was simply not good enough
7168564 its a disappointment fulham started stronger than us and they were sharper especially in the first half they didnt create many chances if you look at the whole game but they took advantage from a corner
7168565 we tried to come back but we were too nervous in the last 25 minutes we didnt keep calm in and around the box
7168566 we lacked a bit more quality in our passing than normal and if you look at how much possession we had that shows that technical quality is important as well
7168567 fulham have a good midfield and we werent at our best today the passing was not as good as it could be today either and that applied to every area
7168568 we couldnt afford a mistake in a game like this if we had gone to half time 0 0 i believe we would have won the game
7168569 you always regret matches where youre not at your best of course but now we need to bounce back
7168570 i dont really go in for game plans we just set out to enjoy ourselves and to play
7168571 we doubled up when they had the ball in order to squeeze their space
7168572 i am working very hard and some of the things dont happen overnight
7168573 you cant get your endurance and your strength back in a few days i will keep working hard and we will see what happens
7168574 there was a problem with my calf in beijing and i was taking injections to play that tournament
7168575 i had to take the injections so i didnt feel the pain otherwise i wouldnt have been able to go on the court and play
7168576 believe it or not tennis is the most popular sport in serbia
7168577 that was never the case before we didnt have a tradition of producing great tennis players
7168578 now we have the top three in the world it is really amazing a lot of young kids are playing a lot of people are so interested tennis it is a great thing for our country

7168581 the government will protect the oil pipelines and gas valves
7168582 for those who believe that you dont need tradition because you have the bible the christian tradition has sought to say you are not entitled to the beliefs you cherish about such things as the holy trinity without a sense of what you owe to those who worked this out for you

7168588 new yorkers immediately embrace quentin and his witty waspish ways and before long he is being wined and dined by celebrities in every corner of manhattan
7168589 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7168590 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7168591 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7168592 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7168593 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me

7168600 democrats have been are and will continue to be people of faith and this interfaith gathering is proof of that
7168601 work of brotherhood members in america is a kind of grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within and sabotaging its miserable house by their hands and the hands of believers so that it is eliminated and gods religion is made victorious over all other religions
7168602 if muslim americans are to participate in such a critique of american policy however they will only be effective if they do it according to the prophets words in a
7168603 the first duty of muslims in america therefore is to help shape american policies
7168604 theres a prejudgment a collective judgment of muslims and a suspicion that well
7168605 chat participant what can you tell us about the wahhabi sect of islam is it true that this is an extremely right wing sect founded and funded by the saudi royal family and led by osama bin ladin what is the purpose of the wahhabi
7168606 this question has arisen because last week there were a number of newspaper reports that were dealing with this they raised the issue of the role of saudi arabia and the ideology there frankly i think in a way it was a reaction to the attempts of many people to look for the roots of terrorism in misguided foreign policy its not helpful i believe to create another broad category that that becomes the scapegoat for terrorism
7168607 chat participant osama bin laden made a reference that muslims have been living in humiliation for 80 years did he refer to the treaty of sevres in 1920 that dismantled caliphates and sultanates
7168608 mattson yes he is referring to that to the overthrowing of the caliphate which was a plan of european powers for many years
7168609 in response to another question please suggest any comprehensive work of tafseer quranic commentary for us muslim youth she said there are different kinds of tafseers
7168610 islam wishes to destroy all states and governments anywhere on the face of the earth which are opposed to the ideology and programme of islam regardless of the country or the nation which rules it the purpose of islam is to set up a state on the basis of its own ideology and programme regardless of which nation assumes the role of the standard bearer of islam or the rule of which nation is undermined in the process of the establishment of an ideological islamic state it must be evident to you from this discussion that the objective of islamic jihad is to eliminate the rule of an un islamic system and establish in its stead an islamic system of state rule islam does not intend to confine this revolution to a single state or a few countries the aim of islam is to bring about a universal revolution
7168611 islamic jihad does not recognize their right to administer state affairs according to a system which in the view of islam is evil furthermore islamic jihad also refuses to admit their right to continue with such practices under an islamic government which fatally affect the public interest from the viewpoint of islam
7168612 these kinds of statements are really irresponsible because they can lead to violence against ordinary people
7168613 i dont see any difference between that and al qaeda and osama bin laden using islamic theology to justify violence against americans whats interesting is if you compare their statements about what islam is and what muslims believe youll find they are almost identical and i reject both interpretations both the non muslims who are saying that islam justifies violence against christians and jews and the muslims who are saying it certainly these statements have a very unnerving effect especially when they continue when more than one person says it
7168614 as a practicing muslim i believe that there is a core of fundamental beliefs and practices that distinguish authentic islam from deviations
7168615 im convinced that it is not only inaccurate but unhelpful if our major concern is security security of this country this is a term that has very bad resonance in the muslim majority world and makes us feel uncomfortable here
7168616 the products that are coming from the muslim world are not being called islamic products or islamic oil
7168617 i believe that many americans believe that muslim women dont have any rights in islam perhaps they see images of muslim women being oppressed in different parts of the muslim world and believe that that is because of their religion
7168618 one of the popular misconceptions about islam is that women are seen as lesser figures that they dont have rights
7168619 this perception that women in islam are oppressed is based both on misinformation as well as am amplification of certain unfortunate tendencies in some parts of the muslim world
7168620 mattson muslim women have the same legal rights as muslim men the prophet mohammeds wife was a businesswoman in fact he met her working for her as her agent the legal rights of women were enshrined in islamic law however cultural practices in many societies have prevented those rights from being enforced
7168621 chat participant does the taliban place blame upon women for the weakness of men in their society is that why they place such restriction upon them
7168622 mattson the taliban place restrictions on everyone in their society men and women theyve extended their authority over individuals far beyond traditional government in afghanistan
7168623 that can be frustrating i want to also make sure people understand that although american muslims do have a responsibility to clarify their views on terrorism and violence done in the name of islam we dont have control over these situations we dont have some sort of magic power over all muslims in the world
7168624 right wing christians are very risky allies for american jews mattson said because they the christians are really anti semitic they do not like jews and enter into the alliance on the basis of fundamentalist beliefs that it would be desirable for all jews to return to israel she suggested that fundamentalist christians might turn against jews or that there could be backlash from ordinary americans against jewish and fundamentalist christian supporters of israel
7168625 the american government has not criticized sufficiently the brutality of the israeli government believing that it needs to be
7168626 thus it is not permitted for a muslim to maintain a close friendship with a highly intelligent person who engages him or her in stimulating conversation if that person continuously derides the sacred quran 5 57 58 indeed since preserving faith is the highest priority it is important that muslims avoid demoralizing dependence on other faith communities for their protection and material needs clearly there are groups among american christians and jews who are so hostile to muslims that we should not join with them even in shared concerns lest we lend any credibility to their organizations there are many other groups within those communities however who are eager to work respectfully with muslims to further just causes
7168627 we see candidates being asked to prove that they comply with an ever narrower definition of what it means to be a christian forget about being a muslim or a jew

7168675 its time we raise our expectations of cohabitation and our re think our attitudes toward those who decide to live together
7168676 there is a commonly held myth that marriage means you will live happily ever after however there is no similar assumption of cohabitation the mantra of it wont last only serves to bring about a self fulfilling prophecy

7168690 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7168691 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7168692 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7168693 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7168694 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7168695 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7168696 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7168697 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7168698 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7168699 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7168700 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well

7168732 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7168733 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7168734 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7168735 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7168742 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7168743 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7168744 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7168745 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7168796 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7168797 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7168798 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7168799 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7168800 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7168801 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7168802 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7168803 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7168804 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7168805 joe biden is that rare mix for decades hes brought change to washington but washington has not changed him
7168806 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7168807 and the weakness was experience but he really needed someone like joe biden who had been in congress and had been a master in the area of foreign policy to shore up his campaign even for those democrats who may not be excited about the biden obama ticket
7168808 so for the voters out there and the democrats who are disappointed i think they are going to get a chance at the convention where both bill clinton and hillary clinton will have primetime speeches to get excited about the obama biden ticket
7168809 he does bring the gravitas and experience and age to the table which given how much criticism obamas had for lack of experience i think its important that he have that
7168810 i dont think hes the perfect choice but im not sure there is one out there that would be
7168811 i think hes just playing it safe because i think if he would have picked another younger kind of more funky if you will candidate i think that would have really distanced himself with older voters so i think it was a pretty safe bet to go with biden on this one
7168812 its very very different from just being a democrat who is pouting which i obviously am
7168813 my whole mindset has changed so i dont know what is going to happen between now and november i must say i do respect mccain and normally i detest republican candidates i respect what he brings and offers and so im just totally open at this point
7168814 caso pod amos ent o ser levados a pensar em uma de duas coisas a nota de imprensa n o era um pren ncio do arquivamento ou iria demorar algum tempo a tomar se uma decis o dadas as caracter sticas peculiares deste processo e sobretudo o volume de documentos que iria ser

7168818 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7168819 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7168820 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7168821 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza
7168822 a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7168823 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and join me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understood the rising costs confronting working people and will always put their dreams first
7168824 today ive come back to springfield to tell you ive found that leader
7168825 president lincoln once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place and then stand firm
7168826 today in springfield i know my feet are in the right place and im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7168827 still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds
7168828 thats the kind of fighter i want by my side in the months and years to come
7168829 john mccain served our country with extreme courage and i know he wants to do right by america
7168830 but the harsh truth is loud and clear you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7168831 its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7168832 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7168833 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7168834 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7168835 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7168836 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7168837 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7168838 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7168839 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personal to step up in his absence
7168840 bun you wasnt talking to me online so i got off and um i guess your sleeping so if you wanna call me when you wake id like that and i love you and stuff
7168841 a friend your just not as truthfull as you put yourself out to be
7168842 run to be good practice to be better and train to be the best
7168843 those were the nites when a child became this woman
7168844 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7168845 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7168846 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7168847 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7168848 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7168849 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7168850 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7168851 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7168852 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7168853 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7168854 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7168855 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7168856 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7168857 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7168858 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7168859 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7168860 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7168861 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7168862 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7168863 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7168864 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7168865 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7168866 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7168867 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7168868 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7168869 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7168870 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7168871 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7168872 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7168873 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7168874 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7168875 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7168876 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7168877 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7168878 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7168879 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7168880 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7168881 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7168882 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7168883 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7168884 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7168885 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7168886 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7168887 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7168888 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7168889 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7168890 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7168891 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7168892 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7168893 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7168894 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7168895 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7168896 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7168897 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7168898 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7168899 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7168900 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7168901 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7168902 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7168903 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7168904 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7168905 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7168906 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7168907 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7168908 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7168909 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7168910 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7168911 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7168912 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7168913 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7168914 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7168915 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7168916 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7168942 there once was an angel who was kicked out of heaven she was kicked out because she had crossed god so when the man she was watching over died god decided she would take his place on earth
7168943 the man was a very virtuous man ive been hiitting those vocab lists and he of course went to heaven god liked him so much and hated the angel so much that he had man die a young man and come back and fill the spot of the missing angel
7168944 the angel was so vain god thought that he should send her down as a leper or a handicapped person something like that but the dead man who was now the angel couldnt let that happen to anybody so he said he thought it would be better to send the angel down as a beautiful woman
7168945 god thought this was a little too harsh but he liked his new companions enthusiasm so he decided to try it out then to make it completely unbearable he made her immortal which was another one of the dead mans suggestions all of this however was part of the plan
7168946 many many moons go by and of course the dead man has to preside over the angel and be her angel and eventually he starts talking to her i cant remember exactly how it goes but eventually they fall in love and god finds out how the man angel was plotting this all along and sent him back to earth under the same conditions except he was a man if you like her so much you can spend eternity with her the final thing he did was to make them mute so they could only talk to each other and never tell anybody what happened and thats how they lived two lovers in exile for two different reasons

7169108 for 44 years the afc was governed by malaysian leaders without whose help both with ideas and finance the afc would not be where it is today

7169125 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7169126 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7169127 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7169128 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7169129 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7169130 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7169131 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7169132 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7169133 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7169134 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7169135 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7169136 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7169137 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7169138 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7169139 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest

7169145 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7169160 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7169161 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7169162 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7169163 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7169164 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that

7169166 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7169167 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7169168 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7169169 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7169170 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7169171 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground

7169174 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7169175 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7169176 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7169177 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7169178 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7169179 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7169180 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7169181 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7169182 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7169183 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7169184 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7169185 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7169186 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7169187 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7169188 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7169189 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7169190 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7169191 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7169192 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7169193 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7169194 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7169195 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7169196 dos medallas de plata no se consiguen todos los d as
7169197 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo
7169198 quer a hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes
7169199 es la despedida so ada es perfecto estoy en una nube

7169201 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7169202 when he saw queen esther standing in the court he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand
7169203 gt gt reporter lehigh county executive don cunningham knows biden is from delaware and its one of the things he likes most about the senator
7169204 from a pennsylvania perspective i dont think we could have gotten a better selection other than if hillary would have been on the ticket
7169205 he has a lot of respect in the senate a lot of foreign policy experience and i think he makes up for a lot of the ways where obama is perceived in being weak
7169206 i dont get involved in speculation it leads to more speculation most of it is inaccurate im happy to volunteer
7169207 hes somebody whos stood and led on issues of national significance even when it meant making his party mad sometimes he always puts country first
7169208 senator biden shares the same bad ideas senator obama has which is raise taxes which is to have a misguided foreign policy and national security perspective and to basically be saying no to every idea to bring some relief to people who are paying high energy prices
7169209 i think thats a reflection of the fact that the american people are figuring this out that senator mccain is a leader of courage a leader of accomplishment and barack obama has a very thin resume and is not ready to be president
7169210 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7169211 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7169212 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7169213 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7169214 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7169215 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7169216 this is a planning took where all things are going
7169217 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7169218 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7169219 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7169220 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7169221 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7169222 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7169223 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7169224 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7169225 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7169226 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7169227 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7169228 who i used to be but can no longer even recognize
7169229 we owe the success of the first two films to the fans
7169230 and now that were taking the phenomenon to the big screen oct 24 with high school musical 3 we wanted to show them some appreciation with a few surprise visits from their favorite stars
7169231 a thousand fans showed up to watch the first two movies and to be the first to see some new footage from high school musical 3 then we all walk out surprise and the whole place goes crazy
7169232 i looked into his eyes saw his soul and knew he was a good man
7169233 i am offering you your freedom all you have to do is walk off that track alive and win of course
7169234 i definitely wont listen to what simon says he is just so mean i usually always agree with paula and randy
7169235 theyve taken bloodsport to a whole new level in this administration
7169236 theyve taken blood sport to a new level what a quote congressman bob ney thank you for coming on our program and sharing candidly with us
7169237 thats whats wrong with obama folks youre not reaching out to the hillary people
7169238 consumers need to be able to communicate in a safe environment with debt collectors
7169239 debt collectors are required by federal law and have been since 1977 to treat you the same way the wal mart nyse wmt greeter treats you with truth fairness dignity and respect
7169240 this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose
7169241 very very real need for debt collectors to take the publics perception of the industry very seriously
7169242 im just a humble schoolteacher shepherd stay at home mom
7169243 anyone who plays wants to be given a shot and thats what i based my decision on
7169244 when theres a regime change sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesnt
7169245 there are no ill feelings i loved n c state and really enjoyed my time there
7169246 ive been coming here my entire life for family stuff so i know my way around the city
7169247 louisville is a great opportunity and a great situation my parents are ecstatic that im here and thats an understatement
7169248 obviously hunter is the man here this year after that it opens up but therell be competition no doubt about it
7169249 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7169250 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7169251 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7169252 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7169253 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7169254 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7169255 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7169256 connection costs were prohibitively high while the waiting time for fixed lines ran into years
7169257 nothing has been the same since then nigeria has been transformed socially economically and technologically as a result of that decision
7169258 the exponential growth of the last seven years is more than an explosion it is in fact a bang a revolution which has changed our way of doing things businesses communications and security
7169259 the use of short message service sms and calls has cemented
7169260 today market women traders students artisans and even beggars own phones
7169261 i think im where im supposed to be right now
7169262 i wasnt going to get into a war of words i knew what was true i didnt have the power to change what happened
7169263 its not the people who started the shelter we knew the needs of the people we served and the people who helped us
7169264 we just had all that stuff we were always there people knew we were there
7169265 eagle scouts came to do projects childrens groups came to learn about service the community was very involved
7169266 you build relationships with people then they become a part of your organization
7169267 a homeless shelter isnt something that instantly builds a good relationship with the community
7169268 you blend into the community you dont become a thorn in their side
7169269 the need isnt homelessness as much as the community out there that are all alone
7169270 its always amazing how much a smile a conversation makes a difference in a persons day for any of us when youre struggling its really important women particularly like a family atmosphere just to have someone listen to them thats one of the roles we filled former residents could come by and talk
7169271 my dream is a halfway house for single women a shelter in the best sense of the word
7169272 thats why ive kept my role in st vincent de paul you do see people face to face
7169273 im proud of st marys its always been a resource for people we have a reputation in town its a quiet resource in town that doesnt have a gazillion articles in the paper about whats available but its available
7169274 ive been looking for a job but not just a job jobs arent just about money its a piece of who you are
7169275 it does not take a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men
7169276 if ever a time should come when vain and aspiring men shall possess the highest seats in government our country will stand in need of its experienced patriots to prevent its ruin
7169277 the numbers make it impossible of course for anyone other than barack obama to be the nominee
7169278 she galvanized a lot of people in the country behind her candidacy and brought a number of people who hadnt been involved in the process before into the process
7169279 thats a great thing but the reality is that obama is going to be the nominee and hopefully hes going to be the president of the united states come thursday at 9 p m there will be a united democratic party
7169280 im thrilled to have a small part in it its something ive been looking forward to for a long time
7169281 but i think the party is so focused on taking back the white house and putting someone in the corner office thats going to take care of working families i think theyre going to get over it
7169282 its a great opportunity to see this country go in the right direction
7169283 i think that hillary people who supported hillary may feel they want to show their support
7169284 my feeling is obama will be the nominee and i will do everything i can to support him but until that happens i want to do what i can to support my first choice of hillary clinton
7169285 this is part of what we do we let the small d democratic process work through for anybody to say this weakens the democratic party i think its all hogwash i think if anything this will help the party come together and be strong when you think about what we stand for as a country this is it
7169286 it seems like she didnt even make the short list
7169287 obama talks of crossing party lines and bringing unity and i didnt see him do that with hillary and that upsets me at this point i will vote for him but ill do so reluctantly because i would like to see hillary on the ticket
7169288 i was afraid he was going to pick a white guy with gray hair in his 60s
7169289 i hadnt heard but ill tell you this much people do seem to want a change im just not convinced my vote is going to make a difference
7169290 i know he talks a lot but hes had many many many years of experience
7169291 biden might bring in a small percentage of votes but obamas pissah hell make a great president
7169292 i was going to vote for him regardless of who he picked
7169293 were really so thankful to the taxpayers of northborough and southborough
7169294 were integrating technology right into the lesson right into the curriculum
7169295 each classroom is equipped with technology that helps computer assisted instruction
7169296 has the latest in lighting and sound technology making student productions and performances far more professional
7169297 betapa inginnya kami agar bangsa ini mengetahui bahwa mereka lebih kami cintai daripada diri kami sendiri kami berbangga ketika jiwa jiwa kami gugur sebagai penebus bagi kehormatan mereka jika memang tebusan itu yang diperlukan atau menjadi harga bagi tegaknya kejayaan kemuliaan dan terwujudnya cita cita mereka jika memang itu harga yang harus dibayar
7169298 tiada sesuatu yang membuat kami seperti ini selain rasa cinta yang telah mengharu biru hati kami menguasai perasaan kami memeras habis air mata kami dan mencabut rasa ingin tidur dari pelupuk mata kami betapa berat rasa di hati ketika kami menyaksikan bencana yang mencabik cabik bangsa ini sementara kita hanya menyerah pada kehinaan dan pasrah oleh keputusasaan
7169299 kami berjanji dengan sepenuh hati akan berjuang sekuat kuatnya sehormat hormatnya sebagai mahasiswa universitas indonesia bangsa indonesia makhluk allah yang maha kuasa untuk membantu kondisi tanah air ini bangsa ini menjadi lebih baik
7169300 in 2005 mathworks stepped up and offered to give the town 50 000 a year for five years to help develop athletic fields in natick and said they would like to do one in east natick
7169301 they told them they were pleased to hear mathworks wanted to do that and if they would give 250 000 in one lump sum that would be better
7169302 we had a couple of tile factories which contributed lead and shoe factories that produced tannic acid for the leather as well as a rubber company
7169303 we had a mixture of a lot of different waste some household and some industrial which was toxic
7169304 then the number one most polluted site was capped and taken care of so milford moved to number one
7169305 they moved locations and for some reason the plans were lost the landfill became dormant again no one used it it was 22 acres of wasted land
7169306 because it was closed in the early 70s and we didnt resurrect it until the early 90s a lot of the toxicity plateaued
7169307 we didnt expect it to be so low probably because we let it go dormant it probably met its toxic potential in the 80s
7169308 it opened in 1998 or 1999 it was a success story thats for sure
7169309 if you show it to people who dont realize what was there if you didnt tell them it was a landfill and a dump they would never know
7169310 it was considered a historic site it had some historic architectural attributes
7169311 the town was looking for tenants to take over and invest in improvements but it didnt work out because of the type of work that was needed
7169312 the neighbors they are a very close knit community and most of them went to elementary school there any talk about tearing it down was also tearing down their childhood but it had to come down
7169313 the neighborhood went through a mourning process but finally conceded
7169314 it used to contribute to the identity of the park in a negative way now it makes a contribution in a very much positive way
7169315 neighbors are coming out of their houses and walking in the park interacting and getting to know their neighbors i think it has improved the quality of living
7169316 while we were having the ground breaking ceremony the construction company was busy pouring the foundation
7169317 it is going to allow us to have so many more programs and activities for seniors
7169318 right now we are constrained by the size of the current center there is only one activity room where we can only have 40 people in the room at one time
7169319 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7169320 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7169321 an ambassador who starts prejudiced against the country to which he is accredited might just as well pack up and go home
7169322 then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him
7169323 if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him
7169324 however i know the minds of the president the secretary and the department pretty well and that should help to keep a straight course
7169325 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
7169326 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
7169327 mom that is a man and he has long hair
7169328 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you
7169329 these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full
7169330 to salute one greet bid welcome wish well to to receive joyfully used of those who greet one whom they meet in the way a salutation was made not merely by a slight gesture and a few words but generally by embracing and kissing a journey was retarded frequently by saluting
7169331 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it
7169332 but i thought the ball would get through the infield
7169333 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7169334 i told him if hes going to compete hes going to have days like this
7169335 its not the last time its going to happen to him in his life its a good learning experience
7169336 i think the players were nervous in the first inning they were feeling a little pressure
7169337 this is what keeps us on the road 70 of the time
7169338 we see different reactors in different conditions and we know this removal has to be done very fast we dont want to give more time to people who are preparing to steal this material
7169339 that was a big challenge from the security point of view and from the point of view of keeping it secret
7169340 but we had a constant exchange of information with the bulgarian security services
7169341 it looks just like any other barge business as usual on the danube
7169342 we are very concerned about this material we take this threat to be very real the information that we have lets us know we have to act as aggressively as possible to remove this material
7169343 even if you think that there is a one per cent or half per cent chance of there being such a catastrophic event its probably worth taking a lot more precautions than we are at the moment
7169344 if people insist on the same standards for radioactivity we have now we would have to give up large areas of the city people would ultimately have to get used to the risk of going back to a slightly contaminated part of london
7169345 i really dont know why an attack hasnt happened already
7169346 iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
7169347 i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil
7169348 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive
7169349 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting
7169350 windows set up a home and small office network wizard
7169351 we know less about this area than we know about the surface of mars
7169352 nobody has seen what were going to see in this expedition
7169353 this would add knowledge and elements for the conservation of the richest parts of the sea
7169354 have the potential to tell us a lot about how species arise in the oceans and how they move around
7169355 it seems like some seamounts have a lot of endemic species
7169356 we have so few opportunities to get into the water and see what things lie beyond scuba depth
7169357 we may learn more about what we can expect in the future off the coast of california
7169358 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7169359 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere
7169360 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands
7169361 west bengal can either host the worlds costliest political blunder or the worlds cheapest car
7169362 the controller of the sub got the fright of his life
7169363 he was quietly going about his job when this monster came out of nowhere swam across the camera and then was gone into the dark he tried to follow it but it disappeared
7169364 this is an important sighting we cant be 100 per cent sure but it looks like a great white
7169365 theres no reason why it couldnt have travelled here from the coast of the us
7169366 if there was going to be a great white in the north sea it would be likely to be found near a rig
7169367 ex fisherman on the rig are convinced this is a great white no one would dare go in the water
7169368 the sea is warmer around the platforms because we extract oil at a very high temperature
7169369 as time passed we have lost knowledge of the precise location of the temple and anyone entering the temple mount is liable to unwittingly enter the area of the temple and the holy of holies
7169370 entrance to the temple mount and the defilement of the holy of holies is more severe than any of the violations in the torah
7169371 ok so now you are telling me you cant guarantee i will have the internet until friday
7169372 i have to admit its looking better looking better all the time
7169373 people have to accept a lot of whale calves will die in the wild and its not pleasant and there is nothing that can be done
7169374 this isnt a cute and cuddly world and people have to think about the reality of wild animals
7169375 i believe the national parks and wildlife service behaved impeccably
7169376 i dont think we should be moving towards doing things to keep animals alive in cruel circumstances just to make us feel good
7169377 this is actually more like the government acting like a banker as it begins to look at the major consequences of a major failure in the auto industry
7169378 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini

7169382 ive seen photographs of them they are magnificent game fish and anglers dream about catching one
7169383 to find one on the beach in britain is unheard of and ive been told this is the first one recorded in british waters
7169384 we just dont get game fish like this turning up
7169385 i would have loved to have caught it with a rod and line

7169395 baldurs gate ii like its predecessor is played from an isometric perspective the player controls a party of one to six characters the player must create the main character from scratch or import their character from the original baldurs gate the rest of the party must be recruited from within the game world players can by exploiting the games multi player function create more than one character for a party this does not by any means compromise the integrity of the story although secondary characters will not talk or interact in the manner of normal npcs except as far as the rudimentary interaction of combat and spell casting allow
7169396 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7169397 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7169398 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7169399 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7169400 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7169401 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7169402 ill be starting this game off and well see how it goes from there

7169404 i think i could have sent them to the park and they wouldve been happy
7169405 being a freshman is intimidating especially when you grow up in a small town
7169406 its very comforting when they bring you downtown and you experience the culture
7169407 the idea is that were bringing students from the university down to armory square so they get to learn more about the city so they learn about armory square whats available down here

7169428 he is so special that you wonder if he is flesh and blood if horses were made out of concrete and stone he would be made out of something harder he is a great horse with speed and is getting pacier if you look at the way he travels through his races he had a very messy week as he came to england spent a couple of hours here and then flew back he travelled from 5am tuesday morning and didnt get back to ballydoyle until about 3 30pm there was a lot of travelling there and we were afraid to look for a couple of days to see how much weight he had lost i was nervous as i wasnt sure what would happen but it is a credit to those people who made it happen today and it just shows what can happen when people get together he is just one of those very special horses and you can see that yourself he will never win too far which is probably to his advantage if all is well with him the plan will be to go leopardstown with him in two weeks for the irish champion stakes september 6
7169429 i had to wait an extra couple of days for it but it turned out to be a great race he is so solid so genuine and always turns up the same his work is good his temperament is good and when he turns up at the races you can guarantee he is going to put up a performance like that i got a lovely run up the inside and got there sooner than i wanted but i knew that when i asked for maximum effort that he would pull it out for me up the hill

7169467 if we eat mcdonalds hamburgers and potatoes for one thousand years we will become taller our skin will become white and our hair will become blonde
7169468 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7169469 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7169470 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7169471 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7169472 i dont want to criticise those other sports but certainly after every olympics and indeed every time we come round to a funding round there will be serious work done analysing the programs that are in place
7169473 we believe that without investments in soa governance 60 90 of soa related projects will fail to deliver a positive return on investment
7169474 it is not possible to benefit from soa as an approach unless you can effectively leverage and manage soa artifacts not just services themselves but also soa related policies processes and metadata
7169475 true theyre one of the oldest teams in the ncaa and their logo reflects it but its not the best tiger in the world
7169476 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto calif
7169477 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7169478 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and any time you want to test us its ok
7169479 i did project believe with usada where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it
7169480 i want to be absolutely clear we cant guarantee their cleanliness

7169487 i was scheduled to meet with secretary johanns this afternoon but his office called to cancel late yesterday

7169495 you are better off growing your stars than buying them
7169496 top performers resemble comets more than stars once theyre lured to another firm their performance plummets by as much as 20 permanently thats because just 30 of a stars performance stems from individual capabilities 70 derives from resources and qualities specific to the company that developed him such as reputation information technologies leadership training and team chemistry when you hire a star he leaves all that support behind so his performance flags
7169497 grow your stars dont buy them recruit bright people through disciplined hiring practices use training and mentoring to develop them then strive to retain them by helping them broaden their skills publicity recognizing them and easing their work life tension

7169501 its marvellous shes made it to 50 now and shes still going as long as she keeps on doing the shows well keep on coming
7169502 i cant believe that shes only playing in cardiff and london out of everywhere in the uk im really pleased about it its good to have wales recognised
7169503 i think the audience was a bit quiet there was no drive from the crowd
7169504 it should have been more of a stand out performance seeing as it was her first night
7169505 i expected her to say thank you to us considering we came along for the opening night her singing was good but there was no interaction
7169506 madonna was absolutely fantastic but the cardiff crowd completely let her down we enjoyed it to the max though and madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7169507 i think the fans who have been grumbling about the show are the older ones who arent as keen to get into the new songs i thought it was amazing she has such a lot of energy it was a very diverse show with lots of different things going on it started fun and light hearted but then there was the heavy political moment followed by 4 minutes when she says theres only four minutes to save the world which was brilliant

7169532 we have asked the ppp leadership to let us know if it is prepared to restore the judges by monday
7169533 we were unaware about the announcement of the schedule for the presidential election and nomination of mr zardari for the office by his party when we agreed on wednesday as the deadline for restoration of the judiciary to its pre nov 3 position
7169534 it is not too difficult to move a motion for reinstatement of the judges in parliament debate it and carry it the same day if you dont want to do it in 10 minutes take a few hours and issue executive orders after the passage of the resolution in parliament restoring the judges in the evening we have given the ppp a roadmap and are waiting for their response
7169535 according to the islamabad accord between us and the ppp the judges should have been reinstated in 24 hours after the resignation or impeachment of gen retd pervez musharraf but it is unfortunate that this did not happen
7169536 im not a wheeler dealer and im not aware of any other force that has played a role in the resignation of musharraf if we hadnt stood steadfast to our principles and if we had stopped putting pressure on him the general wouldnt have agreed to resign
7169537 we have told the ppp leaders to abide by the agreements especially the islamabad accord that clearly states that the ppp will get its man elected as next president if the 17th amendment is scrapped
7169538 if the controversial amendment stays a non partisan person enjoying respect and confidence of all the four coalition partners will be elected to the office of the president

7169615 our audience would certainly like it if you would share them sir
7169616 sure thing larry boy my advisirs my adversors i think were respensible for the simply terrible way things turned out you see all great men need advisarials in the tegius work a president must stay on top of on a daily almost a minutely basis we great deciders must choose our adversers carefully you see and the thing is well i was absent the day my daddy picked my adviserbs i had a lot of faith in daddy he gave me my first box of fire crachers and it was some time before i had a chance to vit them
7169617 so after you vetted your advisors why did you continue to use them
7169618 lit me say right from the git go im completely innacent of all the reasons my lord and savor accused me of even lucifer agrees with me and he has given me easy chores to do here my favorite chore is putting little teensy weensy bits of frog parts back to their original positions on their slimy little bodies i sure wish i had some more fire crachers
7169619 yes sir george could we get on with our interview
7169620 certainly larry we great deciders always like to set the record straight what was the question
7169621 oh yes i remember yes i was absent that day and

7169623 well sorta i mean i wasnt really in the loop but even i had to keep a straight face when those buildings came crashing down like dropping frog parts off a cliff and then later that day number seven got tired and did the same thing i even had a hell of a time tryin to keep from laffin when i was in that class room reading about goats did you see that look on my face man that was not acting i was tryin to think of something serious to keep from laffin
7169624 are you saying nine eleven was an inside job mr president
7169625 no no it was all outside i even had my very own videos to watch on slow days
7169626 i mean were those buildings collapsed because of previously placed charges of thermite
7169627 gee i never thought of that can thirmites chew through steel we had a thirmite problem once you know how we got rid of em
7169628 no what i mean is was it your advisors who caused nine eleven
7169629 no not all of them i had some of them workin on the iraq invission you see i knew how to deversify and position my advisarials to multi tisk for the impordant job of protecting freedom loving people all over americans
7169630 and were your advisors planning the iraq inversion long before nine eleven
7169631 hey larry boy youre startin to talk like me i wish i woulda hired you as a helper heh heh

7169822 libertarians across the state and across the nation will have to depend heavily on new media
7169823 libertarians in north carolina and texas are proving the power of blogs and meet ups to challenge the major parties
7169824 whats to be gained by expressing our views face to face if one of those faces might be attached to someone whos not all there
7169825 i think the first thing that we do is we have a look at how the funding is being utilised and whether we are getting the maximum bang for every one of those taxpayer dollars
7169826 that means that we need to have a look at the programs that are in place
7169827 are there ways that we can better co operate and make that money go further i think potentially there is
7169828 i think that its time that we have a look at the next steps for our system and that we introduce serious reform
7169829 this is a massive amount of carbon emissions even for a top
7169830 however these emissions will be swamped by those caused by the crowds of concertgoers
7169831 le jour o tu chevaucheras seul le cheval de tes opinions sur les terres arides de la pens e tu auras gagn mon respect
7169832 jsais pas si je sonne comme une chatte en chaleur meeeeow y a plein de chattes dans les ruelles qui se l vent le cul pis y a moi
7169833 maybe hes in the garden next to the mill where german civilians were held or maybe in a quarry
7169834 in memory of the innocent german victims who lost their lives in 1945 in the mill
7169835 in communist propaganda calling germans victims was banned only poles could be victims
7169836 we need to remember all the victims to reveal the hidden truth even if its hard and shameful
7169837 before world war ii we were polish citizens who had been living in poland for generations so wed never voted for hitler and we never asked him to come here
7169838 every german was seen as a nazi occupier and responsible for wartime atrocities
7169839 the guards at the mill were drifters criminals and drunks who had free rein
7169840 at night the guards picked their victims on february 14 1945 it was the turn of my father and another german who somehow survived
7169841 to the end of her days my mother kidded herself hoping my father was still alive somewhere in siberia she thought the poles would never have been able to kill that humble shoemaker whose shoes many of them wore
7169842 the exponential growth has pushed up nigerias mobile telecoms penetration rate from 0 73 percent in 2001 to 32 79 percent in march 2008
7169843 connection costs were prohibitively high while the waiting time for fixed lines ran into years
7169844 nothing has been the same since then nigeria has been transformed socially economically and technologically as a result of that decision
7169845 the exponential growth of the last seven years is more than an explosion it is in fact a bang a revolution which has changed our way of doing things businesses communications and security
7169846 the use of short message service sms and calls has cemented social relations among nigerians
7169847 today market women traders students artisans and even beggars own phones
7169848 a lot of money goes into running of generators to power our equipment and base stations if the power problem can be solved it will go a long way in improving our services
7169849 i didnt eat for a long time not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad
7169850 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front
7169851 state governments have offered land but id like to assert the project will be a reality
7169852 theres a sense of tension violence its not a conducive atmosphere
7169853 whatever be the cost we will move out if the situation so demands
7169854 west bengal can either host the worlds costliest political blunder or the worlds cheapest car
7169855 russias military has changed risk perception around georgia as a transit route
7169856 you had a much weaker russia that was more amenable to an energy dialogue while russia didnt like the existence of a pipeline that bypassed its territory moscow had accepted its existence now were in a situation where moscow sees the situation in zero sum terms a resurgent russia will be less happy to see routes across georgia expanded
7169857 to see the smiles in their faces give all of us instant gratification in knowing that this gesture has gone a lone way
7169858 the leaders of this event do not support what the guy did
7169859 when they were leaving the scene it was under the understanding that perhaps he hadnt shown the best judgment there were a number of people that took offense to the child being naked in the group and subjected to peoples scrutiny
7169860 it sounds like its been a good lesson all around
7169861 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7169862 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7169863 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7169864 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7169865 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7169866 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7169867 kami semua amat sedih dan kami amat ingin memenangi pertandingan untuk memberikan sesuatu kepada mereka ini merupakan kemenangan yang berarti terutama bagi pendukung kami
7169868 saya senang karena bisa mencapai target waktu yang ditetapkan walaupun harus babak belur
7169869 tadi pun sebelum mengiringi saya dia rudy harus dipijit dulu karena salah satu lengannya agak keseleo terkilir
7169870 pemerintah berharap penurunan harga bensin dan solar tersebut akan membantu meringankan konsumen termasuk mengurangi tekanan inflasi

7169872 the case for democracy the power of freedom to overcome tyranny and terror
7169873 well others could come forward just as much as i could the interesting thing was i didnt hesitate
7169874 it will be tough to replace what we had last year
7169875 our schedule is a tough schedule youre looking through the schedule and we could go anywhere from id hope to say at worst 5 5 to at best 9 1 8 2
7169876 our line is what weve got to keep working on
7169877 just for consistency and leadership a little bit as well
7169878 weve got one senior one junior and the rest are sophomores and freshmen
7169879 were young up front were not real strong because we havent had a lot of time in the weight room
7169880 theyre getting better and better so we can only go up from this point
7169881 were just trying to give the guys as many reps as possible and evaluate them and go from there well see how things turn out
7169882 hes going to be tough to replace but we played a few games without him last year
7169883 we went to danville and beat danville without e j itll be by committee theres not going to be one person that will do it
7169884 he doesnt quite have the speed that e j had but he has an understanding of the game
7169885 keri is one of those kids who is an athlete he cares about frankfort high school he cares about his teammates when he steps out on the field we know what were getting each and every day
7169886 weve got to be able to give those guys a crease so they can hit the lane and go if our o line doesnt come together we can have anyone in the backfield and its not going to matter
7169887 he has probably lost 10 or 15 pounds off last years weight so right now hes as quick as ive ever seen him
7169888 when he wants to play and puts his mind to it i dont think anyone in the state can block him
7169889 the kids know how practice is going to run and on game days they know what to expect i think that consistency is a big strength
7169890 the kids are hungry theyve tasted success and they want to continue on with success
7169891 i think every game we were close with henry and spencer and north oldham
7169892 thats something the school needs and were trying to push for that first district championship and then well see where we go from there in the playoffs
7169893 offensively were going to do a lot of things differently
7169894 we took on an aspect of the jet offense there will always be someone who will be in motion that should give quarterback dylan curry a little more time since people will have to honor movement due to our speed in those slot positions
7169895 dylan being a quarterback and running the show we will have to have a better year out of him and just being smart with the ball
7169896 he tries to force a lot of things and tries to make things happen and he just has to do a better job of making the right reads and doing the right things hell be a huge factor this season
7169897 he has a nice set of hands and with us running the jet it also gives us the opportunity to give him the ball on the run
7169898 he is also a lot stronger in the kicking area his field goals will be an advantage for us because if we get inside the 25 or 20 yard line and we get to fourth down i know its going to be three points
7169899 weve worked really hard in the offseason coach adair has come in and helped us it has helped us with our speed i have been working on strength as well were a lot stronger and a lot quicker and things look like they are heading in the right direction
7169900 kay cochran and brooke barber were offensive juggernauts shelby gehlhausen stepped up and kelly hogan played strong on defense
7169901 we did a whole lot better job passing the ball
7169902 even the girls on the side and the ones coming out commented we were making them chase us instead of vice versa and we didnt feel as tired
7169903 we executed a whole lot better and showed a lot of discipline
7169904 keeping our heads up and making the pass on the foot instead of kicking it downfield its our best outing so far
7169905 we have several injuries rachel williams being out certainly hurts us we certainly miss her presence on the field and her leadership
7169906 due to some peoples continuity because of injuries and re injuring things were having a tough time getting motivated right now we were playing better earlier in the season but well work to get back to our goals and expectations and youll see a different team by mid season
7169907 im very pleased with shellees goalkeeping skills and her leadership and im pleased with shanice brown theyre both doing an extremely good job of leading this team
7169908 weve improved every night and thats what we wanted to do this was a good opportunity to get some younger players in and get them some playing time we didnt have a jv game this week and the jv team is getting antsy to play
7169909 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7169910 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7169911 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7169912 my crooked parking company locked me out of my account its clear that theyre closing my account because they owe me 10 500 usd in click revenues for my newly registered hot domain veryveryveryslipperysnakesandweasels info i know the traffic was valid because i clicked on the ads myself what can i do
7169913 help my domains were stolen i sold 6 three letter dot coms to a buyer with an account at anon petit fi as agreed i transferred the domains to him but he never wired me the money if there are any attorneys online i would appreciate a week or two of free legal services
7169914 i bought a two letter dot com from some guy on the internet after wiring him the money he never transferred the domain i cant prove that he even owned the domain since it has a private domain registration any suggestions
7169915 my domain registrar is a crook its true that a huge number of fortune 500 corporations trust them with their intellectual property but i cant believe that they have the audacity to charge more than 1 what it costs them to process domains through the registry sure they deserve to make a profit but 50 cents per domain per year should be plenty to operate their servers and pay expenses
7169916 dot siberia the next big tld get in on the ground floor by registering your virtual piece of the tundra there wont be a sunrise period because the sun wont rise until next summer
7169917 thankfully weve still got another week weve just got to work together a little better not just with the run but against the pass and play off of each other better
7169918 also studying the opponent a lot more wouldnt hurt either so well see
7169919 he should be so proud as the country is of him
7169920 1924 was the last diving gold medal good on him but good on the whole australian team fantastic achievement for 46 medals this is just great
7169921 a couple of years ago or a year i was thinking ok yeah beijings going to be good if i make the team ill be stoked
7169922 now im a gold and bronze medallist im ecstatic so im looking forward to london and i cant wait to see what i get then
7169923 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world
7169924 but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7169925 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world and together we shared the excitement and drama of the games
7169926 we are first and foremost an organisation devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose
7169927 placing sport at the service of mankind and leveraging olympic values to promote better understanding between people nations and religions stands at the core of our mission
7169928 i dont think just throwing bucket loads of money will necessarily get a result i think you have to have a look at the infrastructure
7169929 the queensland state governments given us wonderful infrastructure here in terms of facilities
7169930 as long as you put a team out on the field everybody has a chance and we had a chance today and so did sally and so did steve and so did the walkers
7169931 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7169932 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
7169933 it is one thing to be passionate about the game that is being played or your kid that is running around but its quite the other thing for that behaviour to go towards the physical level whether it be verbal or physical abuse
7169934 photographers who got fired when they tried this doing portraits at sears
7169935 it was obvious that the rhino was injured to some degree as it left its forest to come out on the flat terrain of the oil palm plantation
7169936 when we first got there the rhino showed signs of aggression and made mock charges at us but we kept our distance and left leaves and fruits for it to eat as the oil palm
7169937 no country thinks of putting these principles into practice but somehow they seem to be worth fighting for
7169938 the greatest evil connected with these rival armaments is that they destroy the strongest motives for peace
7169939 citizens who desire peace can indulge in no greater folly than that which is summed up in the phrase the best way to preserve peace is to prepare for war governments have made the war only the peoples can make an unarmed peace
7169940 there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accomplish our overthrow our destruction should it come at all will be from another quarter from the inattention of the people to the concerns of their government from their carelessness and negligence i must confess that i do apprehend some danger i fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their public servants and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct that in this way they may be made the dupes of designing men and become the instruments of their own undoing
7169941 what a shame another deranged violent right wing prick kicks the bucket
7169942 and why do right wingers lie so damn much like all the time
7169943 bellowing about rhodes is typical right wing bulls t distraction tactic
7169944 welcome to media matters correcting right wing lies one lie at a time
7169945 neo nazis endorsed bush cheney delay hastert now endorse mccain
7169946 big lies the right wing propaganda machine amp how it distorts the truth

7169948 millions of rightys eat the gun americas collective iq jumps 100 points
7169949 what a shame that i live too far to go take long satisfying piss on the grave of this disgraceful lying evil vicious sociopathic right wing prick and overall piece of shit what a fucking disgrace of a human being
7169950 san juan pd is running traffic control the road will be closed until further notice
7169951 i talked to him when he was in the locker room in the training room
7169952 obviously he was down its unfortunate when any injury occurs but hopefully it is nothing serious and he will not miss any time
7169953 it looked like he was turning the corner and just kind of took an awkward step
7169954 the turf is hard and playing at that speed on that edge you can tweak things
7169955 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7169956 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personal to step up in his absence
7169957 theyre kind of surprised that ive been playing with it up to this point
7169958 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it
7169959 its a thousand different options at this point and im just trying to make the best one
7169960 im just trying to make the best decision possible for the team and for my career
7169961 right now in talking to him his mind set is hes doing everything he can to get ready for carolina our opener
7169962 he just wants to get a little bit more information on his knee
7169963 we will rationalise the indica portfolio by correcting some overlapping price points
7169964 we expect to sell more cars with the new generation of indica
7169965 nos imposs vel saber com seguran a se deus existe ou n o existe por isso s nos resta apostar se apostarmos que deus n o existe e ele existir adeus vida eterna al dana o se apostarmos que deus existe e ele n o existir n o faz a menor diferen a ficamos num zero a zero metaf sico
7169966 di sana saya bertemu dengan mereka yang kini sudah berusia 60 tahunan bahkan lebih tua dari itu yang ketika holocaust terjadi mereka masih usia anak anak dan merekalah yang menyelamatkan yahudi yahudi itu
7169967 saya bahagia dan bangga bisa menunjukkan kisah ini pada dunia
7169968 albania adalah satu satunya wilayah pendudukan nazi yang memberikan perlindungan pada orang orang yahudi
7169969 saya ingat sebagian dari mereka bilang tidak ada besa tanpa quran
7169970 saya pernah bertanya pada mereka mengapa anda melakukan ini semua apa yang diajarkan quran sehingga anda melakukan ini mereka cuma tersenyum dan sebagian mereka menjawab kami menyelamatkan hidup orang lain supaya bisa masuk surga
7169971 ini merupakan sejarah yang penting di mana ribuan yahudi telah diselamatkan oleh muslim albania
7169972 kalau anda melihat foto foto dan membaca kisah kisahnya tidak diragukan lagi bahwa mereka muslim albania adalah orang orang yang berhati mulia
7169973 jika ada yang melihat foto foto saya khususnya di negara negara barat dan mengatakan bahwa mereka adalah militan dan pendukung kekerasan saya menolak pernyataan itu
7169974 islam tidak seperti yang ada dalam pikiran orang orang barat
7169975 if i build onto your house i cant leave you anything of value that you could sell
7169976 after i thought about it for a little while i realized that i didnt really want to live right on top of you after all
7169977 i have no money do you have any that youd be willing to spend on my family
7169978 its one of those unaccountable things but good for the esprit de corps
7169979 design and treatment of commercial and industrial buildings and sites developments should be such as to fit in with neighborhood uses for instance commercial establishments located in small commercial islands in residential areas should be set back from the property line in suitable relationship with residential buildings such a requirement appears in the proposed zoning by law in larger commercial districts and the central business district buildings can be grouped to advantage the result of such integration is much more pleasing than rows of individual shops shops may be grouped around an open area in which children can play safely while their mothers shop such developments offer off street parking space easy access for pedestrians safe and convenient shopping and opportunities for attractive landscaping
7169980 the nearest public school is simply too far away youd be riding a bus in darkness over bad roads twice a day its too much of a risk not to mention a hardship i for one do not want to be making bologna sandwiches at 4 oclock in the morning
7169981 how will i ever meet anybody my own age its like were living on an ice shelf near the south pole except we dont even have penguins
7169982 its the best we can do right now maybe next year our lives will change
7169983 if you were fishing you might sit for hours before you got a bite
7169984 its a grueling job if he serves eight years hed be 80 and thats a little bit old
7169985 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7169986 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7169987 we made the final three in a competition where they dont give out silver and bronze medals
7169988 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7169989 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience
7169990 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7169991 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7169992 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency
7169993 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7169994 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7169995 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor
7169996 we feel like its a bit of a disguise pick hes trying to disguise hes the most inexperienced candidate in the modern era
7169997 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
7169998 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7169999 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
