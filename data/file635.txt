6350004 r ather than acting to restrict arms exports the guidelines against which arms export licence applications are assessed are vague and interpreted in such a way as to facilitate exports
6350005 the pro export stance of successive uk governments the close relationship they have with the arms industry and the emphasis on military power as an indicator of prestige on the world stage must all be challenged as they form the parameters within which licensing occurs

6350014 the chinese police documents obtained by reporters without borders show that the police were indeed ordered to let foreign journalists work but they were also ordered to investigate the chinese who told them embarrassing things
6350015 the recent arrests of chinese who wanted to stage demonstrations or express themselves during the olympic games were examples of this desire on the part of the authorities to target their own citizens rather than the thousands of foreign journalists

6350031 offenders like glitter can and should be chaperoned while being deported back to the uk where they can be properly monitored it is disappointing this latest development was not anticipated and proper arrangements put in place to make this work

6350033 we are one of the biggest trusts in the country and as we have seen on many other occasions this format involves comparing our trust with much smaller ones so it is very artificial and doesnt allow for a meaningful comparison at any level
6350034 last year cancelled operations represented only a small fraction just over 1 per cent of nearly 100 000 planned procedures carried out at our hospitals
6350035 any cancellation for non clinical reasons is regrettable and is only approved by a senior manager when all options to avoid it have been explored
6350036 we recognise there is room for improvement and we are working hard to further reduce the number of cancellations
6350037 having an operation cancelled can cause huge distress for patients and their families its simply unacceptable that these figures are so high and that the government is spinning the official statistics to try to hide them

6350042 the fact that we will partner one another through a professionally guided series of steps to get to a result is something that is unique amongst branding consultancies and that mirrors the way we behave as an organisation

6350059 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course

6350087 even our heidi who is older only has a few pairs theres no point buying loads because kids grow so quickly at that age
6350088 they try and set you up its a jerk move asking who you wants to leave
6350089 if people hold grudges thats their decision and i accept that

6350093 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6350094 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6350095 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6350096 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6350097 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6350098 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in

6350144 jesus shocked the established authorities by being a friend to all not only to the destitute and hungry but also to those rich extortioners the tax collectors whom all decent people ostracized the shocking thing was not that he sided with the poor against the rich but that he met everyone equally with the same unlimited mercy and the same unconditioned demand for total loyalty if we look at the end of his earthly ministry at the cross it is clear that jesus was rejected by all rich and poor rulers and people alike before the cross of jesus there are no innocent parties the cross is not for some and against others it is the place where all are guilty and all are forgiven

6350357 mio padre ha preso spunto dalla mia tessera di giovane comunista per sostenere che mia madre non in grado di badare a me perch i comunisti sono un gruppo di persone che portano i figli su una brutta strada
6350358 dovrei stare con mio padre ma dopo unaggressione che ho subito ho deciso di andare da mia madre
6350359 lui non fa altro di associare i comunisti detto in tono dispregiativo sempre con droga spinelli alcol insomma una vita sbandata sregolata da non seguire mentre invece io mi trovo bene con il mio gruppo le nostre idee da quando io sono cresciuto sono cambiate io frequento un liceo che ha idee di sinistra invece lui detesta i comunisti
6350360 a seguito di queste continue insinuazioni mi madre mi ha portato in un centro medico dove sono stato sottoposto al drug test ho fatto il test per dimostrare che non facevo uso di droghe con il risultato davanti mio padre ha continuato a dire che io mi drogo e che il test era stato falsificato questo purtroppo un punto fermo sul quale lui crede di potersi appoggiare per vincere a modo suo questa guerra

6350399 in the last day or so the market has begun to question the fundamentals of the recent us dollar recovery he said
6350400 we have seen particular focus on rumours and innuendo about us investment banking
6350401 i still stand by the view interest rate differentials are less us dollar supportive he said
6350402 it is striking what different patterns in eye blinks emerged for liars and truth tellers
6350403 liars must need to make up their stories and must monitor their fabrication so that they are plausible and adhere to everything the observer knows or might find out
6350404 liars must remember their earlier statements so that they appear consistent when re telling their story and know what they told to whom liars will be more inclined than truth tellers to monitor and control their demeanour so they will appear honest
6350405 was a kind of safety valve like a release of energy after the tension of lying
6350406 thanks teacher and while i am writing you i want to mention that one of the reasons i sometimes dont write back is that i cant find the article anymore
6350407 these two books are much more insightful and informative than thomas friedmans tomes representing globalization in cryptic terms
6350408 over all im optimistic but i feel that were walking the knives edge here
6350409 bill yes i have come to think of china that way
6350410 kevin i agree with teacher that bullying is not working for russia just because they are invading and getting away with it for the moment they are turning the whole world against them for their overreaction
6350411 teacher i agree with you the world is fraught with danger and it is going to stay that way yet the positive is there and i dont think it gets talked about enough and i do think in the long term that is the trend
6350412 dellasumbrella i thought about what you are saying tonight watching mccain and obama at saddleback church
6350413 im gonna keep quiet right now but i think you are wrong for a number of reasons lets leave it at im eyore on this and your tigger
6350414 raven exactly and on most questions confronting us what to do in georgia is a perfect example or what we were arguing about on whether to drill or not
6350415 dogone it why are you making things so difficult for me mccains line was way over the top and the whole situation in that part of the world shows how impotent threats do more harm than good
6350416 bill and freeport yes these things are all true more or less anyway but the remarkable thing is the progress bringing 400 million and even if it is only 300 million people out of poverty over 30 years is an historical first and yes there are 600 million or more to go
6350417 nb i hope everyone is out reading those books and not hooked into corsi do something to stir more comment like some excessive exuberance about globalization
6350418 my eyes are always bigger than my stomach when it comes to books i have a house full of books that i barely get started before i go on to the next but im interested in looking at zakarias
6350419 its better to be more thoughtful and recognize that too often it is easier politically to just give a specific answer when in fact life is full of uncertainties and doubts and new situations arise all the time

6350435 if the business case of terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board incoming group managing director of public policy and communications david quilty said through a spokesman
6350436 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6350437 like any equity player you cant be a shareholder in a company unless you own some shares if we win the bid they will then have the option of coming on board
6350438 i think the roll out would start some time in the first half of next year the earlier the better
6350439 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards
6350440 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
6350441 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
6350442 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
6350443 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
6350444 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
6350445 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
6350446 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
6350447 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
6350448 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
6350449 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
6350450 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
6350451 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
6350452 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
6350453 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

6350469 i have spoken with sporting director predrag mijatovic and with president ramon calderon and they have said to me that robinho has to stay that he cant leave so we cant do anything because he is in contract for two more years at real madrid

6350471 so i have to say that until 31st august everything is possible
6350472 until the transfer window is closed i cant say where robinho will play this season

6350475 weve only just started i think making the first tentative steps to see whats possible
6350476 the thing that i think has gone wrong in this debate is that the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade

6350495 despite macroeconomic uncertainties we expect higher commodity prices to hold we anticipate a very strong performance from the group in the second half of 2008
6350496 although we achieved a good control of costs in the first half we expect cost pressures to prevail through the second half of 2008 and into 2009
6350497 we are lowering our third quarter estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets
6350498 even under the potentially more stringent rating agency guidelines related to the amount of preferred securities in the capital mix we anticipate that lehman can absorb over 3 billion of after tax losses without adding more common equity

6350563 ik schrijf aan een boek over web operations management dit is een methodiek die bestaat uit vier elementen die belangrijk zijn voor het beheren van webomgevingen strategie governance realisatie and meting
6350564 het web governance raamwerk framework is een structuur die wordt bewerkstelligd door het hoger management het geeft aan wie de leiding heeft over de webomgevingen dus wie de uiteindelijke beslissingen neemt over budgetten bemensing en de uit te voeren activiteiten een webbeleid is belangrijk omdat dit een reeks van organisatorische richtlijnen biedt die moeten worden opgevolgd bij het cre ren van webomgevingen beleidsrichtlijnen vormen ook een brug tussen aan de ene kant de strategische doelstellingen van een organisatie en aan de andere kant het dagelijkse werk aan en de ontwikkeling van webomgevingen in die organisatie webrichtlijnen voorkomen dat organisaties in de problemen komen door zeker te stellen dat al hun webomgevingen voldoen aan alle relevante externe wetten en richtlijnen die de organisatie van buitenaf worden opgelegd dit laatste is meer en meer aan de orde
6350565 webstandaarden zijn uiterst belangrijk omdat zij tactische richtlijnen bieden voor het ontwikkelen van webcontent en webapplicaties standaarden manifesteren zich in documenten als het redactiehandboek applicatieontwikkelinsprocessen en procedures etc veel organisaties hebben een soort van webstandaarden opgesteld en denken dat ze daarmee hun governance op orde hebben maar zoals ik hiervoor al aantoonde dit is maar een klein deel van de totale benodigde governance structuur
6350566 het implementeren van webgovernance in een organisatie is ingewikkeld vaak hebben topmanagers geen idee wat er allemaal komt kijken bij het maken van een website en webspecialisten zijn vaak onvolwassen managers die websites blijven zien als een reeks van technische implementatieprojecten dus het vereist een verandering in het denken enige opleiding en een vrij intensieve communicatie door alle lagen van de organisatie heen om webgovernance van de grond te krijgen dat gaat niet over n nacht ijs
6350567 het meest belangrijke dat een webspecialist kan doen is stoppen met praten over webprojecten en in plaats daarvan het gesprek met het management aangaan over strategie leg topmanagers uit dat de organisatie risico loopt door het ontbreken van krachtige webprocedures inclusief webgovernance leg ook uit hoe de organisatie dankzij deze governance structuur zal profiteren van de verbeterde aanwezigheid op het internet van de constante vraag kan ik meer geld voor tools krijgen krijgen de meeste managers allergische reacties vertel ze in plaats daarvan welk strategisch voordeel ze krijgen voor hun geld
6350568 1 vind een sponsor uit het hoger management die het belang van een governance raamwerk inziet en die de verantwoordelijkheid voor alle webactiviteiten duidelijk helpt beleggen in de organisatie 2 begrijp dat de webomgevingen transactionele en communicatieve voertuigen zijn voor de gehele organisatie en dat sommige onderdelen ervan centraal kunnen en moeten worden belegd maar dat hiervoor een grote hoeveelheid van organisatiebrede richtlijnen in het leven moeten worden gebracht 3 erken dat het realiseren van governance zijn tijd nodig heeft misschien duurt het wel jaren eer een organisatie zover is het is namelijk een proces maar hoe eerder je start hoe beter

6350644 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6350645 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6350646 ik geef je 500 euro als je nu die handdoek laat vallen
6350647 zei hij nog iets over de 500 euro die hij meschuldig is
6350648 ik wil naar de malediven heerlijk in de zon op het strand liggen
6350649 en ik wil naar new york met een portefeuille vol geld om te winkelen
6350650 ik wil die twee terug op kantoor na de lunch
6350651 ha kraai wat zit je lekker te niksen denk je dat ik ook zo kan luieren
6350652 gaat voort en zoek omhoog en verder omhoog want daar is de glorie
6350653 nou ja kijk zoals het jou heel waarschijnlijk opgevallen is er zijn hier geen vrouwen in deze barak staat onze kameel en wanneer een van onze mannen het niet meer kan uithouden
6350654 voor vandaag is hij volgeboekt maar morgen is hij nog vrij
6350655 ik begrijp dat de nood hoog was maar kon je niet met de kameel naar de dichtstbijzijnde stad naar de vrouwen rijden zoals alle anderen hier doen
6350656 his ask from that meeting was to be left alone for the rest of the day
6350657 do you know the name of the person who got all asky in that meeting
6350658 he did have that deep baritone voice and he couldnt have been nicer
6350659 sie k nnen es tun und sie werden es tun bitte vertrauen sie ihnen
6350660 dokter ik heb hier een dikke bult die pijn doet
6350661 man die dikke bult is je lever wat drink je
6350662 en una tragedia de la magnitud de este tipo pedimos la m xima celeridad porque hay que dar una respuesta mucho m s r pida que en otras circunstancias a todos los afectados y a la sociedad
6350663 no me atrevo a decir eso creo que ha sido un accidente y tendremos que ver las causas para exigir responsabilidades
6350664 nee dat hoeft niet in de supermarkt staat nu een computer die sneller en goedkoper een diagnose kan stellen
6350665 je plaats enkel een urinestaal in die computer en die vertelt je onmiddellijk wat er met jou aan de hand is en hoe je het kunt verhelpen en dat maar voor een eurootje
6350666 vermutlich weil sie besser mit den extremen bedingungen dort hoher druck kein sauerstoff geringes n hrstoffangebot zurecht kommen
6350667 auf der grundlage unserer auf unabh ngigen messungen resultierenden absch tzungen kommen wir auf rund 90 milliarden tonnen kohlenstoff ein betrag der genau in diesem bereich liegt
6350668 damit bringen wir vermutlich ein bisschen mehr licht in das dunkel der tiefen biosph re
6350669 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6350670 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool
6350671 i think that a major field of application will be to help manufacturers abide by the european union law concerning the ban of dog and cat fur trade next year
6350672 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6350673 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6350674 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6350675 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin
6350676 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6350677 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6350678 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6350679 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6350680 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6350681 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6350682 es wird vermutet dass eine strukturierte anordnung der gene einer strukturierung des k rpers vorausgegangen ist

6350684 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
6350685 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have sustained enormous damage in terms of manpower
6350686 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
6350687 there was no attack on the airport in tbilisi it was a factory that produces combat airplanes
6350688 the whole world is starting to understand that what is happening here will determine the future of this region the future price of crude oil the future of central asia and the future of nato
6350689 every bomb that falls over our heads is an attack on democracy on the european union and on america
6350690 theres an array of plants with an array of different chemicals and toxins that they attack from tobacco to coal to benzene which you find in paints to formaldehyde
6350691 in eduarda england the aspidistra plant which is also known as a cast iron plant was used to filter coal and tobacco smoke out of the house
6350692 to this day it is a wonderful house plant because it grows with almost no direct light and is a very easy to care for
6350693 the lady palm is also known as rhapis excelsa its a low light palm and it has the ability to remove ammonia from the air which means if you spend the day cleaning the house this is a wonderful plant to have
6350694 other great plants that are easily recognized are the great leaf ivy both the green leave and variegated the snake plant will live in absolute darkness and only takes watering once a week
6350695 the philodendron and of course the dracaena marginata will both work to filter the air and improve the quality of the life in your homes
6350696 in 48 hours three ships have been attacked and hijacked by armed pirates it is coming to a very dangerous stage
6350697 we urge the united nations and the international community to take serious action to stop this menace
6350698 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies
6350699 my labs next task was finding the origin of lagarzoles biological activity
6350700 in jouw plaats zal ik een ander vrij moeten laten je mag zelf kiezen wiens plaats je inneemt en je kan kiezen uit drie deuren
6350701 lijkt me geen goed plan want ik heb een zwakker schouder
6350702 we are lowering our third quarter estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets
6350703 even under the potentially more stringent rating agency guidelines related to the amount of preferred securities in the capital mix we anticipate that lehman can absorb over 3 billion of after tax losses without adding more common equity
6350704 it will be a bad day for the democracy and country if judges are not reinstated
6350705 ik zou anders te laat geweest zijn op mijn werk edelachtbare
6350706 with musharraf out its not clear whether or not the open door jewish organisational leaders have had in islamabad is in danger of slamming shut
6350707 its a big plus for the jewish people to have an opening to the worlds only nuclear armed muslim country
6350708 i hope the idea of being open to american jews doesnt get thrown out with musharraf
6350709 i know everybody wants to talk about musharraf the individual who was at the centre of the stage for the past few years and everyone wonders what happens next
6350710 if you thought of it conceptually as every child having a personal tutor thats what were aiming for
6350711 most kids may be tested on 20 spelling words while a couple in the class may be studying only 10
6350712 you can actually focus on what you need to know rather than tracking down someone to answer your questions
6350713 even at the best schools you used to be limited by how much you could pack into one little library
6350714 now if you have web access youre only limited by whats known
6350715 the kids who dont have computers at home will be at such a fundamental disadvantage it will be as if they dont have a pen or paper
6350716 dr is nog n ding het ligt naast je bord
6350717 would i be trying to finish this if there wasnt a in it for me
6350718 ach je weet hoe dat gaat h drug drug drug
6350719 kom op man het was maar een geintje hoor ik bestel wel even een nieuwe voor je
6350720 its like going to one town and seeing only one building
6350721 hmmm wheres your health and nutrition center and he replies hmmm i dont know thats all we have here
6350722 many people who are going through the early stages of the awakening process are no longer certain what their outer purpose is what drives the world no longer drives them seeing the madness of our civilization so clearly they may feel somewhat alienated from the culture around them some feel that they inhabit a land between two worlds they are no longer run by the ego yet the arising awareness has not yet become fully integrated into their lives inner and outer purpose have not merged
6350723 youre half of the flesh and blood that makes me whoo oo ooole yeah yeah yeah yeah
6350724 our findings suggest that msc therapy could become a useful treatment for inflammatory bowel disease
6350725 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
6350726 damn thats an embarrassing song that you just sang your heart out to
6350727 i thought only black people sang that kind of music
6350728 okay i have 10 minutes ill quickly read blogs while i can but i cant type because i am reading while i am eating
6350729 hey that was cool what you were saying on your blog the other day
6350730 why is that my only purpose for existence does the fact that im just a good human being mean nothing anymore must i also bear fruit of my loins
6350731 no those are my kids the one with the feline acne and the yeast infection in his ears and the other one who will eat his own feces if you let him yep those be my babies
6350732 previsiblemente la semana que viene ser el momento de tener ya un recuerdo manifestado de una forma participada por los
6350733 creo que debe ser la semana que viene porque hay que dar tiempo a los magn ficos equipos de forenses que han realizado las autopsias y a la polic a cient fica de la guardia civil que est identificando los cad veres adem s l gicamente luego sus familias querr n tener sus entierros o incineraciones y cuando todo eso haya finalizado creo que la semana que viene ser el momento de ese recuerdo

6350735 haremos una concentraci n sin palabras s lo con un sentimiento quedo pero que sonar muy fuerte la solidaridad del pueblo de madrid con todas las v ctimas de la cat strofe
6350736 nos ha parecido que hay muchos madrile os que quieren ver identificado ese sentimiento que todos compartimos cuando nos enteramos de la noticia de la tragedia
6350737 we gaan in gesprek met de horeca als er goede alternatieven zijn wordt de kans op incidenten kleiner
6350738 i think deep down rob isnt looking for ways to improve aros or the aros looking for ways to improve the aros community its plain from his blog that he enjoys the camaraderie and collaboration found in most linux projects
6350739 la pierre a peu despoir d tre autre chose quune pierre et pourtant en collaborant elle sassemble pour construire un temple
6350740 thaksin is a criminal who ran away from the justice system he does not deserve to carry a thai diplomatic passport
6350741 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6350742 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6350743 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6350744 will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution
6350745 furthermore the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6350746 they studied it and scheduled the signing and then they cancel everything what is that
6350747 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6350748 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6350749 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6350750 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6350751 when im at volleyball all im thinking about is volleyball im here trying to coach and trying to win im trying to compartmentalize all other parts of my life right now
6350752 but the guys kept grinding and we picked it up in the fourth and fifth sets
6350753 usain bolt is a super human being the world has never seen anything like him
6350754 not only is he physically the best in the world but he has supreme confidence in himself and he knows how to deliver
6350755 jamaican athletes are the best jamaica is the sprint factory of the world
6350756 i want to appeal to jamaica to stop the crime
6350757 je veux a t elle confi que toutes les poitrines puissent se retrouver dans ce que je fais les grosses les petites les rondes les poires
6350758 whatever happens on the weekend im going to be in the history book
6350759 there are some teams that won a world championship and disappeared
6350760 thats our big merit weve won the world championship weve won the european championship and now we need to represent spanish basketball well at the olympics
6350761 its a bittersweet moment because with the youth of our team the next olympics would have been the big one
6350762 for the group of young ladies on this team and how young they are sticking around four years would have been an easy call sticking around for eight there are going to be some people who are going to have to think about it
6350763 im going to certainly ask them to for the sport and because they are great athletes and theyre not done yet at the same time its an absolute shame softball is not in
6350764 im not sure what happened with those last few games
6350765 i know were a better team than those last few games showed
6350766 its a great team sport its fast paced theres a lot of action i just think its a great sport
6350767 youre talking to someone to who the world championships was it
6350768 i happened to sneak in and get into the first olympics but the main thing is the players who are playing now never knew that they never knew what it was like to work up to the world championships with that being your olympic games
6350769 theres going to have to be some mentoring and coaching and teaching and the bottom line is when it comes to the next world championship its going to be these same teams
6350770 i made a lot of stupid mistakes in that race a lot of mental errors and i might have paid the price it was a bad race i let my guard down you cant let you guard down at the olympics thats that i couldnt respond when they came up on me i kicked a little too early i paid the price
6350771 i have been waiting for this day for a long time
6350772 its a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before
6350773 russia will have to point its warheads at ukrainian territory
6350774 i am committed to achieving a credible deterrent with the lowest possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with our national security needs
6350775 my goal is to move quickly to reduce nuclear forces
6350776 the weak are not loved and not heard they are insulted and when we have nuclear parity they will talk to us in a different way
6350777 the spectre of disaster is always present in the high hurdles
6350778 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
6350779 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
6350780 we are a communist society with the people the leaders and owners but basic citizens rights cannot even be realized today how sad it is
6350781 the way things are is the opposite of the people oriented ideology of the country when it was founded
6350782 i wouldnt say were peaking but were playing pretty good basketball
6350783 the one thing weve relied on is our defence one thing we need to work on is our free throws
6350784 when we play defence the way we can it gives us a good chance to win
6350785 we know well have to play a perfect game and thats probably not enough theyll have to play badly
6350786 we want to play the defending champs its all about challenges and obviously we welcome all comers
6350787 we know what a great team greece is but argentina is the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6350788 the key to wednesday nights game was to stick with it knowing that they were going to come out early and give us all they had
6350789 we had to stick with what we do and thats pressure defensively and run our offence where everybody gets involved
6350790 just keep playing the way we have been playing keep our composure when teams come out early and give us everything theyve got
6350791 im just taking everything step by step enjoying the ride
6350792 my friends in the car business so hes going to help me
6350793 ive been looking at some aston martins and some maseratis it would be pretty sweet to get an old school aston martin some of the old school james bond ones that would be sick
6350794 i dont see him being an actor i think hell just want to be a celebrity whatever that means
6350795 i was thinking twice should i do something i have a regret a little bit
6350796 the federations reasoning was they didnt see the head shots on instant replay
6350797 i can only laugh about it cry or laugh id rather laugh its not the first time ive been ripped off quite bad
6350798 people were talking about taking taekwondo away from the olympics because it was so bad
6350799 judges are human too now because of what happened to canada oh i feel bad for canada so now the judges heart is more towards canada its happened before
6350800 im not gonna be a sore loser and be like well i quit
6350801 but its hard right now its hard to take it i didnt get the medal this time but eventually there will be a day that ill be able to get it i have faith in that
6350802 it got very sophisticated because obviously the battery doesnt last long and then we had to look at circuits and interrupters we have been working on it around two months with a crack team
6350803 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6350804 ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high
6350805 fourth place man walking home with a third place medal he said this before realizing hed actually been elevated to silver
6350806 im going to take the medal home its mine but im always going to know that i finished fourth because someone was disqualified
6350807 it has to be three steps in a row he objected
6350808 they didnt show me step on the line though they would have told me already right im not worried
6350809 in our training we never forgot for a single moment how hard our competition was said ermakova
6350810 no one serves up a gold medal on a silver platter
6350811 its important people understand how hard work it is said ermakova
6350812 people should actually be put under water and try to do what we do i think it is one of the hardest working sports around
6350813 there is art in this sport we perform to music and music is art but after all my muscles were completely numb so i dont know how they could kick us out of the olympic games
6350814 from the reaction of the crowd i knew we had won bronze
6350815 we are aware there is distance between us and the stronger duets conceded jiang wenwen
6350816 but we are improving step by step we cried but we dont feel regret
6350817 we are very happy with our swim said boudreau gagnon
6350818 we were expecting russia to perform at a very high level and swimming right after them got us a bit more nervous
6350819 we realize now that moving up in the rankings is very doable boudreau gagnon said
6350820 he was a loyal moderate party man who did his best to pull things together after the cultural revolution
6350821 but hua lacked both the vision and the courage that deng showed
6350822 i was told that he gave identical notes to other top leaders
6350823 this meant that a clean break could not be made with the bad old days of the cultural revolution
6350824 in early october of that year came the happy day when i heard jiang qiangs dulcet tones
6350825 coming apparently from a cell right across the little courtyard from mine
6350826 i knew that if she was in i was on my way out
6350827 usually before a race im focused entirely on the starting line but ill usually take the opportunity to ask the people i love but who are no longer with us to maybe give me a little hand in the competition
6350828 its a bit of a superstition i ask them to help me make sure everything goes well
6350829 we were partners in crime i was very close to him it was probably the most difficult time in my life
6350830 i think theres a time for everything and so i told myself that after the beijing games that i would stop
6350831 im studying towards a career that im anxious to begin and if i want to have a family life its not really possible to do that as a competitive cyclist you have to make choices in life and i think im at that point
6350832 thats it i dont want to be 40 years old and still be on my bike
6350833 ive always been very very close to my mother even from a very young age and even today she still travels with me often to competitions
6350834 shes my mother but shes also one of my best friends so we have a very close relationship
6350835 what they taught me to be is a genuine authentic person to have dreams and believe in achieving them to never quit and to always stay determined
6350836 so the qualities i have and the faults are all things they taught me
6350837 what i like the most is the adrenaline rush that i get from doing the sport its the feelings and sensations you get from the sport im also someone who really likes to train so its easy to feed this passion
6350838 its dear to my heart ive been dreaming about this for years
6350839 anyone who wants to cast aspersions on our drug testing program i can say just one thing they can go to hell
6350840 ive raced with him four times this year and ive never seen him definitely pushing the tape before
6350841 that was the best record still out there and he wanted it hes a phenom thats what we call a phenom im just happy to be a part of history
6350842 ive written history it means a lot to me it means a lot to jamaica i know everybodys out dancing in the street
6350843 i dont compare myself to michael johnson im trying to be just me
6350844 the 100 is a product of me not wanting to run the 400
6350845 he is a mentor he is a coach he is a second father to me
6350846 no no no no no no no no no no no no theres no limit no no
6350847 wenn wir drei stunden um den staffelsee gehen kommen wir erst richtig in fahrt
6350848 die schrecklichen folgen des sed regimes d rfen nicht in vergessenheit geraten
6350849 failed messiah follows the controversy closely with links to related press articles and judicial records
6350850 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6350851 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6350852 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6350853 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6350854 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6350855 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what stands for and believes in
6350856 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment
6350857 once again we have seen a welcome increase in results at gcse despite the lowest entry for five years this is evidence of the hard work of the students and the continued dedication of their teachers
6350858 the core subjects at gcse continue to dominate and still account for almost half of the full course entry
6350859 some young people are focusing their efforts on fewer gcses that has been a trend that has been happening since 2003
6350860 weve seen growth slow over the last year and in terms of like for like sales growth is now in negative territory
6350861 consumer confidence is going in the same direction and the only things up are unemployment number of claimants and repossessions
6350862 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6350863 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6350864 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6350865 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6350866 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6350867 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6350868 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6350869 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6350870 i love deadlines i like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by

6350875 everything that happens is determined by what happened before our actions are inevitable consequences of the events leading up to the action
6350876 the western conception of free will seems bound up with our sense of moral responsibility
6350877 no i dont have the power to do that im no leader that often state
6350878 allow us to include the financial indicators of electric companies in the gazprom consolidated account and avoid the minor mistakes that arise when making a number of technical decisions without conciliating them with the central office of the monopoly
6350879 tablesample always returns an approximate number of rows because of the way it samples data the required percentage is the number of data pages sql server retreves in full to fulfill your tablesample request the number of rows returned by tablesample will often be slightly less or greater than the specified amount
6350880 anytime you use dynamic sql make sure that you take precautions against sql injection that is malicious sql code being inserted into your sql statements in this instance were using the quotename function to quote the column names being dynamically generated to help avoid sql injection problems
6350881 the ansi sql 2003 standard includes a merge statement that performs the same function as the upsert type of sp the prerelease versions of sql server 2005 included the merge statement though it was well publicized during the prerelease period the merge statement was unceremoniously dropped from the production version we can only hope that microsoft brings it back sometime in the near future
6350882 the music the people the sea everything about the bluegrass festival was all so magical that i felt i had stepped into another world

6350884 this mass in time with ninoys 25th death anniversary is to appeal to the aquinos especially to noynoy to forgive and pardon the remaining soldiers in the aquino galman murders

6350886 would surely heed the cry of the 12 remaining soldiers
6350887 he was a lawyer well aware of the problems of the justice system during the marcos era if ninoy were alive he will surely be most concerned about the serious flaws and abuses in the justice system
6350888 the innocent criminals in jail the ninoy 12 included continue to languish because the real culprits want them to suffer
6350889 in fact celebrated cases like the aquino galman case and the abadilla 5 are luckier than most because they merit some attention while the unknowns have none
6350890 we cannot allow anyone whether innocent or guilty to suffer for the crimes of those who evade justice because of the power and influence they wield over it
6350891 i heed ninoys advice to criticize in order to be free because only when we criticize can we be free twenty five years may seem far too short a punishment for heinous crimes but what can we say if innocent men languish this long or even longer
6350892 somehow we can say that part of the truth has died with them both the innocent and guilty are repositories of truth unfortunately in our defective justice system both guilty and innocent rot and die in jail before the truth is revealed

6350904 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6350905 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6350906 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6350907 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore

6350937 i remember writing my first rap on the train with my big brother cashes showing me the ropes certifying my swag
6350938 i was beginning to see an end to what seemed like an inevitable struggle
6350939 i realized early on i wasnt going to be a career criminal
6350940 i took to my pen full fledged without looking back

6350944 its unbelievable and its so special to do it with this fella simpson
6350945 i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt
6350946 im just shocked to do this after this week and this year weve had is unbelievable
6350947 there are no words to describe how happy we are
6350948 since last year everything focused on this week weve worked really hard for the last 12 months
6350949 we had to pull it back from the brink it was a tough race and we just did enough

6350954 that has been a trend that has been happening since 2003
6350955 the gcse results are most significant for the pupils themselves
6350956 we have got to be reasonable because it takes time to turn schools around
6350957 their perseverance and hard work must not be forgotten in the scramble to analyse the number of students achieving at the highest levels
6350958 we are here to bury anwars political career we are here to make history to ensure our nations future is free and safe from him
6350959 i am afraid that if anwar is elected as a mp and forms a new federal government our country will be sold to the united states i want to know where his election fund comes from
6350960 i dont understand why he would take a coffee boy a volunteer without a fixed salary overseas i never take my coffee boy abroad
6350961 however my friend told me that if anwar took him overseas then the coffee made by saiful must be kaw kaw strong
6350962 regardless if you are malay chinese or indian we help all malaysians
6350963 if you go to other places in the region the chinese had to change their names and couldnt go to chinese schools but here we let everyone practise their culture

6350966 the exterior wall is ideal for shelves and theres space for a vacuum cleaner and equipment you dont want to look at
6350967 the wood will add warmth to the foyer after that all it needs is a handsome runner and a stylish chandelier
6350968 this should create a nice conversation area and leave the bathroom wall free for a thin tv over a set of shelves for books and memorabilia

6350970 there are also big chairs on the market now that pull out for a single bed
6350971 were trying to adapt to the market demands and keep most of the price points between 290 and 399 000
6350972 theyre willing to forego space in the front of the house the formal living and dining room are largely unused in order to have more space in the rear of the home
6350973 they want a larger kitchen that flows into that comfortable open concept living area they love having a breakfast area and an island with stools
6350974 that section badly needs a boost so see what you can do
6350975 what they do when they feed on the growing points they cause the very young leaves to become all twisted up
6350976 its hot sunny and dry and thats a good condition for the mealy bugs to develop
6350977 it just seems like the plumeria trees in waimanalo just not blooming as much as they used to
6350978 we did build our house around that plumeria tree it would be nice to see it not struggling
6350979 the sprays that control it are too expensive for the average home owner
6350980 i think the toronto market has matured to a point where its able to accept projects of this nature
6350981 its a natural evolution instead of taking a green field and building a huge tower
6350982 we wanted to make sure they didnt enter as if they were going into a subway
6350983 the glazed elevator makes arriving more of an event than coming into a windowless corridor you have multiple level terraces and a courtyard
6350984 the garage strikes a chord with males even executive ones like these
6350985 a lot of my clients say this is the only place they have thats solely theirs it may be the least finished space in the house but once the concrete floor is sealed its highly usable space
6350986 july 1st so he and his friends could hang out watching baseball on the new 65 inch plasma
6350987 with the reduction of attics the garage is now the place to put your familys things
6350988 and most of the time cars sit outside because the garage is so crammed with things
6350989 its like walking through an intimate garden to your front door
6350990 any kind of focal point like sculpture or planters or furniture will do the trick
6350991 but just have one and make it really nice and good quality because you will notice right away
6350992 you could grow plants or vines or leave it as a stand alone architectural detail
6350993 only consistent thing on the exterior is the mortar no ones changed the colour of that in a gazillion years
6350994 we expect to sustain the current level of exports but growth will be at zero not the two to three per cent we realised in the previous years
6350995 the sales figures are going down last year the dutch industry grew by four per cent over 2007 in the first half of this year growth has been flat
6350996 i dont expect there will be room for expansion of kenyan exports
6350997 with widespread talk of a recession in the uk it is reasonable to expect a degree of negative growth in our own sales
6350998 and retailers are in a way deterring sales of fairtrade and organic products by pushing low pricing its crucial for them to retain their customers
6350999 six months ago it was all about sustainability and fairtrade products now theres a real shift to price and value
6351000 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers but this is more likely to be a plateau than a reverse
6351001 the downturn has only just started in the uk its certainly going to get worse over the next half
6351002 weve had a consumer boom in the uk for the last 15 years with people constantly looking to trade up but their confidence was being boosted by the rising housing market thats not there now and i think well see a lot more trading down all high end products will come under pressure
6351003 we are committed to generating year on year growth for both our kenyan partners and our customer base and feel we offer a product which will remain attractive to the uk public during the anticipated economic slowdown
6351004 you cannot pull that off you look like a ragged assed you know what
6351005 when you walk ouf of this house you are representing the family and that includes how you are dressed and how you behave not only do you represent the family but you repreent the race just be careful out there

6351007 estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile
6351008 la imagen que m s fuerza me provoca es la coherencia que siempre sostuvo entre el discurso y la pr ctica el hecho de poder constatar que hay sujetos en la historia del pa s que se han entregado a la lucha por los intereses de los m s postergados es decir los trabajadores con una pr ctica congruente y una fuerte dosis de autoridad moral el hecho de colocarse ante la existencia de aspectos que trascienden a la simple coyuntura eso me llam profundamente la atenci n y hablo de trascendente no en un sentido idealista de la sociedad y la historia sino con aquella mirada que considera a los hombres y mujeres en los campos del conocimiento las ciencias el arte la pol tica esto para m es relevante toda vez que hoy estamos carentes de personalidades que le den a su vida un valor superior respecto de las cosas estrictamente materiales
6351009 yo era muy joven cuando conoc a clotario como estudiante y como muchacho clotario siempre estuvo dispuesto a apoyar aquellas expresiones estudiantiles y a los j venes trabajadores que estaban no vinculados a las formas tradicionales de hacer pol tica o a los partidos tradicionales siempre clotario goz de un reconocimiento efectivo de aquellos comprometidos con las transformaciones sociales aut nticas y con la lucha extra amente tambi n tuvo una animadversi n hacia aquellos sectores ligados a los partidos en especial a los partidos estalinistas en este marco se gener mi conocimiento a la figura de clotario como un joven conocido m s para l uno mira a los grandes personajes de la historia y procura emular algunas conductas clotario es una de esas personalidades importantes que dan luz sobre aspectos oscuros que la sociedad chilena transita hoy y que se observan cuando se escucha a ciertos dirigentes pol ticos que todo lo hacen en funci n de la negociaci n del objetivo pol tico coyuntural olvidando siempre a los m s postergados es decir a los seres humanos
6351010 hay una enorme inspiraci n que proviene de luis emilio recabarren para m es la figura m s importante del pensamiento pol tico social de los trabajadores chilenos a n no existe otra persona que pueda superarlo en consecuencia tica e incluso en el campo de la educaci n de los asalariados recabarren fue el gran profesor de los trabajadores y sindicalistas chilenos y explor much simas disciplinas en los amaneceres del siglo xx cre un peri dico desarroll el teatro la formaci n permanente desgraciadamente la historia se ha encargado de ocultar su nombre peligroso para los poderosos porque tras l hay toda una vivencia una propuesta una doctrina que deber a ser asumida por los trabajadores pero que lamentablemente es repetida s lo formalmente recabarren y clotario son las dos figuras emblem ticas del movimiento obrero chileno
6351011 actualmente existe muy poca vinculaci n entre las aspiraciones de los trabajadores por mejorar sus condiciones materiales respecto del escenario en el que lo hacen
6351012 tenemos a una enorme cantidad de chilenos que no son personas humanas se puede ser ciudadano en un estado dominado fuertemente por el consumo por un sistema capitalista ultra aqu s lo se puede ser ciudadano si se es sujeto de cr dito es decir un sujeto capaz de adquirir bienes y servicios a trav s de un salario estable en tiempos donde reina la flexibilidad laboral y superior a los 300 mil pesos mensuales 600 d lares que corresponde pr cticamente a un 30 de los trabajadores chilenos bajo este sistema la mayor a est compuesta por sujetos condenados a vivir la marginalidad a reproducir la pobreza en sus hijos a trav s de la educaci n la salud la previsi n social etc y un individuo as es infeliz entonces si la vida es tan precaria y s lo puede ofrecer infelicidad los trabajadores deben dotarse de dirigentes que comprendan este fen meno que lo socialicen que lo discutan que sean capaces tanto de explicar esta infamia como de proponer y practicar la transformaci n profunda de la sociedad y ello se logra por medio de una revoluci n social que coloque en el centro a la persona humana al sujeto que hace posible la riqueza esta discusi n fue planteada hace 150 a os y contin a plenamente vigente
6351013 lo que estamos observando es una destrucci n de las fuerzas productivas una concentraci n cada vez m s grosera del capital y el poder y eso naturalmente est lejos de la democracia lo anterior no ofrece soluciones a los grandes problemas de la humanidad incluso la situaci n es contradictoria a lo que dicen los propios te ricos de la sociedad capitalista a los grandes liberales que combaten el oligopolio el monopolio y promueven la competencia sin embargo en chile vemos una condensaci n econ mica cada vez mayor y la nica forma de revertir el actual estado de cosas es radicalmente de manera revolucionaria innovadora
6351014 eso habla de que estamos viviendo una etapa tr gica el sistema capitalista ni siquiera ha podido garantizar a las sociedades actuales un m nimo decoro las b sicas necesidades fundamentales que en otros per odos se hab an logrado de alguna manera producto de las conquistas de los trabajadores el hecho de que luego de la ltima post guerra mundial el sistema garantizara un elemental r gimen de seguridad social en algunas reas hoy est en tela de juicio el capitalismo para su mantenimiento requiere arrancar todas las conquistas logradas por los trabajadores dejando a fuertes contingentes de asalariados convertidos en mano de obra barata en esta estrategia se encuentra el embate del capital contra los convenios contenidos en la organizaci n internacional del trabajo oit considerando que para algunos durante los 50 del siglo pasado la oit era una mera expresi n de una concepci n tripartita conservadora ahora la oit para el capital es una instituci n contenedora de ciertos derechos y por tanto busca aniquilarla plantea que no se justifica ya porque el capitalismo ha concluido que la relaci n trabajo capital tiene que resolverse bipartitamente es decir el estado y los organismos internacionales deben renunciar a cautelar principios y derechos fundamentales esto explica entre otras variables el bajo porcentaje de la negociaci n colectiva en chile menos de un 9 porque la negociaci n colectiva como se alaba la socialdemocracia y muchos sindicalistas que repet an que el mejor reasignador de recursos era la negociaci n colectiva actualmente est n ocultando este planteamiento porque si la negociaci n colectiva era la mejor forma de reasignar recursos pero hoy pr cticamente no existe qui n reasigna los recursos s lo el mercado entonces ahora la tropa de antiguos pseudo socialistas quedaron desarmados
6351015 el derecho laboral surgi hace casi 150 a os a trav s de grandes juristas franceses italianos europeos que entendieron que la asimetr a entre el capital y el trabajo demandaba la formulaci n jur dica de una concepci n que equiparara al trabajador frente al empleador para negociar esta cuesti n la comprendieron en su momento hasta las miradas m s reaccionarias de la historia y por ello producto de la revoluci n bolchevique y el terror al comunismo la socialdemocracia europea los partidos capitalistas norteamericanos entendieron bien el contexto y generaron reg menes que cautelaron los derechos m nimos de la gente as garantizaron trabajo estable seguros de desempleo decentes salud gratuita y pensi n pero todo ello ahora mismo se est acabando
6351016 la huelga de 30 d as de las trabajadoras y trabajadores del santander banefe fue altamente educativa para quienes participamos en el proceso la ense anza m s grande est ligada a que los trabajadores hicieron su propia experiencia y pudieron sacar conclusiones importantes una de ellas es que la unidad sigue siendo una de las herramientas fundamentales para los intereses de los asalariados esta consigna tan lugar com n fue refrendada por los hechos no es suficiente claro est se requiere tambi n de representantes sindicales honestos dispuestos a dirigir sobre la base y el ejercicio de la m s amplia democracia y potente comunicaci n los conflictos nosotros tuvimos 14 asambleas en un mes de huelga ello genera un buen debate convicci n elevaci n de la moral y limita la incertidumbre que es un arma que suelen usar los empresarios
6351017 el conflicto tambi n revel elementos que no siempre est n presentes en la lucha sindical tradicional si bien el holding santander logr mediante sus poderosos recursos que la huelga y sus razones sufrieran un cerco comunicacional m s que importante afortunadamente nosotros explotamos la veta de la comunicaci n internacional ello signific que muchas organizaciones sindicales internacionales solidarizaran con nuestra lucha y el sistema financiero hoy es vulnerable a este fen meno el negocio de los bancos es la especulaci n entonces los grandes inversionistas al ver un conflicto que comienza a cobrar notoriedad p blica internacional presionan sobre la instituci n financiera en problemas
6351018 el conflicto hay que proporcionarlo pero sin duda fue importante para los trabajadores bancarios chilenos considerando que el grupo santander es el m s grande de iberoam rica para nosotros el hecho nos plantea grandes desaf os y conclusiones nos dice que con unidad convicci n voluntad y comunicaci n permanente es posible comenzar a derribar ciertos mitos basados en el poder o de las grandes corporaciones financieras supuestamente impenetrables por otra parte el conflicto tambi n descubri la certeza de que los trabajadores estamos solos somos la mayor a pero estamos solos de organizaciones sindicales reales una muestra fue la pr cticamente nula solidaridad de la central unitaria de trabajadores cut a pesar de todos los esfuerzos que se hicieron por tratar de comunicarse con la direcci n m xima de la cut para que prestara alg n tipo de apoyo por qu porque las personas que est n en la direcci n de la cut son ignorantes respecto de las nuevas luchas de este pa s y de las nuevas formas de la organizaci n capitalista del trabajo y por otra parte tampoco son capaces de dar cuenta de la realidad de temas tan relevantes como la educaci n en chile por ejemplo lamentablemente la cut hoy representa a sectores minoritarios
6351019 la mayor conmoci n que provoc la huelga de santander banefe y que activ sin buscarla por esos medios la solidaridad internacional fueron los grados de violencia que cobr el conflicto el primer d a fuimos detenidos casi 90 compa eros fue ultrajada una compa era el segundo d a un dirigente nacional fue brutalmente golpeado en el hall del banco durante toda la huelga fuimos seguidos por vigilantes de civil como en los peores tiempos de la dictadura militar ello y m s fue denunciado al gobierno a los parlamentarios a los partidos pol ticos sin embargo de qu nos sirvi cuando hay una complicidad en el hacer y en el silencio de los poderes establecidos y el capital financiero contradictoriamente con lo que podr a pensarse la indiferencia de los representantes del modelo dotaron de una mayor fuerza moral a las trabajadoras y trabajadores en huelga la violencia del capital no nos extra a tanto sino m s bien la pobr sima solidaridad sindical salvando excepciones que recibimos dentro del pa s
6351020 los trabajadores bancarios quedamos en una posici n un poco mejor que antes y adem s el conflicto nos permiti conocer nuestras potencias y limitaciones y una de las fortalezas de la confederaci n es la autonom a y la independencia de clase con las que nos conducimos poco a poco la confederaci n se arma de organizaciones reales de dirigentes que se forman en la lucha y mediante el ejercicio de la democracia y la acci n directa
6351021 la elecci n de la cut es irrelevante no tiene ninguna trascendencia para los trabajadores chilenos a pesar de que existan un par de dirigentes sindicales interesantes que desde hace poco est n tratando desde la cut de instalar un discurso y una pr ctica diferente pero en general lo que hay en la cut es la reproducci n de un ejercicio superado por la historia las elecciones est n organizadas sobre listas que responden a partidos pol ticos que en chile representan una cuota marginal de chilenos hoy es innegable para cualquiera que la gente y sobre todo la juventud no siente ninguna identidad con los partidos tradicionales yo pienso que estamos frente a la bancarrota del sindicalismo tradicional en chile y por eso lo que ocurra en las elecciones de la actual cut no tiene importancia para los intereses genuinos de los trabajadores del pa s lo m s probable es que las cosas queden tal cual est n en las listas hay personas que ni siquiera son dirigentes sindicales
6351022 las necesidades y realidades de los trabajadores transcurren por cauces distintos a las maneras que se expresa y organiza la cut todav a la cut vive en gran medida enfrascada en un modelo de desarrollo existente hasta 1973 pero rest ndole la autoridad moral de los dirigentes de esa poca hoy la cut cay en un pragmatismo exacerbado en el superestructuralismo y es antidemocr tica hasta en la elecci n de sus representantes
6351023 la cut sirve para blanquear las pol ticas del gobierno en t rminos generales funciona como ap ndice del gobierno y por lo tanto puede servir para validar la miseria de ingreso m nimo impuesto a los trabajadores para ello por lo menos siempre tiene prensa
6351024 las relaciones de producci n han variado tanto en chile que la organizaci n de los trabajadores se torna sumamente compleja toda vez por ejemplo que el sector de servicios terciario ha cobrado un vigor notable pero laboran en condiciones extraordinariamente precarias y no cuentan con tradici n de organizaci n hay muchos trabajadores que viven de la parte variable de su salario que son comisionistas trabajadores que se emplean luego de las 6 de la tarde y sus ritmos de funcionamiento son distintos etc todo ello demanda organizaciones diferentes que las tradicionales hoy hay que concentrarse en los trabajadores de los sectores m s dominantes de la econom a servicios comercio telecomunicaciones transporte
6351025 el sindicalismo no puede estar sujeto a los lineamientos jur dicos actuales ordenados por la patronal el sindicalismo desde sus albores ha estado al margen o en los l mites de la legalidad y por tanto ha obligado a que se haga la ley en funci n de sus demandas y luchas y no al rev s las leyes sociales nacieron en el mundo como fruto de las luchas y crecimiento del movimiento sindical organizado las leyes sociales de 1924 ley de la silla protecci n a la maternidad etc fueron consecuencia de las grandes luchas que dio luis emilio recabarren a comienzos del siglo pasado y que obligaron al presidente alessandri a promulgarlas para contener el avance del mundo obrero y por eso en 1931 nace el primer c digo del trabajo no como expresi n de la voluntad de la burgues a de la poca sino como resultado de la lucha de los trabajadores y hoy abrigamos grandes esperanzas toda vez que el promedio de edad de los trabajadores chilenos es mucho menor que el de las actuales dirigencias sindicales
6351026 en el contexto actual que gane la alianza por chile o la concertaci n para los trabajadores no significa ning n cambio significativo seguir a predominando el modelo econ mico actual las instituciones jur dicas no sufrir an grandes transformaciones en consecuencia para los intereses de los trabajadores resulta indiferente votar por pi era o lagos hay que recordar que el legado presidencial de ricardo lagos escobar se resume en el aumento de las inequidades sociales la concentraci n de la riqueza la violencia simb lica del capital sobre el trabajo se agudiz y lo que quedaba de servicios p blicos fue privatizado qu podemos esperar los trabajadores de un nuevo gobierno de la concertaci n o uno de la alianza por chile aqu en el corto plazo hay que construir una alternativa pol tica tal cual los empresarios que representen sus intereses incluso en el parlamento

6351101 my performance had nothing to do with my preparation for the meet but the way the meet was run
6351102 if you watch the event you will see that they made us wait there for an hour why does the competition start at 8 40 p m and we are still jumping at midnight

6351135 despite the best efforts of police the trial powers were ineffective in assisting police to apprehend drug couriers on a sustained basis mr barbour said in a statement today
6351136 i have considerable reservations about whether these or similar powers will ever result in the cost effective detection of person involved in road based drug trafficking
6351137 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said
6351138 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6351139 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6351140 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6351141 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6351142 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6351143 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6351144 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6351145 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6351146 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6351147 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6351148 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6351149 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6351150 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6351151 hes very determined you need to be to stick with it all those trainings demand it and he used to be so shy but he got over that from all those international meetings competitions that he went to
6351152 i would like to see his passport it would very interesting to see what it looks like and his mother or father would always accompany him wherever he went
6351153 all four of my grandchildren in pennsylvania are tetrathlon athletes and the olympic coach approached sam and said that if he added fencing he could qualify
6351154 each person has a roommate and we ate in a cafeteria sam showed us all around the campus and there are all of these athletes running around so very tall
6351155 he has eight hours of training each day and he does all of his college work at the same time i dont know how he does it he is even studying german and russian and wants to be a vet like his dad which is four more years of college
6351156 but he says he has a hard time reading my handwriting even in english
6351157 it was labeled and very scientific and he was only 4 years old at the time but you know he always loved gardening he always had his nose in the ground just like his old oma
6351158 i dont know what else to say about it its unbelievable
6351159 as soon as i could balance a boat i was paddling and ive been paddling ever since reardon recalled
6351160 my dad never pushed me into it he still paddles to this day i did a lot of sports growing up like rugby and lacrosse and kayaking and i kind of just started on my own with full time kayaking
6351161 growing up in the canoe club with all the olympians i thought it was something i really wanted to do especially with my dad going to the olympics as well
6351162 he told me he was in front spot brady reardon said
6351163 for me to come here and race in front spot is pretty cool
6351164 im following in his footsteps i guess its crazy its awesome theres definitely huge support from my parents and thats one of the reasons i can do this today
6351165 we have jim reardons participation medals from the olympics on the wall and theres a picture of him coaching larry cain a gold and silver medallist in canoeing at the 1984 los angeles olympics brady reardon said
6351166 hes got old posters from regattas and stuff all over the house
6351167 now ive got my own posters ive got to refresh the walls with new posters for sure
6351168 im getting tons of hits on my website with people saying congratulations ive got 200 messages this week alone its really nice
6351169 i said sorry i just cant but thank you i do read them all and theyre all really nice
6351170 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6351171 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6351172 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6351173 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6351174 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6351175 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6351176 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6351177 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6351178 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6351179 you never picture yourself coming home with a medal due to a dq
6351180 everytime i look at it im going to be like this medal was given to me
6351181 i guess thats the only reason to speak out isnt it to speak to young people in their impressionable formative years and say something that could help them make sense of their lives
6351182 lessen the sense of alienation and isolation that they might have i think thats something that definitely id be proud of that we could say that there are alternative ways of behaving of living ones life
6351183 its been a pretty exciting morning i couldnt sleep very well but these next few days are really important
6351184 yeah i think thats one thing weve learnt the industrys changed so much in the last year
6351185 you can do whatever you want why not drop an album when its finished instead of sitting on it for six months
6351186 were really proud of it it was one of the first ones we finished
6351187 can you call your guy cause im on the phone
6351188 no ill go and see if hes in there will i
6351189 could you please put a call through to matt tongs room t o n g just tell him that the taxis out the front thank you
6351190 hes coming as a kid i was a big fan of greek mythology those stories and characters have stayed with me but thats it the working titles have stuck you realise six months down the line you cant name it anything else because youre so attached trojan horse was lyrically a very different song at the end of recording but the title was still there to me the song rises and attacks like a trojan horse
6351191 its like a term of yeah an affectionate term nothing to do with stephen biko or the peter gabriel song
6351192 without giving too much away theres a recurrent sound through the song kinda like the wind whistling to me the lyrics are a whole other issue i wouldnt get too mythical until you hear the music itll make sense then

6351205 that bill subversive sharp watch out for him misses nothing a dots connector
6351206 i was like an 8 year old before christmas day
6351207 it was a tearful event at our house last night
6351208 when they put that gold medal around her you just thought about all those hours and all that time and training and watching this girl grow up and what it meant
6351209 its a thrill watching anna grow up at north cape as this skinny little curly haired blond girl that just loved to go sailing all the time to an olympic gold medalist
6351210 we had not won a gold medal for 20 years on team usa sailing and this is just a huge win for everybody that sails around the united states especially on the great lakes
6351211 this is something ive wanted so long and now all the emotions are crowding in on me
6351212 everything has been a whirlwind since i finished racing nearly four hours ago
6351213 as i sit down to write this it feels like the first time ive stopped to draw a breath but the high is still continuing
6351214 i knew i had to pull something out to get back on top
6351215 most of the fleet had gone right in toward the seawall but i got into this line of breeze and headed out to the left along with the two sailors ahead of me who ultimately won the silver and the bronze
6351216 after i rounded in third place i knew i had the gold in my grasp counting the overall points i had going into this race
6351217 someone asked me later how i felt going down the last leg and i can tell you the finish line couldnt arrive soon enough as i got the gun i was so happy and so proud to win for my country
6351218 we have 325 senior members and probably to each one of us it means something a little bit different
6351219 but for north cape its the biggest thing thats ever happened to us
6351220 all those people who have lost their homes now wish that the appraisers that they had appraising their properties came in with the true value so they wouldnt be losing their homes
6351221 wir haben alle leute in peking und ein kerner ist uns diese aktion wert

6351234 together previously and have achieved great popularity together is showing much sadness at this unfortunate event
6351235 sollev il peplo e mostr per intero un luogo del corpo per nulla decente ma iacco un fanciullo era l e si precipit con la mano ridendo sotto il grembo di baub di ci sorrise la dea e si rallegr nel suo animo
6351236 ma pi degli altri il furore delle cavalle sgomenta lamore le conduce oltre il g rgano oltre gli scrosci dellascanio valicano monti e a nuoto traversano fiumi e quando nelle viscere si diffonde il fuoco del desiderio stanno ferme in cima alle rupi la bocca rivolta a zefiro e bevono i sospiri dellaria incredibilmente senza accoppiamento spesso le ingravida il vento
6351237 figlia figlia mia parte di questo corpo fiato dello spirito mio chi me lavrebbe mai detto che con una ventosit avrei dato forma a questa bella faccia chi me lavrebbe detto che leffetto di un colpo di freddo avrebbe generato questo fuoco damore
6351238 ma dopo nove mesi quella scaric una coppia di creature uno maschio laltra femmina che vedevi due tesori di gioielli che accuditi da due fate apparse in quel palazzo furono appesi alle zizze della mamma e una volta che volevano succhiare e non trovavano il capezzolo le afferrarono il dito e tanto succhiarono che le tolsero la lisca per la quale cosa parve che talia si destasse da un gran sonno e vistisi intorno quei bigi diede loro la zizza e li tenne cari come la vita
6351239 ecco infatti che zeus mutatosi in un serpente sinuoso avvolto in amorose spire come uno sposo penetra nei bui recessi della tua camera verginale agitando le mascelle squamose quanto ai dragoni suoi simili che sono di guardia alla porta nel passare li addormenta
6351240 theres a certain trust you have with a company in terms of needing to send confidential information so it can be used in generated reports but its with the obligation that that information is kept secure

6351243 despite the best efforts of police the trial powers were ineffective in assisting police to apprehend drug couriers on a sustained basis mr barbour said in a statement today
6351244 i have considerable reservations about whether these or similar powers will ever result in the cost effective detection of person involved in road based drug trafficking
6351245 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said
6351246 if the business case of terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board incoming group managing director of public policy and communications david quilty said through a spokesman
6351247 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6351248 like any equity player you cant be a shareholder in a company unless you own some shares if we win the bid they will then have the option of coming on board
6351249 i think the roll out would start some time in the first half of next year the earlier the better
6351250 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards

6351270 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6351271 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car

6351324 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 30s it is different in that bolt has a bigger edge than owens in his finals
6351325 bolt in a way if he maintains that in the future will bring a mark like jesse owens
6351326 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6351327 i would love him to show more respect to his competitors he should learn that he should shake hands with competitors
6351328 i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived is catch me if you can you dont do that
6351329 do not forget that he is still young he is a young man bolt will learn that sooner or later he is a great athlete of course
6351330 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6351331 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6351332 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6351333 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6351334 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6351335 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
6351336 i think they are getting there on the top and its going to be extremely difficult to change that
6351337 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
6351338 they have a generation that is already ok and ready for london 2012
6351339 i expect more international athletes got really frightened and scared about using doping
6351340 we are making progress its becoming far more difficult to cheat than it was before
6351341 its not pleasant to think that about 25 kilometers from sochi there is a potential region of instability in abkhazia
6351342 the russians have pledged total security and told us we should not be concerned about that i could only hope these territorial conflicts can be solved as soon possible thats the work of the politicians
6351343 i would expect all of them to be back and more
6351344 i still love the organization but it was just a business move you cant mix personal things with business it was a business decision i accepted that and we moved on
6351345 they gave me an opportunity to play 11 years and take care of my family so i dont have any animosity toward this organization especially the coaching staff because the coaching staff is just like family
6351346 jeff and i talk off and on hes always wanted me to come back
6351347 its good that he feels welcome to come back in the building he knows hes welcome anytime
6351348 its just that growing spurt hes got to go through and hell realize it
6351349 people dont understand this is only his third year vince has a lot to learn he has a lot to improve on and hes willing to do that hes so competitive and he wants to do everything right and it gets to him if he doesnt live up to the fans or the coaches expectations
6351350 i welcome jeremy here for a multitude of different reasons
6351351 one is so we can win a championship i mean how many more years am i going to be able to play a championship is my priority at this point
6351352 and its going to take some pounding off my body so if he can come in and play well and i can go out and play my role and still do it well who knows maybe i can play another five years
6351353 i was encouraged to see him make some tough catches take some hits and get up
6351354 he made some good catches in traffic i think a couple of them gave us a big boost
6351355 early on in my career i wanted to be a receiver because those guys were paid more
6351356 thats the reality of it but truthfully god gave me a different ability and im a run blocking guy ive accepted that
6351357 im not going to run by any cornerbacks but i can be really effective in intermediate routes
6351358 when i first got the news i had to have surgery on my back id say thats one of the key injuries back or neck where guys are like thats it
6351359 we all want to play as long as we can but you definitely want to be able to have a normal life play ball with the kids or whatever so it was definitely something that crossed my mind
6351360 theres not a guy that im more happy for right now than mark campbell
6351361 that really puts a lot of things in perspective when you feel like your career might even be threatened you know a back injury for a tight end whos late in his career mark has worked so hard to fight back from that and he looks as good now as ive ever seen him and ive heard that comment made by several people who knew him as a younger player too hes a big part of the spirit and energy of this team
6351362 i feel good because i know what my role is
6351363 thats why ive played 10 years now because i know what i do best i dont try to be something im not jeremys going to be our guy and im the run blocker
6351364 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a
6351365 i think justice was served for the boy and for his mother
6351366 and the family is relieved that its come to a conclusion and they can move forward the boy is in a safe environment and i hope for the best for him
6351367 every time she tried to get away he beat her
6351368 she had the same type of burns her child had
6351369 we thought that was appropriate under the circumstances and was sufficient to hold him accountable and to punish him for the horrible acts against the child and the mother
6351370 all the people that have stepped into his life really appreciate all the donations
6351371 it will enrich his life and assist him in his life he is pretty much left with nothing but this trust fund

6351376 especially with never really having been in a game with him for an extensive period of time especially this week it was imperative that i get out there get some work done try to see how hes seeing the game how hes going to be viewing the defense and things like that
6351377 he is what that whole group needs to look like that starts with donald driver greg and i think ruvell martin has done a great job adding to that
6351378 not only are they good players smart players but they play every position they give you the ability to match up and create mismatches across the board when you get into multi receiver sets greg is someone well try to utilize even more this year
6351379 with greg back it probably takes a little pressure off because youve got to kind of pick your poison
6351380 you double cover donald well go after greg you double greg well go to donald
6351381 hell be one of the guys that ill evaluate as the game goes on
6351382 chemistry wise were on the same page i think weve worked enough the last two years and in the offseason program but its going to be nice in the flow of the game to be able to look his way a little bit im not worried about chemistry between him and i
6351383 i wasnt a part of it but i am a part of it it wasnt fun to watch and i guarantee it wasnt fun to be a part of you know thats just one of those downs that teams go through and were just glad we went through it in preseason
6351384 when youre dealing with guys that like to run after the catch sometimes that run after the catch gets before the actual catch you get your eyes off the ball that split second before it touches your hand and thats when drops occur but its not something that were not used to doing we drop balls but really dont drop them probably to the extent of what weve been doing lately well correct it i promise you that
6351385 north korea has apparently given up its home field advantage
6351386 the two associations have been discussing this for a long time
6351387 it is not us it is the two national associations who have decided
6351388 this system was established in 1988 and we should not leave this system
6351389 this is to say that in the development of football there are no miracles
6351390 you have to start organizing youth competitions if you are to take home the medals in the high level competitions
6351391 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6351392 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6351393 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6351394 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6351395 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6351396 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6351397 i couldve been to the pro bowl instead of dropping about 10 picks
6351398 i was starting to have a really good season last year then came the injury now im back so i need to have a really good year im anxious to go out there and show the real carlos
6351399 i was khary for a little minute but you guys got me
6351400 absolutely we were last in the world in kickoff returns were emphasizing that
6351401 i dont know that we ever put all of the blocks together that you need to spring one
6351402 its probably a reminder of how good the guy was before
6351403 its not just the returners although thats all that most people ever see
6351404 we need to tighten up we obviously know our numbers have been down and we want to improve on that
6351405 last year we didnt play as well as we could our blocking and other things we could have done better on kickoff returns and things like that so hes stressing those right now

6351479 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6351480 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6351481 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers
6351482 i cant foresee the future but i cant anticipate any further job cuts at this stage
6351483 the recent speculation regarding a change to stamp duty on housing transactions has undoubtedly caused further delay and uncertainty in respect of house purchases
6351484 the overwhelming majority of our lending continues to be in low risk sectors and all of our mortgage advances were fully secured on residential property

6351509 we are currently using openclinica for 11 trials with sites in germany india and brazil and we plan to use it for new studies with sites in the u s as well
6351510 as a small medical device company the professional open source approach behind openclinica makes a lot of sense it allows us to be highly adaptable in how we administer our clinical trials while providing us with high quality professional support in key areas
6351511 openclinica removes many of the constraints that proprietary vendors tend to put on their clients
6351512 openclinica gives the research sponsor much greater latitude in how they implement and support their systems this is becoming increasingly important as research grows in expense and complexity

6351518 its years and years and years of work and sacrifice and dedication along with a lot of these girls weve sweated and bled and weve cried together in the past couple of olympics
6351519 ive been playing with the national team since i was 15 and thats been bred and beaten into my mind you know get a medal in the olympics go for gold but get a medal
6351520 and i think any volleyball player out there sacrificed a good portion of their life to do this and its worth it i would say its worth it even if we didnt make it here just for the experience along the way but its damn worth it now that we made it here i can tell you that much
6351521 we just came out there and fought and everything was right

6351525 and what could be more entertaining than seeing superpowered arabs slicing through fighter jets with their swords
6351526 sending a kid to a hotel filled with sweaty single men in their 40s seemed like a bad move on paper but i was mercifully unmolested
6351527 americans seem glamorous when youre growing up in scotland you people had cars homes jobs and all your own teeth
6351528 but i did read a lot of british comics when i was very young the stuff was weird in hindsight a football strip called billys boots about a young lad possessed by a dead footballer whenever he tied up the laces on his old boots
6351529 if i said it was a commentary on violence id be sniggering at the same time because lets face it when you write a scene about a bullet taking four panels to pass through a human head you arent thinking about the social commentary
6351530 you just think it looks fucking cool real violence is obviously horrible but these are comic characters or highly paid actors its great watching bad shit happen to them
6351531 moore said all that after finding his greatest success with watchmen one of the darkest books of his generation theres a certain guilt that seems to hit creators after taking these characters to the max but the weird truth is that the greatest sales and greatest excitement comes from the dark stuff my own experience is that the darker you make the material the more popular it is both creatively and commercially who am i but a humble writer i cant argue with the readers
6351532 there is light then there is a boom and the light goes away and the swimmers must dance through the water searching for the light trying to rebuild their broken world and in the end the light returns and everything is beautiful
6351533 i dont really care about the score we cant control that what i want is a standing ovation if all the people who come to watch and see are standing up then it will be a success
6351534 it was full of dreams and heart warming i think many people are seeking something like this

6351539 you always have to be prepared for an at bat like that
6351540 when ive faced him before he has always thrown me away so i was looking to go to the opposite field but he threw me inside and i hit it good
6351541 he has had some big hits lately and theres not many bigger than that he really stepped up

6351544 there is a real supply disruption there and likely more of the caspian crude will stay bottled up with nowhere to go in the medium term
6351545 in case of the susceptible markets demand from occupiers in the it ites segment could be rationalised on the back of economic slowdown in the us
6351546 this coupled with the strong supply pipeline in many of these markets could lead to a potential consolidation in the respective markets leading to relatively higher vacancies

6351552 for the first time i have been told that my book is finding a new segment of readers because it has been translated into english
6351553 i am sure this has triggered curiosity about the book and how it was made
6351554 i will reveal some inside stories about chowringhee that i could not tell for fear of a british barrister i began my career as a clerk after my father passed away when i was barely in my teens i had to drop out of studies in search of a job the book was loosely based on him more as a tribute because he introduced me to the world of good writing now that he is no more i can share the inside stories
6351555 barwell stayed for a long time at the spencers hotel in kolkata and i was a frequent visitor to the hotel it was through common friends at spencers that i came to know what was happening at the great eastern hotel one of the biggest hotels in the metropolis then
6351556 so there was this notion that the book was inspired by great eastern hotel actually the muse was the spencers hotel it was from there that my love affair with hotels began
6351557 i got the idea to create the debonair sata bose the receptionist from a railway employee i chanced across his name was satya sdahan bose and since he had many sahib friends he refused to be identified by anything but sata bose

6351580 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6351581 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting

6351594 every time she tried to get away he beat her
6351595 she had the same type of burns her child had
6351596 we thought that was appropriate under the circumstances and was sufficient to hold him accountable and to punish him for the horrible acts against the child and the mother
6351597 all the people that have stepped into his life really appreciate all the donations
6351598 it will enrich his life and assist him in his life he is pretty much left with nothing but this trust fund

6351613 messi is a superstar he is a genius and my tactics against him didnt work well
6351614 to defend against lionel messi is the biggest thing we have to do we just have to make sure we stay close to him and we dont give him the chances like we did the last time in the under 20 world cup
6351615 their biggest star is messi thats it thats all he is the biggest star in that team
6351616 they are not only beatable but we will be victorious on that day
6351617 i believe in my team and they believe in themselves as you can see with the performance so far in the olympics
6351618 apart from us nobody really thought we would get here we have been replicating our performances every game we have continued to prove doubters wrong and we will do it again

6351622 you dont raise 45 million and then get shut down that doesnt make sense

6351624 the company is going through a process of the liquidation of assets so i dont have any more details than that
6351625 he was wiping out our phones as we were sitting there

6351635 if the business case of terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board incoming group managing director of public policy and communications david quilty said through a spokesman
6351636 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6351637 like any equity player you cant be a shareholder in a company unless you own some shares if we win the bid they will then have the option of coming on board
6351638 i think the roll out would start some time in the first half of next year the earlier the better
6351639 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards

6351650 despite the best efforts of police the trial powers were ineffective in assisting police to apprehend drug couriers on a sustained basis mr barbour said in a statement today
6351651 i have considerable reservations about whether these or similar powers will ever result in the cost effective detection of person involved in road based drug trafficking
6351652 overwhelmingly drug detection trial operations resulted in the detection of persons involved in minor possession offences rather than those involved in the supply or trafficking of indictable quantities of drugs mr barbour said

6351698 the 15 year programme will ensure that the uk has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6351699 it is absolutely essential to the conduct of operations and training that we have a guaranteed uk based high quality source of ammunition this contract provides precisely that

6351701 the market has stabilized in recent weeks and is no worse than it was in the second quarter but that still means the forward order book is close to 40 lower year on year with cancellation rates running at 33

6351713 while todays agreement represents a positive step forward for fiscal responsibility in state government the looming deficit we face next year will demand even more difficult choices
6351714 and given the significant continuing uncertainty within the economy there are no guarantees that we can avoid additional current year spending reductions if revenues plummet even further

6351733 at the heart of beijings food issues are cultural differences in eating styles between chinese and westerners chinese generally eat their meals early and at a table and many would find it unthinkable to eat an informal meal on the go or at a sporting event
6351734 this is further indication we have fewer dangerous schools the number came down significantly
6351735 by the same token we have a lot more work to do every kid and every family in this city is entitled to a safe school
6351736 we do our part and report we do not hide anything we follow the rules and thats probably what got us there
6351737 would i consider it a dangerous place no i take my 3 year old there

6351765 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6351766 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6351767 right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6351768 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6351769 concluzia discutiilor noastre a fost ca acum nu este momentul sa cautam responsabili pentru ceea ce s a intamplat in georgia ci este momentul prudentei si al actiunii intelepte avem nevoie ca prin prudenta si intelepciunea liderilor statelor din regiune zona sa fie foarte rapid stabilizata si securizata iar responsabilitatea pentru securitatea regiunii apartine tuturor liderilor statelor din regiune indiferent ca sunt lideri ai unor state mai mari sau mai mici mai influente sau mai putin influente
6351770 cu respectarea integrala a acordului de incetare a pacii promovat de presedintele sarkozy si acceptat de presedintii medvedev si saakashvili
6351771 dezvoltarea infrastructurilor de transport de gaze si de titei reprezinta unul dintre elementele cheie ale dezvoltarilor in anii urmatori atat pentru regiune cat si pentru piata ue
6351772 atat punctul de vedere al domnului presedinte aliyev cat si punctele mele de vedere coincid perfect nu exista zone de disputa sau neintelegere si o tara si cealalta considera ca securitatea regionala este baza pe care se poate construi si ca in statele care au pe teritoriul lor conflicte inghetate riscurile de instabilitate sunt crescute iar singura solutie de rezolvare corecta a problemelor de securitate generate de conflictele inghetate este respectarea integritatii teritoriale

6351778 we see the iphone 3g as a lifestyle product but both airtel and vodafone have priced them at levels similar to business mobile phones
6351779 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
6351780 the kicker is it does show 3 bars of 3g instead of 1 with 2 0 1 so it looks like they just changed the way the bars look with this update now thats useful
6351781 my new iphone 3g i almost threw it out my car window today it dropped 12 calls within 4 hours in downtown houston that is crazy
6351782 i live in the centre of the uks second largest city and my 3g reception is intermittent between 5 bars and zero therefore the connection keeps getting stuck
6351783 and this is after upgrading to 2 0 2 terrible
6351784 wow an acknowledgement by apple of the 3g defect with some of the iphone 3gs well kind of sort of maybe a little bit if you read between the lines
6351785 i suppose that adding in some modicum of connectivity for the new countries scheduled for iphone release on friday could be construed as improved communication with 3g networks

6351790 in real terms at current rates of inflation a pensioner couple will lose 98 this year in pension credit while a single pensioner will lose 90 just over 2 million pensioners across the country including many in northern ireland claim this credit and all will lose out to some extent in fact pensioners in ni will be even harder hit than these average figures for the uk suggest given that we pay some of the highest prices in the uk for light and heat
6351791 between 1 2 and 1 8 million pensioners in the uk failed to take up their entitlement of pension credit last year up to 1 2 million of those were living in poverty behind these statistics are many pensioners in northern ireland who are suffering at the hands of the labour government it is clear that this disgraceful situation can go on no longer this government is tired weak and hurting the most vulnerable people in the country with its incoherent and counter productive policies it falls to the conservative party to restore fairness for all in the united kingdom and that is something we will aim to do as we lay out our policies on these issues over the coming weeks
6351792 what use are parties like sinn fein and the dup to pensioners many vital issues such as pensions and benefits are decided at westminster but sinn fein boycott parliament and the dup are powerless to influence policy
6351793 i got touched in the face and i dont ever like that
6351794 but everything else went well i felt stronger than my opponent i had experience over him and expected to win
6351795 i am the only girl but its not like i want to separate myself
6351796 i used to want to be like them i still want to be like them
6351797 i think thats part of my motivation and drive to always be competitive with them and make sure that i was good enough to go and do what they can do
6351798 that was a point that could have ended my career
6351799 i could have stopped and said i dont want to do this but being patient and persevering built my integrity and confidence and made me who i am today
6351800 they never said once that i should have won the 04 trials i guess that helped make me who i am again i have a strong family and theyre not going to baby me even though i am the baby theyre never gonna do that
6351801 its not so much pressure for me im already here
6351802 of course i want to bring home a gold medal and thats what im planning on doing for me thats not pressure its a chance to show the world who i am
6351803 this is my goal whatever happened in the past happened i dont really worry too much about what people say i guess its good that people talk about me
6351804 and remember this feeling so youll train hard to never have this feeling again
6351805 win or lose im going to leave everything on the mat
6351806 we couldnt take the complaining anymore he always told me that he thought school was a waste of time
6351807 wed like to see them scale up to a full system beyond just tests sooner rather than later
6351808 the difference is we have molasses that degrades very quickly or oil that dissolves very slowly but provides enough dissolved material to feed the bacteria to do the same job
6351809 i recall john telling that story when we first got together in 1971 when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison
6351810 most of us had been kept apart or in small groups then in 1970 they moved us into the big cell and when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly instead of tapping through walls we had 24 hours a day seven days a week to talk to each other and we shared stories i vaguely recall that story being told among other stories
6351811 there were several stories similar to that in which guards a very few i might add showed compassion to the prisoners it was rare and i never met one but some of the guys did
6351812 when it was over i could see the clock on the wall and tell the time it was the best gift i could have hoped for

6351820 for a guy like michael phelps who isnt worried about obesity because hes burning thousands of calories as an athlete eating corn flakes and frosted flakes every so often is not an issue
6351821 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6351822 i am glad that it is acknowledged that brian died from a hospital acquired infection brian was a healthy young man going in to hospital and unfortunately he came out in a box
6351823 he was a great lad he was opinionated and argumentative funny witty and bright time will tell where he got it the infection i will have to think about whether to take it further
6351824 it is not that i want to blame anyone for what happened to brian but it is important to get some accountability for what happened to him so many people go in to hospital with minor ailments i do feel that if brian had not contracted mrsa he would be here today
6351825 i had got him a new wheelchair accessible vehicle which he was delighted with and he had got his own power chair so he had his own wheels
6351826 i feel sad for him that he did not get the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of having gone through a difficult and painful operation

6351841 agamis board has decided to shut the company down as the efforts to raise further capital didnt materialize in time its really unfortunate but that is true
6351842 the company is going through a process of the liquidation of assets so i dont have any more details than that
6351843 he was wiping out our phones as we were sitting there
6351844 we think people in the area and in the industry need to know what happened
6351845 we had a customer the other day calling for parts and they didnt know we shut down
6351846 the profile matched in the test and the dna report turned out positive which apparently shows that the girl was raped or sexually assaulted
6351847 might have had a love affair with someone in the village
6351848 the police told us the dna report is positive and it is the acknowledgement of the rape case
6351849 sperm of the of the arrested person has been found on elinas clothing according to the dna report
6351850 we are investigating the case whether she was raped and if not then how is it that the sperm is found on elinas clothing
6351851 police assured me that the charge sheet against the rapists will be submitted to the court soon and that they do not need any further evidence because the dna report has everything they need
6351852 the criminals are far too aged none of them so far identified is her classmate or in the same age range
6351853 what happened to her is inhumane and i do not find any reason why such a minor girl would be raped an outburst of religious anger because of their different christian faith could be the cause of this inhuman activity

6351881 with five blokes to every girl may i suggest that beauty disadvantaged women should proceed to mount isa
6351882 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
6351883 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
6351884 im a bloke who respects women i believe we should look after women im told men outnumber women here by five to one if thats the case then perhaps its an opportunity for some lonely women
6351885 it paints the women here as second rate and suggests the men will settle for anything i think its quite disgusting

6351888 i feel like me being in the middle or the outside its just wherever makes the team better
6351889 i just do my best when i am on the field and the other linebackers feed off each other we communicate well so no i have no preference really
6351890 i can tell you today we had decker in the middle jones at strong side and gordon at weak side
6351891 yesterday with the first group we had jones in the middle and denson and gordon at the outside
6351892 there is a still a battle for that third spot some of it has to do with who has bumps and bruises at the end of camp and things like that but i have been very very very happy with the way decker has stepped up from last year and with the way denson has stepped up from last year and quite honestly ryan allison has run some with the first string too so we have five linebackers we feel real good about
6351893 outside he is more comfortable and thats mainly just cause he did that all year last year
6351894 the other thing about him being on the outside is we can blitz him off the edge more and he is phenomenal blitzing off the edge
6351895 since i am used to playing corner covering a receiver or a tight end shouldnt be that hard for me at safety
6351896 overall the transition is pretty smooth im learning and picking it up pretty quick id rather be at corner but the move is what is good for the team at this moment
6351897 he is a physical guy he is a 211 pound safety that can really run that will hit you strike you and has great ball skills so it gives us a little bit of an added dimension there
6351898 i miss my mother and step father stories but its just got me awake late at night again thinking about it all and how i wish i could have spent more time with them hung out with graig more often and gotten to know him better none of us really knew a lot about him most of what zack and dylan know about him i had to tell them i wish my mom could be here to smartoff to me as we would always do to eachother where do you think i learned it

6351921 hes had longevity in his experiences worldwide he has foreign relations experience
6351922 i think that would be a comeback to the pundits and the people who say oh he doesnt have the experience i think that would balance it out as far as the general public thinks
6351923 i like the foreign relations experience i like that he knows the issues of the governor and i like that he represents the southwest and can bring the latino vote

6351925 the clintons are very very important to the democratic party i want to win and i think that helps us win

6351928 in particular i should make mention of alex wright of voyager estate reid bosward of kaesler wines and brian croser who needs no introduction all have willingly given their support without which this could not have become a reality i would also like to recognise the support of mbazima shilowa premier of gauteng south africa who has made a valuable commitment in agreeing to be the patron of the scholarship
6351929 it is our hope that the dombeya scholarship will play a key role in unearthing future wine industry leaders from previously disadvantaged backgrounds
6351930 the opportunity to work and study under some of australias most innovative winemakers and academics can only produce positive outcomes the lessons learned in the process will provide an invaluable grounding for a career in the wine industry and will also hopefully inspire others to follow

6352054 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6352055 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
6352056 its very important to realize there are a number of criteria that you use in tree selection and planting design what works for our soil types and climate on the delmarva peninsula may not be suitable for other locations
6352057 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
6352058 planting trees demonstrates that the poultry grower is being proactive to address potential concerns of neighbours gives the poultry farm a landscape appearance and increases property values adding the vegetative buffers also helps to reduce noise associated with farm operations

6352060 i have tremendous admiration for the intense dedication and certainly the innovation that you bring to the district
6352061 you bring strong leadership directness and clarity and that is going to be missed
6352062 we are not poised to do great things we are poised to do greater things we are an extremely healthy and vibrant district in spite of the budget situation on the state level
6352063 its been an up and down relationship between labor and administration
6352064 i can honestly say when you and i were thrown together it was during a particularly difficult time with a state budget and contact negotiations that seemed impossible
6352065 we worked it out and alan i give you a lot of credit for being a partner in that
6352066 you are leaving us in very good shape and no one can accuse you of deserting a sinking ship
6352067 the vision you made us all believe that this is a great district not just a great place to learn the fact that you love this place so much as i do i think it is going to be really hard to replace you
6352068 i know youve touched a lot of lives youve always been a strong advocate for students in every situation youve been in
6352069 clearly he is a great speaker thoughtful and with a lot of charisma
6352070 but its time to put some meat on the bones
6352071 if the republicans define him he will be in trouble
6352072 if he is able to define himself he can win
6352073 knowing who he is because hes been around for a while
6352074 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that one
6352075 most people will want to unify behind the candidate for the democratic party
6352076 one of the most important challenges he faces is at the convention he must define to the american people what he is about
6352077 someone like joe biden provides that experience that would be very helpful for a young president
6352078 you wish it would go beyond that but the people who run those campaigns ultimately use the same old approaches the problem is unfortunately it happens to work
6352079 hes got to be out there responding to these attacks himself so people know hes got the courage and the guts to be able to take those on directly you need to have the sound bite not from 40 different people but from him
6352080 hes got to be seen as a fighter thats one of the qualities that attracted a lot of people to hillary
6352081 clearly after eight years of the bush administration the public sees the future headed in the wrong direction
6352082 youve got to go after that and tell people how you can make things different
6352083 i really appreciate the accessibility of the show and that the focus is on individual accomplishment
6352084 you have athletes from widely varying backgrounds from international olympians like paul hamm jordan jovtchev and paul terek to 60 year old japanese sushi chefs competing alongside each other

6352086 if i win id use the money to open a video game arcade in santa cruz preferably downtown
6352087 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content even if youre supposed to pay for it on pcs is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a pc like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games
6352088 i think that if you went in and could see whats going on in their minds though they may never say that stuff and im not saying theres some conspiracy or something like that but i think the thing is they realise that trading content copyrighted or not is an expected benefit of owning a computer
6352089 i think that just based on their actions what they say is one thing but what they do is another
6352090 when it comes into debates about whether peer to peer file sharing networks that by and large have the vast majority im talking 99 per cent of the content is elicitly trading copyrighted property theyll come out on the side of the 1 per cent of the user doing it for legitimate benefit

6352136 right now theres a business whereby criminals are actually stealing with the hopes of being paid ransom rewards for what they steal
6352137 however when there are only dead ends in a case what do we do
6352138 it is a fact that insurance companies are often successful in negotiating the recovery of stolen art works where law enforcement agencies may not be
6352139 at the end of may the prospect of receiving all of this back with the exception of that piece of the argillite pipe wouldnt have really been believable so going from the fears that this could be melted down to recovering it has been just spectacular
6352140 people at the museum are just overjoyed at getting this material back
6352141 there were fears that it could have been melted down
6352142 given bill reids relationship with the museum of anthropology the special connection with the material to get it all back with the exception of this missing piece is almost everything that could have been hoped for
6352143 they are not in custody in relation to this investigation

6352220 the event is all about raising as much as possible for brandon and so well take the highest bid
6352221 weve got a start date now for the work on our house and were getting a place in the meantime so brandon should be getting out soon ive been in the hospital every day but were very grateful to hear that other people are putting work in to try and help with donations and the concert
6352222 brandon still cant see but its because of his brain rather than the eyes and hes started the exercising to try to walk again
6352223 in the past there hasnt been any provision made for benches its just over the last five years people have been asking for them in abundance we have waiting lists for every cemetery and crematorium in fife
6352224 we could see plenty of places where the bench could go but we were told every bit of ground was a potential grave even under the bushes behind the railway bank where there are big trees overhanging the whole bit of ground
6352225 theres already another persons bench at the foot of doreens grave were not fussy where the bench goes as long as its in the graveyard its very important to us to get her a bench mark really wants one as well hes even thought out what he wants on it
6352226 theyre choc a bloc with memorial benches at hillend and as a compromise the family are going to have a tree in the interim until they can get the bench
6352227 you feel for the family because it would be a bit of closure for them to get the bench and move on
6352228 the more memorial benches that are put in the fewer grave sites would be available
6352229 we understand that many people want to commemorate the lives of their loved ones by putting a bench in the cemetery and we do everything we can to make that possible however there are 16 benches in hillend cemetery and unfortunately space for more is now at a premium
6352230 in the meantime we are encouraging families to explore other alternatives which include planting a tree to remember loved ones

6352232 about 1255 hours school lunch hour on friday 8th december 2006 sakander riaz sold a 14 year old child two bottles of fortified wine and a bottle of cider at these premises in this instance riaz actually placed the alcohol within the childs schoolbag and at no time did he ask the 14 year old for any identification as proof of age
6352233 since the riaz family took over this shop in 2003 significant evidence has existed that the manner in which the premises were being operated has led directly to the surrounding area being frequented by numerous youths the knock on effect being increased levels of anti social behaviour and crime
6352234 who intimate that what was once a quiet street has now been turned into a haven for drunken behaviour

6352239 intellect welcomes the ruling in the us court of appeal open source licences are just as important for compliance as those purchased from proprietary vendors software use must still comply with the terms and conditions this can include an obligation to share any changes made with others in the community giving the same protection to open source software as to traditional software models ensures that open source has a sustainable future
6352240 it is great news it means it is no longer viable to say there are all sorts of risks associated with open source and it will make a difference in terms of market and media perceptions proprietary suppliers have been claiming it is risky and that tactic is less likely to work now
6352241 open source is a large movement and this is one relatively minor licence among many open source licences so even if the ruling had not come it would not have made the open source movement collapse but it is a nice step forward that one of the licences is enforceable which is a good thing
6352242 i know a range of open source projects where firms took their code with impunity on the assumption no one could do anything
6352243 so this ruling gives all open source licences stronger ground to say you must respect our intellectual property
6352244 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks
6352245 in particular the systems for storage of data for public order purposes should be logically separated from the systems used for business purposes
6352246 the requirement of 12 months retention will be extended to three then five years because that is how these things go the industry will say it is intrusive and expensive and that the cost of compliance will add to the cost of providing services
6352247 i entirely agree that before major new databases are launched careful consideration must be given to the impact on individuals liberties and on society as a whole sadly there have been too many developments where there has not been sufficient openness transparency or public debate

6352254 the cost of making the proprietary oyster scheme compatible with the new standard which would cover readers pads systems and equipment on buses would certainly exceed the 100m mark so it would work out cheaper for tfl to roll out a new system as opposed to re fitting the existing platform
6352255 there are a number of itso readers ticketing structures and back office systems in the market so the integration challenges are much tougher
6352256 the contractual break happened at a very interesting time because tfl still needs to analyse the bids and the new system will probably take about two years to deploy so getting that done in time for the olympics will surely be tough
6352257 tfl must not let the expertise go and should concentrate on delivering a seamless handover by transferring knowledge and documenting the process carefully as well as having a contingency plan
6352258 london cannot afford to have a malfunctioning system supporting the transport network especially in 2012

6352260 testing is going well but the delays have been caused by a difficulty in getting access to the trains
6352261 i cannot believe that trains are running all the time there should be a way to ensure the technology is fitted whether that is done overnight or during maintenance
6352262 if there are issues in getting access to trains virgin trains should have worked out ways to mitigate that beforehand with some good planning perhaps their announcement that onboard wi fi would be available in 2007 was a bit p remature
6352263 instead of concentrating on business growth and innovation we are now turning our heads to efficiencies and cost cutting we are in the process of devising our budgeting for next year and it plans have changed in line with the new business strategy
6352264 keeping the departments morale during tough times is no easy task but communicating the changes is essential
6352265 it is a question of doing different things as opposed to stopping doing anything and telling people that projects may be slightly different to what we had planned originally in the next two years the focus is driving efficiency as much as we can so that we are well positioned to return to growth and innovation when the downturn is over
6352266 the recession represents an opportunity for process rejuvenation while we have yet to see this start in anger we expect a sea of transformation type deals to be signed in vertical markets from public sector to retail and financial services as companies see the downturn as an opportunity to de layer current business practices

6352282 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6352283 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses

6352285 armstrong says that positive thinking and doing a lot of sports can save you i dont agree

6352290 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6352291 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6352292 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives

6352298 my body had given everything i was having a real sugar low and i was swimming in zigzags and not knowing what was going on

6352300 i had some ups and downs along the way but this medal was completely unexpected this time last year
6352301 do not have and in the foreseeable future will not have any target other than russian intercontinental ballistic missiles
6352302 russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches procedures
6352303 by definition such grouping can have no relation to the response to the imaginary iranian threat not only does tehran which the us stubbornly uses to scare the europeans have no motivation but it will simply have no technological possibilities to threaten europe with a missile attack in the years to come let alone the united states
6352304 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties
6352305 the british didnt come through in 1939 you declared war but you didnt go to war thats why were demanding capabilities boots on the ground and not just parchment
6352306 we should expect that elements of a us missile shield will be placed not only in lithuania but also in all territories bordering russia and controlled by nato
6352307 the us wants to create an impenetrable shield capable of intercepting and destroying russian nuclear missiles on launch pads in the initial trajectory in orbit and on the final trajectory
6352308 a lot of profits for defence contractors but no real addition to us security
6352309 its all a lot of sword rattling but its a sham

6352323 i think the share price will hover around 75 euros for the next few days then will retreat until investors see whether there will be information on possible synergies

6352371 he sufrido desde que he salido no sab a lo que pod a hacer he intentado ir con una sonrisa de oreja a oreja y pidi ndole a mi padre que pudiera llegar al kil metro 20 porque lo iba a pasar mal las condiciones han sido muy buenas y las marcas incre bles he llegado con un r cord de espa a que no sab a que iba a hacer porque no he ido condicionada por un ritmo sino que ten a que ir a muerte hasta el kil metro 20

6352375 competir con olga es saber que s lo hay dos medallas
6352376 estaba bien porque el asfalto estaba mal pero se ha llenado por debajo de agua y eso era como saltar obst culos
6352377 me he enterado media hora antes de competir no sab a nada lo m nimo que hemos podido hacer ha sido esto y lo nico que puedo decir es que esta competici n va dedicada a estas v ctimas lo sentimos mucho y le damos nuestro m s sincero p same
6352378 una buena carrera un buen puesto y una buena marca

6352395 open border activists and some elected officials have a primary goal and that goal is to oust joe arpaio from office this november
6352396 all attempts of doing so is an affront not only to the sheriff but also to the vast majority of maricopa county citizens who believe joe arpaio is upholding all the laws in arizona
6352397 now we have had conversations with some of you already to help ease your minds about the drivel and lies being repeated over and over again by these activist and some local print media regarding our illegal immigration operations and the overall police work being done by mcso
6352398 they know that without sheriff arpaio and county attorney andy thomas this countys fight to reduce illegal immigration would shrivel up and die

6352401 if you believe the british press the youth of today is aimless feckless and hopeless addicted to their playstations lacking in respect and lacking in the emotional discipline needed to cope with a big match occasion
6352402 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness
6352403 and if you look at what is happening at the beijing olympics you can see what piffle that is
6352404 boris johnson is immensely proud of what young british athletes have achieved in beijing
6352405 their success is a tribute to their sense of ambition determination and self discipline
6352406 these are the qualities he is keen to encourage in teenagers across london where a lack of purpose discipline and self esteem lead many to wasted lives and violence
6352407 david cameron is right to highlight that serious and destructive social breakdown
6352408 politicians who pretend there is not a problem are complacent and should recognise that there is a huge challenge if every teenager is to fulfil their potential as our athletes have managed this week
6352409 this is the first major contract to be awarded in the 1 5 billion project due to be built over the next 10 to 15 years
6352410 this contract is a major milestone in constructing the port in an economic climate where the building industry is experiencing a sharp slow down this is great news for essex and the uk in general
6352411 london gateway is vitally important for todays uk economy it will deliver the most efficient and technologically advanced port in the world and much needed deep sea capacity for the uk

6352414 for idea cellular rs 94 is a very big resistance but given the kind of market situation we are in i dont think it is going to come in a hurry so it is going to take sometime for any major trend to really set in on the upside to get into some kind of a long haul momentum move we need to get pass rs 94 so rs 94 itself is quite a good percentage point away at this stage latch on and keep a stoploss if the level of rs 80 breaks down that is an important support you are again going to head into new lows so keep a stoploss of rs 80 and hold on its just about giving your trade a chance and it is not that it is looking extremely bullish or something
6352415 damit war klar dass frankfurt um eine brutvogelart reicher geworden ist
6352416 a similar policy will be followed for release of rice
6352417 grasim industries has seen a good upside over the last month its still in a hold mode rs 1900 is a fairly big support for it and if you are willing to enter keeping a stoploss closer to about rs 1840 or rs 1845 then its worth it so on declines but that stoploss is very essential at this stage
6352418 nagarjuna fertilisers is poised for a much more long term and should be a relatively safe option if any short term pressures also to creep in rs 38 is the level to watch out for so i would keep a stoploss at this stage of rs 38 for longer term with a one year plus horizon you could be looking at a range somewhere between about rs 52 and rs 55 as a price target

6352431 comprised solely of government departments and industry lobby groups that would be provided with special access to treaty documentation and discussion
6352432 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6352433 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6352434 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6352435 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6352436 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6352437 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6352438 i couldve been to the pro bowl instead of dropping about 10 picks
6352439 i was starting to have a really good season last year then came the injury now im back so i need to have a really good year im anxious to go out there and show the real carlos

6352446 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6352447 right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6352448 it also means its our turn to be as corrupt and irresponsible to the democratic process as their white predecessors have been
6352449 i recall john f kennedy president of the united states when he became president he recommended his brother right
6352450 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6352451 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not

6352459 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
6352460 thats not good with your expecta tions to say yeah i think im going to get sent down after each start
6352461 but the last couple starts its hard to think they can give me any more opportunities than they have in this stretch especially with only a month and a half left in the season and the pennant race as close as it is now
6352462 youve got to send guys out there that you believe theyre going to go out there and give you a win or give you six seven innings and i havent been doing that so i hate to say it was the right decision but i believe it was
6352463 i think we felt like we need to give him a little bit of a renewed start
6352464 because its obviously not working right now i think we all believe strongly that it will work but at the moment its difficult
6352465 to me youre putting a lot of pressure on yourself
6352466 with the game the way it was we had a lead we kind of had the upper hand on them you dont want to give them any opportunities and i think that kind of opened the door a little bit
6352467 hes got as good stuff as anybody on this team when he realizes that and believes in that hes going to be back and big for us
6352468 you feel an obligation certainly never to hurt anybody but also you see guys jumping over the fence trying to make plays
6352469 up here youre in a pennant race ive never been one to say that pressure was too much for me but ive felt like ive had a lot of weight on my shoulders just trying to be perfect trying to do everything as well as i could to help this team win and it hasnt been near good enough
6352470 the decision was coming it had to be made soon they had given me ample opportunity to help this team and to help myself out up here and it just hasnt worked out
6352471 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6352472 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6352473 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6352474 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6352475 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6352476 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6352477 i would never go back there in my life because if anything like that happens again theres no organization theres no plan
6352478 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6352479 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6352480 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6352481 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6352482 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6352483 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6352484 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6352485 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6352486 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6352487 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6352488 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6352489 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6352490 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6352491 i dont know where to go from here but i know i had to shut it down and well see how it is today
6352492 im very disappointed because i was ahead of schedule i was a week or two ahead and i was going to go on a rehab assignment monday at triple a and now this i was sprinting and i felt something and i had to stop i had to push it and it didnt react too well
6352493 ive been on a routine schedule and ive put in my work and extra work and i really dedicated myself to getting back on the field
6352494 people dont understand how frustrating it is for a player not to play this is what ive done all of my life i wake up every morning and i play baseball when thats taken away from you you feel empty and lost but i was getting excited again because i felt i was getting closer i guess im a fast healer because my leg was really responding
6352495 whenever you suffer an injury it makes you mad and it makes you frustrated
6352496 right now after all the work ive put in to make it back i feel like crying you go through a lot of things to make that return i stretch i come out early to take ground balls do your extra hitting when you cant do it it just doesnt feel right
6352497 when you play the game this is the month when you want to be out there helping your team win its just not the same thing sitting on the bench and cheering on your team when youve played all your life been a starter all your major league career you come to the ballpark and you want to play

6352500 yeah i think so i guess the one thing we havent done is we havent let him throw but if hes not ready tuesday we wont pitch him well back him up a couple more days thats how it goes i dont think thats going to happen but if it did wed just back him up and i told him that the important thing for us is to pitch him when hes ready to pitch not just because his day comes up
6352501 he slept on it weve all probably done it to some extent whether its your back or elbow you wake up and if you have some inflammation and then you go out and pitch i think were a little bit hesitant to let a guy pitch and put him at risk we dont want to do that so thats kind of where were at so if there are some symptoms weve held him back thats basically what it is
6352502 i think through doing some homework they kind of came to the conclusion that this is what had been happening to the point where i think we got a lot more comfortable with the explanation
6352503 but still at the same time were not going to pitch him till hes symptom free we wouldnt do that
6352504 i dont think we were disrespectful or ignorant of him i do understand that now hes on the dl
6352505 thats why i called him i actually called andy and their pitching coach the next day after the all star game also because i didnt want them to think we were flippant about their pitchers i wouldnt want to see a kid go on the dl anyway and i hope i didnt have something to do with it
6352506 the mccain camp is probably happy that obama is on everything and that hes the focus they want to make obama the target and make him look like a celebrity someone who is good looking young and who gives great speeches but has no substance its very obvious that they dont want the focus to be on john mccain
6352507 barack has captured a very different potential electorate that includes a lot of youth culture and thats reflected in fashion and music
6352508 the people who want to wear his paraphernalia want to be different so the clothes and objects available are a signal of his strength among this potential electorate
6352509 well these companies selling these items are not actually supporting the candidates i dont believe that its just about what sells
6352510 the fact that more of it is aimed at obama supporters doesnt mean a lot
6352511 barack is cool and mccain is less than cool hes almost 72 hes not cool and the sales just mean that the kind of people voting for him are less likely to buy that stuff
6352512 oh come on theres no dignity left in american campaigns
6352513 there was a time when standing up and bragging about yourself and talking about why youre so much better than the other candidate was considered rude

6352590 i won the first three games because i took more initiatives
6352591 but when i was close to victory i actually started to become shaky and to lose confidence i became more conservative because i was scared of losing the fourth game

6352634 youve probably been wondering where has need for speed been weve been pretty quiet
6352635 weve been kind of taking stock of things sitting back and really trying to figure out how do we tell stories within our games

6352637 but its how we weave that story and narrative and combine the two into a really compelling interactive experience that everyone knows and comes to love
6352638 this is an evolution of previous need for speed s a best of breed

6352679 but basic questions over the business case for nfc remain and there are sharp differences of opinion on how the market will develop
6352680 in many ways nfc shares similarities with the early days of the smart card industry particularly with the electronic purse
6352681 everyone thought cash would be redundant by now and wed all be using electronic money instead
6352682 but the business issues were very complex and in the end consumer demand wasnt strong enough to overcome the commercial barriers
6352683 with nfc though it is different consumers love using nfc and its that consumer demand that is set to drive adoption forward as service providers see the opportunity to use nfc as a competitive differentiator

6352690 which was given to me by a marvelous engraver and last year at the end of the 07 telethon he presented me with this gorgeous gift i put it in that traveling case and i hadnt traveled since that telethon until that day
6352691 but i know that you want to see the cave dont you ill show you
6352692 its odd standing here in the same area where my ancestors were buried i felt really strange when i had the bones the skull of my great great great grandfather dating back 120 generations in my hands
6352693 i cant describe it the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end it wasnt exactly a nice feeling but it was an incredible experience that i wont ever forget the 3 000 year old bones are so far removed from our lives today and these 120 generations thats so long ago
6352694 we have no idea what happened during this time we dont know what happened to these people
6352695 it is a unique discovery while we were examining the prehistoric bones of the male individuals we found genetic patterns which are unique
6352696 we wanted to find out whether these genetic patterns were still present in the living population of this area so we put an advert in the local paper and we asked people to take part in our project 270 people came forward we were very surprised that so many wanted to help us
6352697 the local residents had to give a sample of saliva we extracted dna from the saliva and looked for the genetic patterns on the y chromosome in the end we found two men who have a very similar genetic pattern to the prehistoric one and that genetic pattern is unique
6352698 i saw the advert in the paper and i thought it was an interesting idea
6352699 they took a sample of saliva using cotton wool buds they put it in a plastic tube and then sealed it the scientists also had their mouths covered to prevent any mixing of the dna samples
6352700 i didnt expect it at all to end up being the direct descendant of the cavemen its amazing especially as on that particular day i had such a dry mouth i thought the dna sample wouldnt work
6352701 your appearance is determined by both parents by the mother and father we were investigating the y chromosome from father to son in our project its a modern phenomenon that we move around in the old days people normally lived and stayed in the same place where they were born
6352702 i definitely think the shape of the head is similar to the caveman but after 3 000 years and 120 generations im sure personalities have changed

6352740 there are myriad ways for americas small businesses to grow online from targeted online advertising campaigns to enhanced search engine optimization
6352741 it became obvious we needed a presence on the web
6352742 we knew we didnt want to spend 10 000 to get started and we also didnt want to have someone do it for us who would turn around and keep charging us to maintain it
6352743 the internet is a fantastic platform for businesses of any size and stripe

6352749 ladies get a grip playing golf for business and pleasure the feminine way
6352750 i wrote the book to teach women the basic stokes terms and game etiquette so they not only can have fun but also gradually break into the boys club and begin cultivating the professional relationships needed to enhance their careers
6352751 women who know how to crush a golf ball always get noticed by the guys so theres plenty of potential for dating and romance

6352759 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move

6352762 for a player its always hard to say when but i think the time is right for me now to make the ultimate decision
6352763 we have some great players coming through here players like sam burgess andy lynch and koppy craig kopczak and i just feel the time is right to hang up my boots and enjoy the game from the sidelines
6352764 joe has probably been up there with robbie paul as the most significant overseas signing the club has ever made
6352765 in terms of overall contributions to the club both on and off the field his presence is simply immense and there will be a whole host of players who will be glad to see the back of joe vagana so they dont have to play against him
6352766 he will be a great loss to the club on the field and also off it because of the shear amount of work he has done for the club in that area
6352767 i felt we linked up well and both of us could have been on the scoresheet
6352768 if we get the nod in a couple of weeks hopefully it will get better
6352769 but it was good preparation for the big one in the couple of weeks time
6352770 we were able to blood one or two new players we had a look at some partnerships passed it quite well at times

6352779 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6352780 you were led into this offending by your contact with another man in a chatroom and he sent you these images
6352781 they were viewed but not stored and they were not collected systematically
6352782 he feels real shame for looking at them he knows he has been such an idiot
6352783 i was asked if id had any experience of violence in my past as a child there was always this story about one of my relatives being murdered as a child you dont always take it in but when i was asked that question it came back to me
6352784 i started looking into it and martha giles was my great aunt as a family member and with a background as a crime writer i wanted to find out more about it
6352785 its very much a personal interest i wouldnt want to upset family members by turning this into a novel but i could write it as a factual book
6352786 it would be nice with all the new advances if we could get someone looking at it again
6352787 if theres anybody who remembers anything about it i would like to hear from them there might be nurses from the time who remember something
6352788 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mikaels versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season
6352789 his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mikael has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6352790 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6352791 injuries have ripped the heart out of what we have been doing
6352792 we do not have too many alternatives the system we had planned and worked on is now giving us problems
6352793 we had been working on a system that was looking good but then we have had bad injuries to james collins danny gabbidon and lewin nyatanga and we have got to virtually start again
6352794 we have had a bad day at the office on two fronts i am very disappointed with the manner of the defeat and the goals we conceded were just schoolboy mistakes
6352795 in the first half we played some very good football and could have been further in the lead
6352796 our football certainly deserved more of a reward but we lacked a cutting edge in the second period
6352797 as a result of the talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6352798 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members

6352830 if we get the nod in a couple of weeks hopefully it will get better
6352831 it was another game under the boss and another positive performance
6352832 yes the result was disappointing but we feel we should have won the game and barring a couple of really good saves from their keeper we would have won the game
6352833 but it was good preparation for the big one in the couple of weeks
6352834 as always we defended well as a team but i thought the midfield were outstanding the movement passing and their energy was fantastic so we have to take positives

6352847 im just a bit disappointed because we should have won both games more comfortably we had a few one on ones in both games which could have made it a bit easier
6352848 i think we are starting to play some really good football which is very pleasing we have eight or nine new players so its not going to work overnight but i think at times we have played some super stuff
6352849 if we can win at home on saturday we might even go top once you get that going you get a bit of a buzz about the place and build a bit of momentum the games certainly come thick and fast but the players like to play especially after all the pre season friendlies

6352857 infine c la questione non risolta dei permessi sportivi troppi e incontrollabili secondo polizia e carabinieri e unemergenza grave sempre pi inquietante spiega il portavoce nazionale del sap massimo montebove ci vuole una stretta rapida da parte del governo per limitare il possesso di armi per uso sportivo e anche per la caccia
6352858 spesso le questure sono costrette dalla legge a concedere i permessi a persone note per utilizzarle in tuttaltro modo ci vogliono pi controlli nei poligoni per verificare chi veramente spara per sport se il signor x non s mai presentato questo dovrebbe far scattare una verifica e nei casi pi significativi la sospensione immediata
6352859 molti delitti vengono consumati proprio con armi regolari tanto facile procurarsele e detenerle hanno firmato stragi familiari e delitti passionali noi siamo convinti che in italia debbano circolare sempre meno pistole o fucili e lo stato sottolinea montebove che deve avere il compito di tutelare la sicurezza la filosofia americana dellautodifesa personale non compatibile con la nostra cultura e anche in america sta fallendo

6352933 you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6352934 going into the game i thought we had one advantage and thats a lot for us
6352935 i thought it was patrick mills i thought he was someone their point guards would have trouble with
6352936 im glad my duke team doesnt play st marys this season
6352937 if we dont approach every game like its our last we can be beat
6352938 if we dont come into it and offensively make that key pass if defensively we dont help each other and we start reverting back to individuals then we could lose but its going to be tough
6352939 coach k is one of the greatest coaches that we have i try to lead on the court so it wont happen
6352940 what happens is were up one at the end of the first quarter and everyone probably says we knew this was going to happen
6352941 this team here we understand its a 40 minute game sooner or later well impose our will and i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6352942 lester was staring out the window at the concrete buildings and deciding that he already didnt like new york the people in the airport looked pale and agitated the people looked washed out and exhausted so did the buildings and what trees there were sagged under the weight of their withered leaves there was nothing humorous about this place it seemed just a monolith of gray concrete so far new york was certainly not for him
6352943 they have fulfiled their promise it will go a long way to strengthen our relationship with ncs as the mother body of sports in this country
6352944 we think the exposure is minimal but we certainly would not want to risk any of our student information being exposed to a security breach
6352945 even when there is a presumption of confidentiality we dont have that social security number in the mix
6352946 each organization that is hired to do another piece loses the sense of urgency the personal contact and sense of responsibility are gone
6352947 luoghi di ritrovo giovanili dove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope
6352948 estremisti il segretario del circolo un maggiorenne che pare abbia provveduto a convincere alliscrizione e allattivismo altri ragazzi

6352953 ho fatto il drug test ma per lui era falso e ha continuato a dire che mi drogo
6352954 niente politica lunico riferimento i luoghi di ritrovo frequentati dal ragazzo
6352955 mio padre ha preso spunto dalla mia tessera di giovane comunista per sostenere che mia madre non in grado di badare a me perch i comunisti sono persone che portano i figli su una brutta strada
6352956 nessun riferimento diretto o indiretto alla militanza politica del ragazzo
6352957 dovrei stare con mio padre ma dopo unaggressione che ho subito ho deciso di andare da mia madre
6352958 lui non fa altro che associare i comunisti detto in tono dispregiativo sempre con droga spinelli alcol insomma una vita sbandata sregolata da non seguire mentre invece io mi trovo bene con il mio gruppo le nostre idee da quando io sono cresciuto sono cambiate io frequento un liceo che ha idee di sinistra invece lui detesta i comunisti
6352959 a seguito di queste continue insinuazioni mia madre mi ha portato in un centro medico dove sono stato sottoposto al drug test ho fatto il test per dimostrare che non facevo uso di droghe con il risultato davanti mio padre ha continuato a dire che io mi drogo e che il test era stato falsificato questo purtroppo un punto fermo sul quale lui crede di potersi appoggiare per vincere a modo suo questa guerra
6352960 adesso sto studiando dice perch devo recuperare i debiti formativi sino ad ora sono stato al mare mi sono abbastanza divertito negli spiragli di tempo che ho trascorso al di fuori da questa brutta storia

6352963 ho deciso di inviare un telegramma di solidariet e vicinanza alla madre del ragazzo
6352964 i comunisti sono unorganizzazione estremista solo perch fuori dal parlamento ci vogliono fuori legge
6352965 appartenere a un partito comunista dice motivo cos disdicevole per un ragazzo tanto da accusare la madre e non fargli avere laffidamento del figlio
6352966 se credano possa essere consentito a un servizio sociale dello stato sindacare sulle idee politiche di un giovane e farne oggetto di valutazione
6352967 non capiamo i motivi che hanno spinto il tribunale a prendere questa decisione dice lavvocato il ragazzo non si droga non ha commesso reati la cosa che ci ha colpiti che viene citato come appartenente a un gruppo estremista
6352968 nel provvedimento non c alcun riferimento diretto indiretto alla militanza politica del ragazzo o a luoghi di ritrovo riconducibili a movimenti politici
6352969 lunico riferimento contenuto nel provvedimento riguarda la frequentazione del ragazzo relativa a luoghi di ritrovo giovanili dove diffuso luso di sostanze alcoliche e psicotrope ma questi non sono riconducibili a partiti
6352970 non stata presa in considerazione e possibile spiega il magistrato che il padre abbia prodotto fotocopia di una tessera di appartenenza a un partito ma per noi questo assolutamente indifferente

6353015 we are delighted to congratulate the reach scholars who earned high marks on rigorous college level exams
6353016 i would have thought for kids who were on the borderline that they would have seen an improvement
6353017 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6353018 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6353019 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6353020 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6353021 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6353022 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6353023 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6353024 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6353025 i often thought that if i could have given up and done something else i would have done
6353026 retrospectively i can see that i was learning all the time but it was often difficult i was employed sometimes and i had things in development but there were a lot of disappointments it was not so much stubbornness or even belief i just carried on writing to deal with disappointment i had to write for the sake of writing not some imaginary reward
6353027 the richard amp judy booker venn diagram crossover no i dont think theyve ever done that
6353028 he raised his hand again quickly and she flinched and hated herself for flinching but he didnt hit her he smiled at her and they both knew this was the beginning
6353029 its about our fear of young men our fear of outsiders
6353030 were doing it at the moment with young men too anybody standing at a corner wearing the wrong sort of hood is a devil as if the rest of society isnt imploding around us anyway
6353031 it was always a compulsion to write to tell stories but it just never occurred to me that i might be a novelist that seemed a much scarier thing to do
6353032 my sister said to me youd be so good at writing something really funny about women and i thought oh god thats the sort of book i wouldnt want to read and who wants to write that
6353033 all the life of it was still there so i just felt as if it hadnt been told it wasnt done all of lewiss early life was unfolding i didnt know where to put it all it wasnt another film and really to keep myself sane i thought ill put it down as a book but i still wasnt thinking i was going to write a novel just thinking ive just got to tell this
6353034 its such an emotional story love and grief and all these giant feelings i was always trying to find that balance where it wouldnt tip over into overstating a thing but where it wouldnt be so cool as not to tell it
6353035 in my mad head it was sort of a novelisation film scripts are like the tops of little mountain peaks or the tips of icebergs then having the rest of the iceberg there and being liberated to write that iceberg it was like being let off the lead it was wonderful
6353036 wont that be fun ill be thinking do we need to have this and that bits rubbish were not going for that i think i have to liberate myself from whats there itll be hard to do
6353037 it will do my head in its too precarious im not happy with it i might never show it im in one of those states
6353038 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6353039 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6353040 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6353041 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6353042 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing 5 to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6353043 fire was put out pretty quickly and we are investigating what caused the fire
6353044 im really upset when they first moved in i would take her for shopping and show her around its very sad
6353045 her husband died in january this year and she would often come and talk to me
6353046 the fuselage is destroyed the plane burned i have seen a kilometre of charred land and few whole pieces of the fuselage it is all destruction
6353047 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6353048 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6353049 if that duplication of the gene may be 5 per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6353050 in the end not many students got charged so what was the point

6353079 i thought that if im having this much fun imagine what people who dont have the opportunity to drive this type of equipment would feel thats how dig this came about
6353080 youre not here to dig a ditch or push a pile of dirt in record time
6353081 its better to pick up a small layer deposit it and then go back
6353082 youre stressing the hydraulics by taking up too much dirt
6353083 well make barbara stack her rocks to make up for that advantage
6353084 bump the boulder into it and then scoop it out

6353090 it is the time surrounding menopause its actually a six to 13 year process in people whose ovaries are normal and healthy
6353091 for those women who are exercising who are eating well who are really happy in their work and relationships they may go through perimenopause never even notice it for the vast majority of women whose lives are overstressed under nutriented under exercised its a big wake up call because your body is less forgiving than it was in the past

6353096 i noticed i wasnt happy at work i lost my will to do a lot of things that interest me like art and schoolwork i worked very hard during college i was very involved in clubs i noticed that my will to do things just diminished tremendously
6353097 patients with parkinsons disease lack a sufficient amount of dopamine this brain chemical allows us to produce smooth coordinated movements like moving your arm up and down
6353098 there is rigidity which makes it very difficult for the patient to move like theyre moving in a vat of tar there is a resting tremor that is characteristic in one arm or leg
6353099 patient and outreach services from rochester general hospital the women youre about to meet offer a very personal approach to the serious problem of being uninsured
6353100 it is pretty safe to assume that the pass rate at a and a is going to be 20 or more this year
6353101 there has been a lot of effort put into improving maths standards
6353102 we could be starting to see some of the fruits of that
6353103 this year there are more options than ever before for those wanting to stay in education and for those who prefer to work and learn can aim for a job that offers an apprenticeship or some form of recognised training perhaps with day release to a local college
6353104 they might end up between 50 60 golds i am not surprised
6353105 the world has to learn to live with a change of geopolitical nature
6353106 it chinas sporting success will last as long as their sports system lasts
6353107 the ioc is very happy with the organization of the games
6353108 the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
6353109 it is not a pleasant thing to think that 25 km 15 miles from sochi there is a potential conflict region of abkhazia

6353111 i expect all of them to be back and more
6353112 the majority of the party thinks that asif zardari should be president
6353113 but of course we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6353114 allora lascia che ti invii questo copione forse vorrai dirigerlo
6353115 beh penso che se dovessi dirigere qualcosa george sarebbe uno dei migliori mentori specialmente se si tratta di una pellicola ad alto tasso di effetti speciali
6353116 i cant get into specifics other than to say it is not uncommon during a course of an investigation that a sum of money is paid for information
6353117 was attempting to make contact with an unknown party at ubc with whom he could discuss the stolen items and a possible reward for their return
6353118 right now theres a business whereby criminals are actually stealing with the hopes of being paid ransom rewards for what they steal
6353119 however when there are only dead ends in a case what do we do
6353120 it is a fact that insurance companies are often successful in negotiating the recovery of stolen art works where law enforcement agencies may not be
6353121 we are lowering our third quarter estimates to reflect the difficult operating environment characterized by lower client related trading volumes and losses on hard to sell assets
6353122 even under the potentially more stringent rating agency guidelines related to the amount of preferred securities in the capital mix we anticipate that lehman can absorb over 3 billion of after tax losses without adding more common equity

6353136 the other guy volquez threw two balls at guys heads im just shocked
6353137 if what theyre doing is working why are they questioning it
6353138 i think that philosophically the vast majority of teachers understand where the districts coming from
6353139 but that doesnt mean thats not sort of a shock for a teacher who has been in the district a while and who doesnt have a masters degree
6353140 in this day and age theres a lot of school comparisons going on by people who are moving into the market and we want to compare favorably in all aspects of education in the marketplace
6353141 we encourage teachers to get their masters degree and continuously improve
6353142 i think that anything that you can expose yourself to potentially broadens your ability to be a better teacher
6353143 i still see a lot of generalist masters programs that are pretty easy and painless for teachers to get through
6353144 its still hard to push programs that push people they just want to get a degree and a pay raise
6353145 but i think we can all refine our art form

6353157 dat doen we door de politiemensen van hier en van daar met elkaar in contact te brengen het wordt een vorm van uitwisseling
6353158 met elkaar gaan we een lijst maken van onderwerpen waarbij samenwerking nodig is
6353159 per jaar gaan we samen aan n of twee onderwerpen werken
6353160 probleem daar is de transitopositie van de eilanden er worden veel drugs doorgevoerd de enorm lange kust van de over een groot gebied verspreide eilanden is moeilijk te bewaken
6353161 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
6353162 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now
6353163 those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
6353164 decree of closure of the churches and chapels of our lady of graces kinsley our lady of lourdes ackworth st edmunds airedale st gerard majella featherstone st john the baptist allerton bywater st josephs crofton

6353167 nulla contro la brava giornalista ma non sar che filippo labbia detto perch sar nel cast del suo programma il dubbio pi che lecito o no
6353168 i am really feeling sad and have no words to describe this pathetic show
6353169 frankly speaking i had no hopes of a medal from the team that was picked for the olympics but i was expecting pakistan to finish at least at fifth or sixth place not what they have achieved
6353170 our deep defense was nowhere near average what to talk about good and excellent
6353171 the only way we can move forward is by saying thank you very much to the senior players and start grooming youngsters for the asian games
6353172 defense was seen nowhere in any one of the group matches and we kept on interchanging our two goalkeepers salman akbar and nasir ahmed
6353173 we only defeated canada and south africa in the pool matches because these countries are still going through the progressive phase in international hockey but we have a name in international hockey which was badly damaged at beijing
6353174 i did not see any urgency in the forward line to pressurize opponents defense just because our players lacked in fitness and only occasionally they looked like threatening the opposition
6353175 right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6353176 ha habido peticiones de otros pa ses antes am rica por estados unidos por un entrenador que falleci aqu en un asesinato zambia porque ha muerto su presidente y luego lo m s cruel que ha sido georgia rusia
6353177 en los tres casos los pa ses han hecho peticiones al coi y el coi tom la decisi n de que no se pondr a la bandera a media asta
6353178 nosotros defendemos y debatimos lo que tenemos que defender y debatir en los despachos pero una vez tomada la decisi n es irrevocable
6353179 creo que sta es la mejor forma de demostrar la solidaridad y el dolor que queda en el deporte espa ol y las solidaridad con las familias de la v ctimas y de los heridos

6353182 es ist zwar neu dass man l nger vor dem computer sitzt aber das hat offensichtlich keine auswirkungen auf den generellen energieverbrauch
6353183 golf is not bad but as prices are unstable and the economic situation is not getting better president lee thinks they need to consider public sentiment
6353184 messi is a superstar he is a genius and my tactics against him didnt work well
6353185 to defend against lionel messi is the biggest thing we have to do we just have to make sure we stay close to him and we dont give him the chances like we did the last time in the under 20 world cup
6353186 their biggest star is messi thats it thats all he is the biggest star in that team
6353187 they are not only beatable but we will be victorious on that day
6353188 i believe in my team and they believe in themselves as you can see with the performance so far in the olympics
6353189 apart from us nobody really thought we would get here we have been replicating our performances every game we have continued to prove doubters wrong and we will do it again
6353190 for argentina to beat us they are going to have to do a very good job
6353191 this argentine team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics in order to win the gold medal
6353192 weve got a lot of players from the fifa under 20 world cup where we defeated brazil in the semi finals and nigeria in the final so weve got everything under control
6353193 once again we have seen a welcome increase in results at gcse despite the lowest entry for five years this is evidence of the hard work of the students and the continued dedication of their teachers
6353194 the core subjects at gcse continue to dominate and still account for almost half of the full course entry
6353195 i think theres a certain amount of inverted snobbery here the idea that vocational courses like engineering construction and it are inherently less worthwhile than french and geography is simply wrong
6353196 after playing cuba the last time the team in itself made an agreement that we would never play that level of volleyball ever again
6353197 im just hoping that in two days we play the same style of volleyball and we get the same results
6353198 our reception was very bad and we made many mistakes in service
6353199 at agora est o sendo identificados pelas impress es digitais alguns casos precisar o de exames de dna
6353200 its a time of big celebrations for all of us
6353201 im so happy that despite the war lack of sports facilities and training nikpai managed to secure a medal
6353202 it is indeed a big honour and a matter of great happiness for all of afghanistan for this is the first time an afghan athlete has managed to win a medal
6353203 because the disease is undiagnosed insurance companies wont cover the medical bills associated with her condition the rita foundation is holding this 5k fundraiser to help the family pay the medical bills
6353204 i am so thankful that i am involved with such a great group of women that will come

6353207 the area of boscundle has suffered problems with groups of youths gathering in certain areas there is little in the way of resources and public transport and any new youth based activities will help in a rural area such as this one of the issues we have is teenagers who have a lack of proper facilities a golf course like this is a very welcome amenity and will undoubtedly help reduce crime
6353208 estamos muito muito perto de um acuerdo sobre o status futuro das tropas americanas no iraque
6353209 o governo vai fazer todos os esfor os para apoiar as fam lias neste momento dif cil quando elas receberam a not cia desta trag dia
6353210 they have experienced some of these natural disasters and after a lot of hard work and support they are able to stabilize
6353211 thats what i think their challenge is and they seem to continue to have met it over the years
6353212 the real issue is whether or not were in a period where these floods are occurring more frequently or not
6353213 one of the most beautiful magnificent places in the world and should be seen by everyone
6353214 it really truly is among the most beautiful places on earth
6353215 when you get down by havasu falls its as though kodak made an outdoor movie set
6353216 committed to making this years nominating convention the greenest in party history
6353217 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6353218 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6353219 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6353220 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6353221 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6353222 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6353223 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6353224 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6353225 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6353226 a mudan a da laser para a star transcende at o resultado acho que era o momento de tentar alguma coisa diferente n s estamos muito felizes velejando na star juntos

6353236 signs of being overextended at a time when the football program is undergoing rapid growth and success
6353237 has taken steps to address the issues and concerns that were raised in the internal audit
6353238 he just felt tight after the game and it was bothering him
6353239 we checked it out its one of those situations where if you can go you go if you cant then you have to have the surgery he tried it and he cant do that so weve moved on
6353240 a player can function or cant function and right now kevin cant function we know kevins a very tough guy and he was trying but he was just not able to get open out there
6353241 it feels like someone has stabbed you in the abdominal area its excruciating pain i dont know how you can play through it probably the smartest decision you can make is to fix it
6353242 he is coming off a heck of a season if his play drops he is not going to go to the media and say im hurt hes a stand up guy and will say im not doing the job the organization lets him get it fixed so he can be mentally back
6353243 after you get surgery you will feel 100 times better and youre going to feel you can work out and start routes be running and try to rehab but dont push it too soon
6353244 they were all going to play anyway so theyll play a little bit more now
6353245 i just hope to go out there and make a great impression
6353246 i dont see it as having to make up for anything
6353247 last year was last year this is a brand new year nobody has any yards anywhere we have to come out and do what we have to do our offense will continue to flourish were capable of getting better and making plays
6353248 sento che questa storia pu durare 2 minuti o 20 anni
6353249 i mean its all about challenge obviously we welcome all comers and we know what a great team greece is argentina theyre the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it the last time
6353250 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6353251 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6353252 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6353253 we are very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6353254 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players
6353255 i dont want the fans to get on him about my situation
6353256 he kind of just got thrown into this whole thing things dont need to be directed at him and i wanted that to be known
6353257 its hard to say it that way when you say my name fast
6353258 coach reid has enough trust in me and confidence like i said i didnt know where i was going to be once i got back with my teammates
6353259 once i got back with my teammates i was thinking if they put me second group or third group i would follow suit and work my way back up
6353260 i really didnt have a clue you can go out and practice and it can be one thing and they say hey youre not going to play you have to do your job
6353261 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6353262 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6353263 i think another week of practice will definitely move me over the edge and ill be ready for the regular season
6353264 however i have been away from the guys and havent struggled with them or sweated with them i feel bad about that but i practiced this week and felt pretty good i think i am getting the trust from my teammates and offensive line back
6353265 he is going to take two or three steps forward and one back on occasion max is a fine player i think you win games with players like max
6353266 its not painful where i cant play i feel good to go
6353267 that might take him a while to get settled because of who he is his makeup and how he goes about things hes quiet
6353268 i think hes pretty much available until we see something different
6353269 i think his fastball command has been as good as its been all year and hes back to being pretty economical as far as the number of pitches hes throwing per inning
6353270 if he wasnt able to throw a strike when he had to then id be worried about his delivery and his mechanics
6353271 for me the approach has been all wrong he hasnt been focused on staying down in the strike zone he hasnt been focused on getting contact on the ground early in counts and thats who he is hes pitched too cautiously hes a contact ground ball guy
6353272 all year long weve been trying to preserve what weve got here
6353273 poor judgment was used by bringing an airsoft gun that can be purchased at wal mart on campus
6353274 other guys will have to step up for the time that curtis is out well be fine there
6353275 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6353276 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6353277 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool
6353278 i think that a major field of application will be to help manufacturers abide by the european union law concerning the ban of dog and cat fur trade next year
6353279 there was some jazz in the ussr especially in the big cities
6353280 in 18 years i never missed a salary payment to any of the musicians
6353281 its not a real salary and even that i cant afford anymore
6353282 it was hard we were always struggling for money and everyone knew that but in the past year it got much worse
6353283 make it almost impossible to get any funding for anything
6353284 grandiose promises for funding that end up as nothing but lies
6353285 one of the main reasons i established the college was to create an interdisciplinary academic process in which musicians learn everything they need to make it in the music business our first goal was to change the image of a musician as someone who just creates and cant manage his or her own affairs
6353286 the nice thing was that the professional musicians who have been doing it for 30 and 40 years and who played with the best orchestras in russia were happy to collaborate with a 22 yearold israeli music student
6353287 i wanted to instill the big band jazz tradition into israel it was also an opportunity to perform a zionist act by absorbing some of the new immigrants from the fsu they couldnt hear jazz on public radio there so they had to listen to it in secret they would write down the notation they heard of the songs from listening to the music so if they heard a glen miller song they wrote down each separate band members notation and built it up that way
6353288 i thought this educational activity was one of the most important undertakings we did as a band
6353289 now some of the musicians are playing in the streets next to an overturned hat looking for a few shekels this is the state of israel and this is the kind of assistance that is given here the israeli symphony gets nis 10 million a year and we got only nis 350 000 to keep the band going
6353290 but you must understand that there is no such thing as a selfsustaining money making jazz band there isnt one artistic group in the world that is a closed financial system every group from the ny philharmonic to the berlin opera is funded from various sources for years i waited for someone to come and say they wanted to fund the band for the past year and a half we havent received any money from the ministry of culture and ive had to take bank loans to pay salaries
6353291 were not looking for charity or gifts we want to perform for the people
6353292 the musicians have been crushed theyve been forced to take jobs as street sweepers which is fine every job is respectable but on the hed stage i gave them a chance to prove that being a musician is a worthy profession now that its over not only is their livelihood gone but so is their sense of pride in their chosen profession when i see one of my saxophonists busking at the nahalat binyamin market in tel aviv to get a few shekels a day my heart bleeds
6353293 you didnt have to give up the farm system to go get a guy
6353294 when im on the mound i dont try to think too much about anything i dont even know what my name is all i try to do is concentrate on chris costes mitt and where i want to throw the pitch and what pitch i want to throw
6353295 i was thinking that guys fast i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6353296 i had received information about a specific drug supplier wada received this persons name address and phone number who was allegedly working with elite track athletes
6353297 he takes one stride and i have to take 21 2 to keep up
6353298 its ridiculous when michael johnson did it it didnt look that easy how fast can a human being go
6353299 it is poetry in motion hes a gazelle and he has to get to 26 27 before he hits his proverbial prime
6353300 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6353301 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6353302 you just cant think about it you have to go out and give your team the best chance to win
6353303 but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be
6353304 sometimes i get caught up in trying not to make a mistake because one can make the difference right now
6353305 thats the reality of the situation i know theres not a lot of room for error
6353306 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6353307 the president personally called rohullah nikpai and congratulated him for this achievement
6353308 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6353309 i cannot express my feelings in words while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6353310 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6353311 its what you grow up as a kid and wish for
6353312 i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers
6353313 id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
6353314 i peeked in on her and she was sleeping i went in there a couple times
6353315 she woke up jumped on the bed and came running to me it was really cute
6353316 then im going to be waiting for the weekend because im going to crash during that time
6353317 i got a massage after the race and my masseur thought it felt great
6353318 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6353319 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6353320 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6353321 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6353322 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6353323 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6353324 they could have built a 20 000 seat arena and filled it but they sacrificed capacity for intimacy and all these little details the fans are right on top of the action able to see it all even when there are several matches being played simultaneously
6353325 but at least they havent allowed them to bring in the drums
6353326 ping pong players are huge celebrities here they have to be whisked in and out of restaurants like movie stars or basketball stars in america
6353327 its true i have friends who once played ping pong but now they love yao and kobe bryant and the nba
6353328 fans in the u s follow baseball basketball football but when theres only one sport thats sanctioned and when the media only reports on that one sport of course its going to be the most popular
6353329 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
6353330 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
6353331 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
6353332 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
6353333 in the uk alone two million people have diabetes and up to 750 000 are believed to be carriers of the condition without even realising
6353334 these are worrying statistics but by diagnosing the disease in patients early on a number of measures can be put in place to minimise any related health issues findings from this research could really help with early diagnosis if opticians were equipped with the knowledge and technology to spot health concerns which could indicate the first signs of diabetes the uks early diagnosis rate could be improved significantly

6353354 leicesters involvement in this major research project is a direct result of our international reputation for research on the analysis of safety critical control software
6353355 future esa missions like the autonomous robotic satellites which will collect and return samples from the surface of mars require control systems involving complex requirements system architectures software algorithms and hardware implementations
6353356 key elements for the development of such autonomous rendezvous control systems are the availability of reliable analysis tools for the verification and validation of complex system behaviour
6353357 in this new project we will develop and test control system analysis techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of this verification and validation process
6353358 this latest project is the third major research contract we have recently been awarded by esa and confirms that the leicester control group is now at the forefront of european research on space control systems
6353359 whats the best way to get from here to there
6353360 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
6353361 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
6353362 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
6353363 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
6353364 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
6353365 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
6353366 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge
6353367 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6353368 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6353369 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6353370 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin
6353371 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
6353372 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken

6353374 at the bottom of the sea we find mountains which are about the same height as the alps
6353375 these are partially overlaid by sediments so that we have to look beneath the surface to find clues hinting at the geological history of the mendeleev ridge
6353376 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
6353377 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
6353378 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
6353379 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
6353380 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
6353381 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones

6353388 when you speak about security in south africa you give me one country in the world where security is at 100 sure it is not possible
6353389 we know that in south africa that its not the best but if you know where the devil is then you know also how to take measures against that

6353413 heute war mein vater bei uns er hat mir wohl auch das regenwetter geschenkt weil ich die hitze nicht so mag
6353414 ich habe mich etwa 500 meter vor dem ziel etwas behakt und aufgerieben und im schlussspurt wurde ich von david davies etwas abgedr ngt aber das geh rt dazu

6353420 my biggest regret is not ever being able to take part in an olympics
6353421 during my time as a player it was forbidden for professionals to participate

6353432 mcgill has been at the forefront of medical discovery for almost 200 years
6353433 this important award supports our commitment to remain at the forefront of medical discovery for future generations of physicians and scientists our scientists at mcgill and the muhc share this commitment and have been rewarded for their efforts and vision i am proud and delighted the kinds of transformative scientific discoveries and advancements that will be made in this state of the art facility will have worldwide repercussions in health care for generations to come
6353434 thanks to the cfi our plan to bring together our investigators on the glen and mountain campuses in order to bridge biomedical research and clinical medicine is assured
6353435 the award will support building areas of roughly 40 000 gsm 400 000 gsf for the research institutes centre for innovative medicine centre for translational biology and evaluative research infrastructure on the glen campus the addition of research neighbourhoods shared platforms and equipment for 180 clinical evaluative and biomedical researchers will enhance the muhcs capacity for meaningful innovation dramatically i am tremendously proud of the leadership of our research institutes director dr vassilios papadopoulos and the entire muhc mcgill team who worked on this landmark application
6353436 our researchers are currently spread out over more than 65 separate labs located in 50 to 100 year old buildings that impose severe constraints on their activities
6353437 given the world class achievements of our scientists and clinicians in these poor conditions one can only dream of the discoveries that will emerge from a modern facility that is designed to encourage the interdisciplinary collaborations and synergies that are the basis for true scientific innovation
6353438 this historic decision by the cfi underscores the absolute need of partnerships harnessing the strengths and resources of governments the private sector and world class institutions like mcgill and the muhc
6353439 together truly transformative research requiring this level of investment and collaboration is possible and we applaud the cfis vision in supporting our exciting project
6353440 this award represents a strategic boost to the research capacity of mcgill university and the muhc
6353441 this project selected through a rigorous assessment process will help ensure that researchers and graduate students at the muhc have access to a world class research facility and training environment

6353458 the nature of cancer treatment necessitates frequent hospital visits and many cancer patients make over 60 trips to hospital during the course of their treatment as a result cancer patients are hit particularly hard both financially and emotionally by travelling costs and unfair parking charges

6353487 o placar foi justo sa mos bem tivemos chance de matar o jogo duas vezes com o diego e o kl ber n o fizemos o inter cresceu e fez o resultado depois que o inter virou ficou com todo espa o poss vel e foi melhor foi um placar por merecimento deles
6353488 quando se perde o jogo se acha um monte de culpados eu s vi um o inter que jogou bem e virou o placar n o sou santos dumont n o vou ficar inventando desculpas os jogadores sabiam que o ndio chegava daquele jeito mas erraram o que normal no futebol
6353489 deu para perceber que tivemos o jogo nas m os com 1 a 0 contra o inter estava desequilibrado tanto que roubamos duas tr s bolas da zaga deles t nhamos que ter matado o jogo eles iam ficar desestabilizados totalmente o goleiro deles j estava at empurrando o nosso jogador depois que viraram controlaram o jogo
6353490 se o p nalti n o existiu e o gol do inter estava em posi o legal o tite est correto n o tenho que discutir o que est claro
6353491 tivemos chances reais mas o pessoal esteve um pouco ansioso a gente cria tem a oportunidade mas falta a felicidade de marcar

6353493 simply because having too many workers becomes unproductive well let portions of our employees take time off for their families when theyre recharged and ready to tackle the demands of the las vegas nevada politics consumer demand well open our doors once again in the meantime lets be cautious and not jump to conclusions
6353494 and i think as we look forward a lot will depend on the behavior of consumers if they choose to spend their money well get out of the slow times fast if however on the other hand they decided to save it or pay off debt were looking at a more bear market
6353495 i trust the word of leanora alkins especially in these times
6353496 and will look to other analysts of the same ilk to gauge how we move forward in this environment
6353497 im excited about the future possibilities in our las vegas nevada politics industry
6353498 because i know in the long run its all going to work out just fine
6353499 its true were laying off workers because of the economy but the ones were laying off are employees that contribute little to our operations our best employees continue to hold their jobs and will continue with us as long as they maintain their excellent records further were going to reward our las vegas nevada politics market analysts who are in high demand with a cost of living raise plus 2 of their salaries
6353500 but i am confident of long term gains that will help drive the las vegas nevada politics market area forward

6353508 a culture of impunity within the israeli forces which is contributing to routine use of reckless and disproportionate force
6353509 the decision of the tank crew and the officers who authorized the shot was reasonable since the suspicious figures and suspected missile presented a clear and present danger to the lives of the idf soldiers

6353534 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6353535 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6353536 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6353537 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6353538 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6353539 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home

6353545 i send all my shoes from the local post office i dont know where i stand i cant afford to take everything down to castle douglas to post
6353546 theyve also said in the past i can get stamps on the internet but on radio or television programmes they dont mention there is an extra charge over and above the cost of the stamps theres a charge for the software
6353547 its getting too difficult to do anything local the question i have for the post office is what am i meant to do just close up shop
6353548 i have to get shoes to customers for when they want them not when the post office feels like it im in a very difficult position
6353549 im not happy about it and ive got a lot of unhappy customers
6353550 well do our best to keep it open but im not convinced itll work
6353551 weve been aware it was coming for a while but its still a blow when it comes
6353552 were the only shop in the village and we have no pub or any other facilities
6353553 im only supposed to be open from 9am until 12 30pm but i open in the afternoon as well as im not going to turn people away but the post office havent taken that into consideration
6353554 everybody is sick about it not everybody has a car or a bank account these days and people still rely on their local post office
6353555 being the owner of a small business and with the post office being a business rather than a service i can see how they need to meet new challenges
6353556 i just feel its the end of an era and along with the liquor licences is another blow to the viability of the village shop
6353557 i cant believe theyve decided to close a post office in this position as we serve a large area i cant see the sense in what they are proposing
6353558 i havent heard anything as stupid as the mobile service they are replacing folk will have to walk across a grass verge to get to a mobile van it will turn to mud
6353559 it will also make it difficult for older people to get to a post office
6353560 post office closures are not good news for customers but the government has decided that a significant number are necessary to help put in place a sustainable network for the long term
6353561 this is not a consultation about how many post offices will close it is about ensuring the ones that are closed minimise inconvenience to customers
6353562 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6353563 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6353564 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6353565 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6353566 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6353567 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6353568 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6353569 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6353570 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6353571 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6353572 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6353573 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6353574 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6353575 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6353576 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6353577 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6353578 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6353579 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6353580 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6353581 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6353582 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6353583 hes a massive bloke but that doesnt sacrifice any athleticism ball skill or speed
6353584 the elvs have required a more mobile and skillful no 8 and he is that combined with size it makes him really effective the other thing the laws have done has created more one on one scenarios and he thrives there
6353585 hes still young but pretty complete at the moment hell get better with time but he has the potential to be the best no 8 in the world
6353586 weve got a similar situation with george smith and phil waugh
6353587 people will always have their preferences but to have two players of their quality in your squad can never be a negative thing
6353588 how you manage them is important robbie deans head coach has always been honest with them so they know what their roles are and what is required of them
6353589 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6353590 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6353591 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6353592 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6353593 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6353594 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6353595 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6353596 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6353597 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6353598 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6353599 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6353600 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6353601 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6353602 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6353603 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6353604 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6353605 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6353606 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6353607 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6353608 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6353609 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6353610 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6353611 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6353612 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6353613 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6353614 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6353615 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6353616 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6353617 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6353618 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6353619 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6353620 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6353621 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6353622 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6353623 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6353624 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6353625 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6353626 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6353627 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6353628 this complacent attitude is being exploited by professional criminals people need to take more precautions as in the current climate things that were not previously desirable for thefts have become so
6353629 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6353630 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6353631 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6353632 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6353633 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6353634 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6353635 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6353636 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6353637 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6353638 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6353639 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6353640 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6353641 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6353642 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6353643 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6353644 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6353645 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6353646 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6353647 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6353648 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6353649 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6353650 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6353651 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6353652 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6353653 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6353654 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6353655 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6353656 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6353657 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6353658 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6353659 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6353660 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6353661 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6353662 if an animal can fit through an apartment window in manhattan someone will have it as a pet
6353663 alongside the grey squirrel japanese knotweed and the american mink the signal crayfish is one of the most problematic invasive species introduced to these shores and it is proving to be a particular problem in dumfries and galloway
6353664 american signal crayfish eat almost anything including fish eggs and pray on young fish including salmon and trout they have been known to enter the nesting tunnels of birds such as kingfishers and eat their young
6353665 this leaflet seeks to raise awareness of the signal crayfish which is a particular problem in the galloway area notably on loch ken any angler who catches one is urged to kill it on sight and to inform snh or the scottish government local agricultural or fisheries office
6353666 there have been leaflets before but if this is a further indication that the scottish government is taking the matter seriously then i welcome it
6353667 biodiversity security is vitally important and crayfish are extremely damaging to valuable waters the government needs to redouble its efforts and come forward with concrete action on catching or otherwise reducing the number of crayfish
6353668 having said that to be fair they are in the process of agreeing a programme of trapping and destroying the crayfish it seems to me they are now taking the matter seriously which i welcome
6353669 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6353670 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6353671 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6353672 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6353673 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6353674 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6353675 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6353676 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6353677 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6353678 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6353679 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6353680 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6353681 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6353682 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6353683 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6353684 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6353685 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6353686 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6353687 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6353688 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6353689 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6353690 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6353691 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6353692 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6353693 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6353694 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6353695 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6353696 i believe in a society where what matters is where youre going to not where you come from
6353697 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6353698 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6353699 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6353700 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6353701 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6353702 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6353703 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6353704 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6353705 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6353706 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6353707 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6353708 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6353709 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6353710 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6353711 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6353712 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6353713 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
6353714 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
6353715 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6353716 they told me there are going to be resources here
6353717 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6353718 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6353719 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6353720 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6353721 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6353722 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6353723 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6353724 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6353725 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6353726 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
6353727 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6353728 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6353729 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6353730 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6353731 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6353732 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6353733 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6353734 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6353735 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6353736 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6353737 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6353738 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6353739 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6353740 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6353741 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6353742 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6353743 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6353744 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6353745 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6353746 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6353747 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6353748 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6353749 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6353750 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6353751 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6353752 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6353753 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6353754 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6353755 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6353756 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6353757 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6353758 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6353759 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6353760 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6353761 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6353762 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6353763 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6353764 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6353765 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6353766 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6353767 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6353768 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6353769 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6353770 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6353771 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6353772 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6353773 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6353774 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6353775 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6353776 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6353777 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6353778 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6353779 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6353780 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6353781 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6353782 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6353783 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6353784 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6353785 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6353786 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6353787 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6353788 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6353789 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6353790 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6353791 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6353792 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6353793 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6353794 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6353795 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6353796 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6353797 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6353798 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs

6353808 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6353809 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6353810 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6353811 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates

6353819 it had better be true or the entire structure of mathematics would crumble to the ground
6353820 because of the time constraint ill leave the proof to you
6353821 the proof for this is long and arduous so it is given in the appendix
6353822 if it is on the problem sheet then it must be true
6353823 let a be the number such that this proof works
6353824 and the lord said let it be true and it was true
6353825 well it works for 17 so it works for all reals

6353832 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public

6353840 instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralised facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6353841 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive
6353842 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 4 800 an ounce
6353843 and if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6353844 as gasoline prices continue to rise hydrogen produced from renewable sources such as bio liquids will be more and more competitive also the possibility of using hydrogen in fuel cells will provide much higher efficiency than internal combustion engines can so the actual cost in dollars per mile may already be lower
6353845 rather than being a clean alternative to fossil fuels biofuels are actually increasing carbon dioxide emissions hydrogen fuelled cars are still a long way off the immediate priority for cutting emissions is smarter cars that burn less fuel
6353846 the fourth monday in august is really in my opinion family friendly and its putting money in our classrooms
6353847 i cant say the delayed start date didnt have an effect but theres obviously other variables
6353848 the school districts were so against having a uniform start date that theyre not ever going to admit theres any benefit
6353849 when you look at august to august utility bills there were savings even though electricity rates went up this was a smart move
6353850 the tourism industry pushed very hard and successfully to move the school start date later in the year to no sooner than the last monday of august
6353851 the argument was that cities would benefit from increased sales taxes meanwhile districts have less time to prepare for taks and midyear holidays must be truncated or eliminated altogether
6353852 i really think the legislature would be well advised to give local boards the opportunity to set their start times
6353853 i understand why theyre not happy i do but in the legislature you have to look at the bigger picture
6353854 if you can subtract some august days from your air conditioning bill you cant help but to save money

6353857 de laatste decennia is er veel meer over depressie bekend geworden iets wat heeft te maken met een toename van onderzoeken depressie wordt sneller herkend
6353858 ook al verklaart het de depressie epidemie niet volledig fabrikanten van antidepressiva hebben met hun wervingscampagnes een grote invloed in het massaal toegenomen gebruik van geneesmiddelen
6353859 vroeger waren omstandigheden de oorzaak voor voorspoed en ellende nu gaat het om het individuele brein en zijn we meer verantwoordelijkheid gaan dragen
6353860 het leven wordt steeds ingewikkelder er komen steeds meer regels en het wordt hoe langer hoe zwaarder jezelf tevreden te stellen je ziet jezelf falen tegenover jezelf tegenover de samenleving tezelfdertijd lijkt het alsof die andere mensen het ene succes na het andere boeken vreselijk want mensen vergelijken hun situatie niet met de armen in de ontwikkelingslanden maar met hun directe omgeving

6353870 the creative proposals that came through from player x were very encouraging and in line with what we are hoping to do with these two licenses we are looking forward to seeing our games reach new audiences as well as those who are already acquainted with our titles
6353871 we are delighted to be working with sce wws on this

6353875 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6353876 certainly we continue to ask for as much transparency as possible
6353877 we would of course welcome that the areas are genuinely used
6353878 i think everybody has the right to speak this is not the same as demonstrating
6353879 obviously we were not happy they didnt move faster to clean up the adjacent properties
6353880 theyre coming out saying come for lunch come for lunch
6353881 i think what needs to be reviewed is whether you should have an agency overseeing these really important functions
6353882 its been like hitting your head against the wall you cant get long standing zoning altered without significant provincial input
6353883 lets figure out exactly what went wrong before we act precipitously

6353886 garth and mark present one of the strongest driver combinations in the field and allow us to put our best foot forward
6353887 this is the best possible strategy for us to look after garths championship while still chasing race wins
6353888 there are lots of drivers who arrive in f1 and you know that theyre good but theyre sort of missing an ingredient
6353889 i think hes got that extra ingredient id be very surprised if he wasnt on the shopping list of the top teams
6353890 there comes a point where drivers want to be in f1 to win they will demand to have the equipment to do that i think bmw have a strategy which is ambitious but at the moment they are not quite in the front line of
6353891 the break is over and its time for the last part of the season to start its time to concentrate again on my work
6353892 f1 is a sport which never stops and the team has worked hard to be ready for the race in valencia from now on every single race will be extremely important and every single point will have a great value the less there are the more important they become

6353902 do you want whats in the box or whats behind door number three
6353903 at the time there was widespread bipartisan agreement that the spokane compact should limit the potential for expanded gambling in our state this is exactly the result the governor achieved
6353904 this is way beyond what the public wants to swallow
6353905 the high stakes the no limits no one else has that and i cant understand how they came up with this
6353906 gambling revenue is a tempting place to look to fill budget shortfalls but all this does is create a codependence
6353907 the clinton and bush foreign policy teams acted on the basis of two false premises
6353908 one was that russia is innately aggressive and that the end of the cold war could not possibly change this so we had to expand our military alliance up to its borders
6353909 the other premise was that russia would always be too weak to endanger any new nato members so we would never have to commit troops to defend them it would cost us nothing they were wrong on both counts
6353910 on the night of aug 7 saakashvili ordered an artillery barrage against tskhinvali and sent an armored column to occupy the town he apparently hoped that western support would protect georgia from major russian retaliation even though russian peacekeepers were almost certainly killed or wounded in the georgian assault it was a huge miscalculation
6353911 was foolish and possibly criminal but unlike putin he has led his country in a broadly democratic direction curbed corruption and presided over rapid economic growth that has not relied as russias mostly does on high oil and gas prices
6353912 not because im pro abortion but because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
6353913 finally he expressed his wish to reduce the number of abortions while not restricting access to them
6353914 i intervened extensively in everything our foreign policy in a lot of problems in development in housing because there were no institutions or an administrative system that were able to do so
6353915 i pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you know the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints and know his incomparably great power for us who believe

6353922 let me make it clear i am being treated for cancer
6353923 im going after it aggressively i have been undergoing treatments as prescribed by my physicians much to the surprise of my family and close friends im being obedient doing what the doctors tell me to do
6353924 the results are encouraging the doctors say im responding well the outlook is good im optimistic most of all i feel fine and i anticipate resuming a full work schedule
6353925 god knows we wish her the best shes one of the old time democrats there arent many of us left i was very sorry to hear about this but shes a fighter and she will beat this one way or another we old gals have unlimited possibilities
6353926 she is going through a series of treatments as prescribed by her physician he said
6353927 she is having treatments on an outpatient basis in harrisburg
6353928 is confident of a full recovery like other challenges shes had during her life of public service and like other people who have faced this illness she is confronting it openly he said
6353929 people get sick they undergo treatment they recover right now the lieutenant governor is in the treatment stage he said

6353936 we were quite impressed by the impact that gov pawlenty has on mccains chances
6353937 our analysis suggests that the mccain ticket jumps by 13 points by adding gov pawlenty to the ticket that is quite an impact
6353938 i would hope that some of his ideas would be fresh
6353939 add because im a senior i hope some of my needs and concerns are his needs and concerns
6353940 he doesnt get carried away with things hes calm and his values are pretty much what i would call my own at the present time
6353941 obviously barack obama was not on stage and mccain had it all to himself
6353942 so you want to ask was that poll reflective of the general state of play in minnesota because for the most part polling over the three months before barack obama went on vacation showed the race as a double digit obama lead

6353972 che la prima sezione civile del tribunale di catania motivi una sentenza con le stesse argomentazioni non e solo gravissimo ma inaccettabile in uno stato di diritto
6353973 ho quindi scritto al presidente della repubblica giorgio napolitano affinche nella sua veste di garante della costituzione e di presidente del consiglio superiore della magistratura intervenga per porre rimedio a questa situazione inaccettabile mi aspetto anche che il sindaco di catania e il presidente del consiglio intervengano sollecitamente ai loro rispettivi livelli per garantire che i servizi sociali operino allinterno dei diritti e dello spirito della costituzione lattivita degli organi statali al di fuori del quadro costituzionale e infatti a tutti gli effetti eversiva e lassenza di un sollecito intervento per ripristinare una situazione di legalita costituzionale non potrebbe essere lasciata passare senza conseguenze

6354018 allah der m chtige und majest tische siebte seine sch pfung und w hlte die banu adam unter ihr aus dann siebte er durch die banu adam und erw hlte aus ihnen die araber dann siebte er die araber und erw hlte aus ihnen die quraisch dann siebte er die quraisch und erw hlte die banu haschim dann siebte er die banu haschim und erw hlte aus ihnen mich ich bin also der beste der besten wer also die araber liebt liebt sie aufgrund seiner liebe zu mir wer die araber hasst hasst sie aufgrund seines hasses auf mich
6354019 der beste dieser gemeinschaft ist der mit den meisten frauen
6354020 heiratet und pflanzt euch fort ich m chte andere gemeinschaften durch eure zahl bertreffen
6354021 wer immer die m glichkeit dazu hat soll heiraten es wendet den blick ab und sch tzt die privaten teile vor unerlaubtem
6354022 wie kann es sein dass die heirat so viele tugenden besitzt wenn allah jahja den sohn zakarijjas daf r pries dass dieser keusch blieb wie konnte allah ihn preisen wenn er etwas nicht tat was als tugendhaft angesehen wurde weiterhin blieb isa ibn mariam unverheiratet wenn die dinge sind wie ihr behauptet h tte er dann nicht geheiratet
6354023 allah verf gte dass ich in eurer welt frauen und wohlger che liebe und dass die freude meines herzens das gebet ist
6354024 mir wurde anderen menschen gegen ber vorz glichkeit in vier dingen gew hrt gro z gigkeit mut manneskraft und die f higkeit feinde zu berw ltigen
6354025 er ist ehrw rdig in dieser und der n chsten welt
6354026 nimm den weg des verzeihens befehle das richtige und wende dich ab von den unwissenden
6354027 oh muhammad allah befiehlt dir dich mit denen zu einigen die sich von dir trennen und denjenigen zu geben die sich weigern dir zu geben und denen zu vergeben die dir gegen ber ungerecht sind
6354028 so gedulde dich denn wie die standhaften unter den gesandten sich geduldet hatten und sei standhaft
6354029 der gesandte allahs m ge allah ihn segnen und ihm frieden geben traf keine entscheidung in der er nicht die leichtere von zwei sache w hlte solange dies keine falsche handlung war wenn es eine falsche handlung war dann war er derjenige unter den menschen der am weitesten davon entfernt war der gesandte allahs bte keine vergeltung f r sich selbst solange nicht die ehre hurma allahs betroffen war dann bte er um allahs willen vergeltung
6354030 wenn du doch nur einen fluch gegen sie u ern w rdest
6354031 ich wurde nicht gesandt um zu verfluchen sondern ich wurde als warner und als eine gnade gesandt oh allah f hre mein volk denn sie haben kein wissen
6354032 m gen meine mutter und mein vater dein l segeld sein oh gesandter allahs
6354033 mein herr lasse keinen einzigen der die wahrheit zur ckweisenden auf dieser erde
6354034 teile gerecht was du hier tust ist keine aufteilung bei der es um das wohlgefallen allahs geht
6354035 befremdend ist was du da u erst wer soll denn gerecht sein wenn ich es nicht bin ich w rde versagen und w re verloren w rde ich nicht gerecht handeln
6354036 ich war mit dem propheten m ge allah ihn segnen und ihm frieden geben als er einen dicken mantel trug ein beduine riss ihn so gewaltsam an seinem mantel dass der rand des mantels einen abdruck auf seinem nacken hinterlie dann sagte er muhammad lass mich diese beiden kamele von mir mit dem eigentum allahs welches du in deinem besitz hast voll laden schlie lich wirst du mich ja nicht von deinem eigentum oder dem deines vaters laden lassen der prophet blieb ruhig und sagte dann der besitz ist der besitz von allah und ich bin sein sklave dann fragte er soll ich vergeltung an dir ben beduine f r das was du mir angetan hast er antwortete nein der prophet fragte ihn warum er dies nicht tun solle der beduine antwortete ihm weil du nie eine schlechte handlung mit einer schlechten handlung begleichst der prophet lachte und wies an dass ein kamel mit gerste und ein kamel mit datteln beladen werden sollte
6354037 we finally have enough talent on defense that we dont have to count on scoring a ton of points
6354038 we have speed maturity and were tenacious and for the first time theres depth
6354039 its the building block and springboard you want for this season
6354040 im at that point in my career where i really want to make sure we solidify ourselves as a top 20 team this year and next
6354041 i think last year we proved we could do what we have to to win games
6354042 i dont think were going to have a problem on either side of the ball
6354043 but the defense is looking like it could be the strength were a little older and developing really well
6354044 when young was out the offense controlled the ball and we led the conference in takeaways we learned how important it was to keep our offense on the field and get their offense off when camp started we were flying around like 100 000 miles an hour just playing hard and playing fast weve seen where it can take us
6354045 we like to take it one at a time and were going to do that
6354046 everything will sort itself out we feel like we owe it to ourselves to do enough to get us back to where we want and need to be
6354047 last year was tough but what we learned from that was not to leave it up to anyone else so we have to be our own committee if we win one more game then it doesnt come down to a flip of the coin

6354058 this is just one small token thats one less thing they have to worry about as far as school supplies it might not sound like a big thing but a lot of the kids cant go buy book bags and pads and pencils and stuff i want to try to eliminate at least that small part

6354062 he takes one stride and i have to take 21 2 to keep up
6354063 its ridiculous when michael johnson did it it didnt look that easy how fast can a human being go

6354095 social reformer in much the same way as margaret thatcher was an economic reformer
6354096 the thing is when youre normal for 17 years and suddenly you lose a limb youre not disabled mentally
6354097 youre still the same person so you want to do the same things youve done before
6354098 its to come from an accident and say i can still do it if i work hard i think thats the most important thing to believe in yourself to set goals and to never give up
6354099 i had a couple of people who have said to me that it would never be possible
6354100 it was actually right after i had been in the hospital and had my amputation but a dream is about what you set for yourself and not what other people set for you
6354101 it is exceedingly hard to understand just looking at her inspires you
6354102 i would go so far as to say she should be awarded a separate medal
6354103 shes an inspiration to everyone it just shows you can do what you want if you put your mind to it
6354104 but with all the americans coming the party on the fourth outgrew the embassy
6354105 the last three of four years its been held at this large resort hotel on the edge of the city
6354106 the longer tenured americans have assimilated to a degree meaning they speak chinese fluently have actual chinese friends as opposed to language partners and can generally move comfortably in chinese society
6354107 but the majority are here just to make money or enjoy the ease of expat life they speak just enough chinese to get by binge on black market dvds when theyre not in the bars and seem generally content to bounce around in their various bubbles
6354108 theyre the kind of communities that could be set down anywhere
6354109 there are pizza huts and ben amp jerrys out there for them the people that live there are commuters who might not even know theyre in china
6354110 its true there are a lot of americans in sanlitun
6354111 but whats really american about it are all the bars ten to 12 years ago the only american style bars you could find were in the hotels now theyre all over the place
6354112 despite a lot of the anti authoritarian swagger amongst americans here
6354113 many still spend quite a few of their nights in the sanlitun drinking district which the government set up in the early days of the reform period to keep foreigners ghettoized and hence easy to monitor
6354114 ive been here over six years and it used to be the one thing that most americans missed was cheese
6354115 but now there are shops where you can get almost any kind of cheese you can imagine
6354116 how a city with several passable to good french and fusion restaurants fails to produce a single edible enchilada is mystifying
6354117 that said whenever im back in the u s i long just as much for uighur food from northwestern china i hear rumors theres a few uighur restaurants in queens now but ive never been able to find them
6354118 when the ball goes too high you cant see it too easy
6354119 but its ok because if it is raining for us it is raining for them
6354120 mit 20 gr ndete sascha coldewey im jahr 2000 seinen ersten online shop f r graffiti artikel sneakersworld de und im november desselben jahres kolibrishop com einen online shop f r fashion streetwear schuhe und accessoires der internet shop wurde 2005 durch einen laden in mainz flankiert seit kurzem erg nzt die community was w rden sie aktuellen shop gr ndern mit auf den weg geben wenn man an sein produkt glaubt und ein solides konzept hat sollte man auf jeden fall durchhalteverm gen beweisen bei mir hat es etwa f nf jahre gedauert bis es zum durchbruch kam heute geht das sicherlich schneller trotzdem denke ich dass viele start ups zu fr h aufgeben oder sich nur auf ihre investoren verlassen
6354121 von den ersten bestellungen bis heute finanziert sich der kolibrishop rein aus dem cashflow
6354122 they could have built a 20 000 seat arena and filled it but they sacrificed capacity for intimacy and all these little details the fans are right on top of the action able to see it all even when there are several matches being played simultaneously
6354123 but at least they havent allowed them to bring in the drums
6354124 ping pong players are huge celebrities here they have to be whisked in and out of restaurants like movie stars or basketball stars in america
6354125 its true i have friends who once played ping pong but now they love yao and kobe bryant and the nba
6354126 fans in the u s follow baseball basketball football but when theres only one sport thats sanctioned and when the media only reports on that one sport of course its going to be the most popular
6354127 we knew that the chinese government is extremely repressive and that they might respond to any effort to get the word out about tibet strongly
6354128 so i have been stressed and worried but overall in the context of things what he is experiencing is pretty minor compared to what many people have at the hands of the chinese government
6354129 i think this is going to work out assuming it is the chinese police that have him
6354130 eat your heart out melbourne nowhere to be found melbourne will be left to compete with adelaide and brisbane and the rest of the cities we compete with the world because we are australias only global city

6354138 then im going to be waiting for the weekend because im going to crash during that time
6354139 i got a massage after the race and my masseur thought it felt great
6354140 we just didnt stick to it and once you give them a sniff its over
6354141 they can go small they can go big and theyre all good
6354142 you try to play them one way and as soon as you think youve got some stops got some momentum they just totally change the way of the game and then all of a sudden the momentum is all them
6354143 the thing we tried to do is not play like every other team and play off the dribble we tried to play with passing and cutting but they adjusted and played very hard in the second half
6354144 weve been in games in this tournament where teams have led or are tied with us at one point
6354145 you look over at the scorers bench and theyre bringing in kobe lebron and carmelo
6354146 its been a tough 4 or 5 years for us
6354147 ebay hat etwas was au er amazon so gut wie kein anderer online h ndler hat stammkunden die freiwillig immer wieder kehren
6354148 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive
6354149 as hard as you try as much as you hustle sometimes with just the landscape of the ballparks nowadays its hard to tell so if we can get it right you know what lets use it as a tool to get it right
6354150 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war

6354163 heh actually speaking of mortals immortality total immortality now there is a scary concept
6354164 what makes it worse is if everyone was offered eternal life almost all of them would take it its just a very appealing concept if you dont think about it we are talking total immortality right as in you wouldnt die no matter what youd survive any injury blah blah blah
6354165 okay well then you get to have the following treats you watch everything you ever loved fall apart and watch say that gorgeous girl you met in high school an have been with ever since
6354166 but it aint all bad i suppose i mean you still have those kids of yours even if you hate jennys husband and billy doesnt really speak to you too much anymore they are still there
6354167 of course you have to abandon your life and identity so i guess that whole thing is avoidable
6354168 during all this the world changes everyone watches the world change every generation watches their world changed and reinvented by the next now imagine this on a scale of thousands of years
6354169 nope your body forms again in space sucking on vacuume forever and ever and ever
6354170 so yeah immortality aint all its cracked up to be
6354171 d did you just come up with that on the spot or have you been rehearsing it
6354172 like will used to say every story needs an end
6354173 it is with great regret that we as founders and our board call you to urgent prayer as you may have already heard todd and shonnah bentley are experiencing some current marital difficulties and have separated god tv is anxious that our viewers and partners will first of all respond to these unfortunate circumstances with an attitude of christ like maturity and pray fervently for todd shonnah and their children as a family who are precious to the lord while we have learned today that immorality was not an issue no doubt the enemy has exploited vulnerabilities in their marriage what the devil has not counted on is the christ like maturity and intercession that is currently being raised up all across the earth in response we hope you will join us as a part of this prayer covering it is god tvs position that marriage is a foundational cornerstone to those families called to ministry and would believe that those who have spiritual oversight for todd and shonnahs ministry will recommend a time of sabbatical for the family in order to seek reconciliation within their marriage should these reports be accurate as many of you know august 8th was our final lakeland broadcast we do however believe that it is important to recognize and defend the authenticity of this outpouring by the testimonies of the countless thousands who viewed on god tv or attended at lakeland and were healed set free and delivered through jesus christ there are many churches around the uk usa and the world who are currently holding nightly revival meetings affecting whole communities once again at this time may we encourage all to pray for the family and soberly remember that all of us will be required to give account to the lord for our lives it is our earnest prayer that todd and shonnah will be fully reconciled and the board of god tv
6354174 a humdrum holocaust the third world war nobody bothered to declare
6354175 other guys will have to step up for the time that curtis is out well be fine there
6354176 we are very fortunate to sign a player of theos caliber
6354177 he is a consummate professional both on the court and off who will provide us with additional depth in the frontcourt while also serving as a mentor to some of our younger players
6354178 you may feel like ok i can go out here and sprint through my routes but thats definitely not the case youve still got some healing going on down there dont come back until youre definitely 100 percent because when you have surgery down there there are a lot of things that can go wrong
6354179 you never want to see one of your starters go out hopefully he wont be out for the whole season he can get back really quick we can hold down the fort until he gets back
6354180 i just go out there and work hard and compete and be at the highest level possible first game starting in the nfl im just hoping to go out there and make a great impression i know what im capable of doing and all the hard work ive put in the time has come and i just cant wait until friday
6354181 lets not let preseason deceive us any first he has a lot of hard work ahead of him he does show up though
6354182 i think hes going to be a pretty good player
6354183 i dont think its fair for people to look at it and say all of a sudden that hes going to be the next panthers star steve smith and compare him to some of the greats
6354184 you have to give people an opportunity to get adjusted in this league
6354185 hes made catches with the 1s and the 2s obviously hes getting open
6354186 there were plays where the ball was not thrown right and he was still open hes definitely learning the offense the guys hot you go with him thats just another weapon
6354187 im confident in jackson and his athletic ability and what he can do for this offense i cant say if its overwhelming or unrealistic or what not because im not desean i dont know how he feels about it im confident in him going out there and doing what he did in college just coming out and continuing what hes done in the preseason making plays and getting better each and every week
6354188 we won three straight last october ive tried to teach our guys that successful teams do it over the course of 4 or 5 months they certainly understand what it takes and how quickly it can be taken away from you
6354189 its about focusing on the process if you can learn that the wins take care of itself everybody wants to quantify what a successful season is if these guys can achieve competitive greatness give themselves opportunities to win games theyre going to win more than their share
6354190 coach sends a really strong message that you cant be inconsistent
6354191 you cant be lazy with your practice schedule one week and go hard the next thatll come back to bite you
6354192 when we came here they laughed at us when we walked around campus right now theres a little buzz you can just feel the energy around us there are a lot of expectations we cant wait to get started
6354193 you see the predictions you just try not to read into that too much it would mean so much to leave on a good note especially after all the things weve been through i couldnt even put that into words
6354194 when we first came here i didnt really look too much into the future

6354204 has taken steps to address the issues and concerns that were raised in the internal audit
6354205 youve got to take care of the ball a little more
6354206 its their team theyre going to make decisions that they think are best and marvin and the players and all the coaches do the best with what weve got
6354207 you didnt have to give up the farm system to go get a guy
6354208 when im on the mound i dont try to think too much about anything i dont even know what my name is all i try to do is concentrate on chris costes mitt and where i want to throw the pitch and what pitch i want to throw
6354209 is it real is it real did i really win gold
6354210 to tell you the truth i just want to chill out right now
6354211 i want to sleep i wish i was in sandals right now
6354212 hes lively hes fun he plays to the crowd i mean his last names bolt and hes only 21
6354213 right now in jamaica the rum is flowing and the reggae is playing
6354214 we have the best coffee in the world we had bob marley who gave the world a new religion
6354215 and we have usain bolt he means so much in every corner of jamaica every man every woman every child
6354216 hes got to get to 26 27 28 before he hits his prime
6354217 this is a fast track i told myself that if im going to get that world record im going to get it here
6354218 i knew i would go that fast ive been running fast times and shutting down at the end
6354219 he just felt tight after the game and it was bothering him
6354220 we checked it out its one of those situations where if you can go you go if you cant then you have to have the surgery he tried it and he cant do that so weve moved on
6354221 a player can function or cant function and right now kevin cant function we know kevins a very tough guy and he was trying but he was just not able to get open out there
6354222 it feels like someone has stabbed you in the abdominal area its excruciating pain i dont know how you can play through it probably the smartest decision you can make is to fix it
6354223 he is coming off a heck of a season if his play drops he is not going to go to the media and say im hurt hes a stand up guy and will say im not doing the job the organization lets him get it fixed so he can be mentally back
6354224 after you get surgery you will feel 100 times better and youre going to feel you can work out and start routes be running and try to rehab but dont push it too soon
6354225 they were all going to play anyway so theyll play a little bit more now
6354226 i just hope to go out there and make a great impression
6354227 i dont see it as having to make up for anything
6354228 last year was last year this is a brand new year nobody has any yards anywhere we have to come out and do what we have to do our offense will continue to flourish were capable of getting better and making plays

6354235 god is not the god of the dead but of the living
6354236 its not painful where i cant play i feel good to go
6354237 that might take him a while to get settled because of who he is his makeup and how he goes about things hes quiet
6354238 i think hes pretty much available until we see something different
6354239 i think his fastball command has been as good as its been all year and hes back to being pretty economical as far as the number of pitches hes throwing per inning
6354240 if he wasnt able to throw a strike when he had to then id be worried about his delivery and his mechanics
6354241 for me the approach has been all wrong he hasnt been focused on staying down in the strike zone he hasnt been focused on getting contact on the ground early in counts and thats who he is hes pitched too cautiously hes a contact ground ball guy
6354242 all year long weve been trying to preserve what weve got here
6354243 i dont want the fans to get on him about my situation
6354244 he kind of just got thrown into this whole thing things dont need to be directed at him and i wanted that to be known
6354245 its hard to say it that way when you say my name fast
6354246 coach reid has enough trust in me and confidence like i said i didnt know where i was going to be once i got back with my teammates
6354247 once i got back with my teammates i was thinking if they put me second group or third group i would follow suit and work my way back up
6354248 i really didnt have a clue you can go out and practice and it can be one thing and they say hey youre not going to play you have to do your job
6354249 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6354250 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6354251 i think another week of practice will definitely move me over the edge and ill be ready for the regular season
6354252 however i have been away from the guys and havent struggled with them or sweated with them i feel bad about that but i practiced this week and felt pretty good i think i am getting the trust from my teammates and offensive line back
6354253 he is going to take two or three steps forward and one back on occasion max is a fine player i think you win games with players like max
6354254 youre telling me i cant wear the same mask ive used for 3 years
6354255 isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is going for it thats our approach its pedal to the metal
6354256 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now

6354341 at reception scott morris was taking a call he told the defendant he wouldnt be a moment and to take a seat
6354342 mr morris then had to leave the reception momentarily but indicated he would be back quickly
6354343 mr morris warned the defendant that he would call security and asked if the words were being directed at him
6354344 at this point a health care assistant came to reception and the defendant swore when telling her the man had been on the phone and was ignoring him
6354345 she said the defendant had his finger constantly pressed on the bell
6354346 when she asked him to take a seat the defendant became very agitated he came so close their faces were touching
6354347 he then shouted listen white bitch ill sit down when i want to sit down
6354348 she said he lifted his left hand above his head and she believed he was about to hit her
6354349 a security guard tried to deal with the incident he said the defendant was gesturing with his fingers in the shape of a gun saying ill come back and shoot you

6354352 this is a crime without a victim with evidence from someone who admitted they didnt really hear what was happening and who had already had an award for reporting the case before she stepped into court

6354371 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6354372 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6354373 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6354374 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

6354376 america was a big winner at the awards and a big winner on the style front in this striking dress i think its one of the best pictures ive ever seen of her she always looks really chic and knows what is flattering for her body but its nice to see her in something young and fun ive seen her in a lot of long gowns which can sometimes make her look older than she is this graphic black and white print is fun but its also sophisticated and i like the way the style defines her waist its fitted in all of the right places and accentuates her best features shes got really nice shoulders and in a lot of the images that ive looked at where shes wearing long dresses she does something with a sweetheart neck which is flattering for her upper body but shes someone who can really carry off strapless too skimping on accessories was the right move the dress has a bold pattern so she didnt need to add much just an elegant earring and a sexy pair of heels whoever did her hair and makeup should do it every single day because it works perfectly her skin looks glowy and her hair is a little bit looser a little bit less done which looks really pretty this is definitely a home run
6354377 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6354378 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6354379 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6354380 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6354381 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6354382 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6354383 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6354384 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6354385 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6354386 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6354387 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6354388 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6354389 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6354390 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6354391 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6354392 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6354393 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6354394 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
6354395 there is now a major awareness on health in the industry and through cfdas continued programs there had been a real coming together with an emphasis on health as beauty

6354401 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6354402 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6354403 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6354404 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6354407 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6354408 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

6354420 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6354421 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6354422 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6354423 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

6354453 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6354454 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6354478 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6354479 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6354480 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6354481 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6354482 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6354483 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6354484 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6354485 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6354486 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6354487 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6354488 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6354489 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6354490 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6354491 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6354492 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6354493 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6354494 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6354498 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6354499 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6354500 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6354501 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6354507 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6354508 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6354509 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6354510 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6354511 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6354512 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6354513 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6354514 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6354515 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6354522 i like the idea of transferring my body into creatures that arent even human i like putting myself so far out of the box people cant help but notice maybe i was dropped on my head too many times as a child

6354524 i discovered that you can literally duct tape and glue anything to your body

6354529 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto

6354532 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6354533 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6354534 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6354535 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6354536 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6354537 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6354538 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6354539 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6354540 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6354541 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6354565 the seamless shift gearbox will really be our last development for 2008 and we will now shift our focus to 2009 in the second part of the year there will however still be opportunities up for grabs and we need to look to maximise them now really what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us we need to look for a 100 reliability rate to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6354566 although 2009 is a big opportunity there are still points up for grabs this year weve got some good potential chances coming up and if we take our eye off the ball we could miss out on getting some good finishes that said work for 2009 will step up immensely towards the end of the season so we can make sure we are ready
6354567 yes of course i think valencia should be a great venue for a race like a little monaco ive seen the plans for the circuit and it looks like it should pass through some of the newest parts of the city i think it should be some sight to see the cars going past the marina and the boats very reminiscent of the principality i think it will be a great event for the team fans and sponsors
6354568 the three week break is actually an opportunity for the race team to take some time off as its been a very busy few months with the testing and racing with the season being 18 races this year its a long season and its good to take time off while its a bit quieter we didnt completely shut down though following the tests and running of the seamless shift box in hungary weve gone over the data and are making sure we are fully prepared for its introduction under race conditions in valencia we also took part in the rotterdam racing event which was great fun for the team and the drivers
6354569 f1 needs to keep itself fresh so of course its good to introduce it to new markets with new potential marketing and commercial opportunities although spain has long had a race this is a completely new venture for the sport with a street race round a very recognisable vibrant city looking to make its mark on the world stage as such its an opportunity to attract new brands and fans into the sport
6354570 i think i wont be alone in saying everyone loves street races as they are much more immediate seeing how fast the cars can get on the streets you drive every day really puts the speed and the accuracy needed into perspective the races are also much more unpredictable as the guardrails are so close so anything could happen i think valencia could become a real classic
6354571 we tested the gearbox for the first time at a shakedown in silverstone and then again for three days in jerez but for such an important component it really isnt enough to be able to validate it running it on friday in hungary gave the opportunity to conduct further testing plus we avoided the penalties of changing gearboxes in the middle of a four race cycle the boxes we used in hungary were three races into the four race cycle and changing them would have incurred a grid penalty it made sense to put some more miles on it then use when we are at the start of another four race cycle
6354572 our simulations typically show a benefit of two to three tenths over one lap and possibly more as the driver has the option to get on the power earlier as the car isnt upset by the gear change the driver can therefore be much smoother with the acceleration so there is less disturbance when cornering and under power we will see an advantage everywhere as you will always ratio the gearbox to get the most out of it at each circuit so its effect over a lap will be fairly consistent from circuit to circuit
6354573 with its limited resources the team has done a very good job to get it introduced this season it is a big thing for a small team to introduce such a large component mid season as we dont have the transient dynos and test rigs that the other teams have really we were only able to start work on the box when we became force india and had reasonable levels of budgets and resources to make it work from an engineering point of view the team has done an excellent job to get it ready on time and the gearbox department has done well to make the introduction of the seamless box almost seamless in itself
6354574 of course there are always risks associated with introducing a gearbox mid season due to the limited mileage but i think this was a step the team has had to make for the future the first box we ran got to over three race event distances before stopping with a very minor problem so a very very good effort in terms of reliability obviously we will be fixing the small problems we have seen but i think we should be able to cope with this
6354575 weve not been able to introduce it previously purely due to a resource and finance issue we didnt have either the engineering resources or the budget to be able to take the risk to introduce it and its only now as force india that we have everything in place to be able to make it work in terms of the actual project however its been very well done and pushed through which is in itself a measure of the growing strength of the team
6354576 going to new circuits presents a different challenge for the team but its an interesting challenge for the engineers as well as the drivers and valencia in itself will be a fascinating and unique event in terms of preparation we obviously look at the track layout and put this into our computer simulations so we have a fair idea of the nature of the circuit there are some things you cant understand from the computers however specifically the nature of the tarmac how the tyres are going to react whether you can use the kerbs or not and so on are all unknown quantities until we get to the track its a good challenge though and will keep us busy
6354577 over the summer break ive been training in the mountains and working on my fitness for the second half of the year which will be tough with the four flyaway races at the end of the season
6354578 looking to the next race in valencia we will be using the seamless shift gearbox for the first time at a race and hopefully that will give us a few tenths to be able to qualify a bit better this has got to be the goal for the second half of the year
6354579 i am looking forward to getting back in the car after the short break
6354580 valencia is a completely new track for everyone and a good challenge

6354639 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6354640 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6354641 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6354642 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6354643 having nine kids and a job thats hard this is easy its a life that a lot of people would like to have its tough playing every day but thats just part of the game
6354644 its been quite a ride especially with the ups and primarily the downs that ive had
6354645 it just makes it that much more satisfying to have some success up here last year i was ready for it to be over and just forget about the whole thing this year maybe in the off season i can ponder on some of the successes that ive had
6354646 cito inserted him in the lineup as soon as they brought him back he started to get a couple of hits here hits there and with cito and i talking to him and working with him the confidence started to come into the picture the swing has been there we didnt build the swing
6354647 you see a rod walk away from the plate taking strike three vs a j burnett on tuesday
6354648 it was a great breaking ball but you can believe he was looking for something else and here youre talking about a hall of famer he has a plan when he goes up there and thats what we like to get our guys doing too have a plan when you walk up there if you fail walk away like a rod did
6354649 since ive been here he has a plan when he walks to that plate and he pretty much sticks to it
6354650 once in a while hell stray a little but like ive said you stray seven out of 10 times and youre still a star this kids got a chance to be special
6354651 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music
6354652 it depends on my surroundings if i were at home it wouldnt be
6354653 ive read about headphones causing pressure on the eardrums but i cant live without my music
6354654 at the end of the day all that matters is the length of time exposed to a certain level of volume
6354655 the general rule of thumb is if youre done with something and theres ringing in the ears youve done some damage and it accumulates over time once youve done that damage youre susceptible to even more damage
6354656 there will be nights where ill fall asleep with my ipod on
6354657 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad

6354659 three points in our pocket thats how we looked at it
6354660 we lost two points at home and now we have to play against honduras who are considered the third best in concacaf behind mexico and the u s
6354661 i feel like i let the guys down that was the only mistake i made
6354662 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6354663 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6354664 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6354665 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6354666 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6354667 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6354668 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6354669 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6354670 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6354671 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6354672 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6354673 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6354674 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6354675 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6354676 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6354677 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6354678 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6354679 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6354680 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6354681 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6354682 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6354683 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6354684 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6354685 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6354686 invocando la protecci n de dios fuente de toda raz n y justicia
6354687 y as pa no morir de hambre buscaban los animales de los men ndez por eso los mataba men ndez
6354688 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

6354691 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6354692 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6354693 this was going to be an april fools gag but i chickened out at the last minute i had an elaborate plan which involved getting several comic and film websites to help out with the hoax and post this claiming to be a leaked still from the dark knight with info from a wb insider detailing that the harley quinn cameo was the big twist in the films end and that kristen bell was only on set for one day as she only had 2 scenes to shoot the beauty part would have been that as australia gets april fools day first it would have been posted march 31 us time so suspicion would have been minimal alas the fear of a world wide backlash stopped me from going through with it
6354694 basically the only reference i used indeed the only reference i had for a long time was the profile shot of the new outfit release a few months back it was all pretty much guess work and when those leaked pics got out on the net a while ago i was finally able to tweak the design even further this is the most complex thing ive ever created something like 300 layers were used lots of custom pieces countless hours in my spare time the result is 1000 times better than the original batgirl i did before infact it pains me to look at that one anne hathaway is the model
6354695 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6354696 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6354697 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6354698 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6354699 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6354700 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6354701 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6354702 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6354703 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6354704 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6354705 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6354706 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6354707 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6354717 this year things have been very different you know young girls with the raging hormones trying to meet boys in the summertime theyre usually half naked this year though ive noticed the theme is proper dresses cinched waists little collars puff sleeves these are 18 19 20 year old girls and theyre wearing what we would have called housedresses in the 50s and 60s
6354718 the idea is the sleeves will be looser the overall look less fitted and strict but very feminine and flowing
6354719 im not a huge fan of prissy so i suggest a strong look
6354720 were getting dressed up a little more were interested in being women again
6354721 this is not throwaway fashion this is something more substantial

6354723 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6354724 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6354725 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6354726 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6354727 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6354728 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6354729 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6354730 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6354731 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6354732 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6354733 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6354734 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6354735 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6354736 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6354737 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6354738 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

6354743 that was a good day let me tell you to finally put a close to it
6354744 i dont consider myself an alcoholic and i never will consider myself an alcoholic but i got in trouble because of alcohol and to me thats a problem i had to change things in my life so i changed them
6354745 i was ashamed of what i did when it first happened and embarrassed all the emotions that came along with it but you know what it happened i made a mistake at the same time ive been through a lot and ive overcome a lot im actually very proud of myself for what ive overcome
6354746 no one really bothered me even if they did know who i was theyd just ask what it was like to play in the nhl thats about it
6354747 i met some people that did the same thing i did they just messed up others you just steered clear of

6354749 the cooperation agreement with dong energy provides us with the chance to develop projects that combine co2 reductions with economic and social advantages for poor and vulnerable people in ghana and vietnam thus we are positive towards testing the new options that the carbon markets provide to finance our work
6354750 we are delighted to be able to cooperate with care danmark on activities which improve living conditions for people in poor local communities we hope that the agreement will herald the start of a number of climate projects that prove sustainable in the long term

6354754 together with ats ganymed is pursuing a long term development strategy and a substantial expansion of our antibody pipeline to include a broad portfolio of development candidates for the treatment of solid cancers
6354755 over the last year we have been very impressed with ganymeds exceptional team who are together with a very promising pipeline the justification for our long term confidence in ganymed we see this offer as a logical step to further expand the large developmental potential of ganymed and set the company upon a solid basis
6354756 we are very proud of what has been achieved with the syndicate of early investors financial strategic and operational support together with the ganymed team over a period of otherwise economically difficult years
6354757 the global credit crunch has tightened the availability of banking finance forcing investors in india and worldwide to reach out to private equity funds as an alternative source of funding their capital investment expansion programs despite indias recent weakened economic outlook and inflation at a 13 year high the infrastructure sector continues to attract global equity funds
6354758 additionally india is realizing increased interest from offshore money which will be invested into the national infrastructure program over the next five to seven years
6354759 the driving motivation for foreign direct investment inflows into india continues to be double tax treaties associated with offshore jurisdictions private equity funds establish wholly owned subsidiaries in offshore jurisdictions to invest into the indian target company
6354760 clients of walkers hong kong office have established special purpose vehicles spvs in the cayman islands and british virgin islands to operate as holding companies for investments into india these spvs typically invest into underlying indian investee companies via a wholly owned subsidiary established in a country that has a double tax treaty with india namely mauritius singapore or cyprus by creating an offshore holding structure the private equity fund may avoid transferability restrictions on an eventual exit from the underlying investment
6354761 private equity funds are extremely keen to identify and invest in growth opportunities in the indian pre ipo market this enthusiasm coupled with a lack of viable investment opportunities in other markets has made private equity financing an easier source of capital than financial institutions that are scaling back their lending activities in emerging markets
6354762 however private equitys insistence on taking quasi management positions within the investee companies can be perceived as an encroachment on the funded companys ability to independently control the growth and direction of the business this can often lead to a focus on short to medium term growth to facilitate an exit for the private equity fund not longer term strategies
6354763 while india does present some challenges due to the strict restrictions of the indian companies act 1956 and the material regulatory barriers if a fund investing in india is not a member of iosco we anticipate continued interest in india and more activity from india investors
6354764 by working with a sophisticated law firm that has vast experience both in private equity funds and in the asian markets institutional investors and global financial organizations can leverage the power of this emerging market

6354775 with this initiative executive education at the uct gsb is giving anyone with an internet connection and an interest in business an opportunity to engage with the experience knowledge and cutting edge research of top academics this is a level of public engagement that very few top business schools in the world can match
6354776 on one level it is an innovative knowledge management system which places valuable information in a central place as a resource for others including those interested in finding out more about the issues dealt with on uct gsb courses and who want to interact with faculty before they decide to embark on a programme it also allows those who complete uct gsb courses to sustain dialogue and explore ideas once they emerge from the training

6354785 ive been here for five years and this is the first time there has been no maize
6354786 if they say theres hunger then its caused by the people themselves who dont know how to manage what they produce

6354808 the 15 year programme will ensure that the uk has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6354809 it is absolutely essential to the conduct of operations and training that we have a guaranteed uk based high quality source of ammunition this contract provides precisely that

6354813 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6354814 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6354815 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6354816 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6354829 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6354830 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6354837 when i executed i got outs i got out of situations but mostly i was trying to do too much rushing my mechanics i was trying to get them all out myself
6354838 but once again it doesnt matter who youre pitching against you still have to pitch ahead in the count if you dont they just sit on your fastball
6354839 teams like the yankees and boston theyll work a pitcher they work the count and they work it the right way they dont work it taking strikes they work it taking balls
6354840 theyve all got to pitch well weve got to have a couple more weeks like last week when they went 5 1 in detroit and boston

6354844 my view is that you either have deregulated trading or you dont
6354845 what weve got is an absolute hash theres no rhyme or reason to it its all politically driven i think
6354846 consumers are paying hundreds of dollars more per annum in wa because we dont have deregulated trading hours
6354847 its poor policy i think its poor leadership on retail trading hours i think customers should have the choice
6354848 if theres not a woolworths or a coles in town you pay 17 per cent more

6354877 you dont raise 45 million and then get shut down that doesnt make sense

6354883 there is no single business model to cater to the bottom of the social pyramid traditional mindset is to go to markets where there is money and not create opportunities in emerging markets
6354884 globalisation is a reality today and cannot be wished away
6354885 there are 4 billion underserved persons in the world and theres a need to provide this emerging market the benefits of globalisation
6354886 create micro consumers and micro producers along with micro investors and micro innovators if we are to achieve this goal
6354887 the underlying aim is to provide products with global standards and locally responsive solutions
6354888 if we can do this in the field of connectivity why should not we able to be successful in other core fields like health energy education water and micro finance
6354889 we always think of going into a market where money is not where we can create a market and this has to change
6354890 we have to think away from the traditional business strategy of cost plus profit is equal to price the new way to reach out is to think in terms of target price minus target profit is equal to cost
6354891 the public private and ngo sectors have to work together to achieve this goal

6354898 the negotiators have made really really good progress they are satisfied with where they are
6354899 but obviously it is going to be the prime ministers call so this is a chance for me to sit there with him

6354908 i am pleased with our performance in the first half of 2008 we have increased our market share and as a result i can report strong growth in savings and mortgages
6354909 theres no doubt that this is a tough climate for mortgage lenders
6354910 however our ability to attract and retain retail savings and our consistent focus over many years on low risk lending means we have been able to meet the challenges that we have faced these results testify that coventry building society is in good shape
6354911 especially when it was her father who created the original show
6354912 he told her that they should have worked something out before she made an abrupt decision because now he cant even be on the show
6354913 i hope it turns out to be a really great show just for my dads legacy i was originally a part of 90210 and it was something pretty phenomenal so i hope it turns out great
6354914 he is working all the time so scarlett wants to hold off until the election is over
6354915 dad im fine really the doctor said it was best to keep active all ive been doing is sanding the woodwork and
6354916 ah thatll be whats set the carpal tunnel off i expect
6354917 sounds exactly like it to me theres quite a few things you can try without tablets and operations though splints ultrasound all sorts they didnt work for me but everyones different hopefully youll be lucky
6354918 yours is better now youve had the op isnt it
6354919 much better than it was i can do everything i could before but it still aches a bit and sometimes i get the tingling someone told me that taking b6 tablets helps so ive got myself some of them ive only been taking them for two days though so its too early to say if they work
6354920 im sure this is carpal tunnel syndrome the pins and needles in the index and middle fingers and then spreading to the thumb and ring finger followed by aching in these fingers is the common pattern of symptoms for some reason it does occasionally occur during pregnancy if youre lucky this might be only temporary
6354921 it gets the name from the carpal bones in the wrist a ligament lies across the front of the wrist forming a space called the carpal tunnel tendons that attach the forearm muscles to the fingers pass through the tunnel as does a main nerve to the hand this median nerve gives feeling to the thumb index and middle fingers and half of the ring finger it also controls the movement to the small muscles at the base of the thumb carpal tunnel syndrome is a set of symptoms caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel
6354922 no it is reasonably common though about one in 1000 people develop it each year most cases occur in people in their 40s and 50s but it can occur at any age it is also common during pregnancy women are affected more often than men
6354923 you said it could be just because im pregnant will i have this throughout my pregnancy and what can i do about it what happens if its not treated
6354924 symptoms tend to come and go at first often after you use the hand typically symptoms are worse at night and may wake you up if you were overweight then losing some weight might help but im not suggesting that in your case the symptoms may be eased for a while by raising the hand or allowing it to hang down and its sensible not to over use the wrist flicking the wrist may also give temporary relief
6354925 symptoms can persist all the time if the condition becomes severe the pain may travel up the forearm numbness of the same fingers or in part of the palm may develop in the most severe cases the muscles in the fingers or thumb may become weak this may cause poor grip and eventually lead to wasting of the muscles at the base of the thumb one or both hands may be affected
6354926 thats not the same thing as muscle damage if we can relieve the pain then you should soon be able to do everything you could before
6354927 in most cases it is not clear why it occurs its thought that inflammation develops in a tendon going through the carpal tunnel which causes swelling which may lead to pressure on the nearby median nerve the inflammation can occur if you over use your hand its much more common in manual workers especially those who have a job involving a lot of wrist movement such as scrubbing or wringing
6354928 conditions of the wrist such as rheumatoid arthritis or wrist fractures may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome there are other associated conditions for example pregnancy obesity an under active thyroid diabetes or menopause it could be because some of these cause water retention which may affect the wrist and cause carpal tunnel syndrome some other rare conditions may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome
6354929 my dad said he had a test will i need that
6354930 a nerve conduction test is often used to confirm the diagnosis but in your case the symptoms are so typical that combined with your pregnancy i dont think that will be needed
6354931 apart from the flicking thing what other treatments are there
6354932 for you i think the best option is no treatment many occurrences that begin in pregnancy go again after the birth even in non pregnant patients the symptoms can sometimes just go if it doesnt improve then of course well review the situation
6354933 painkillers to ease the pain would be the first step if the condition appeared to be connected with another medical condition then treatment of that condition would probably help steroid injections to reduce inflammation can be very effective these are given close to the nerve
6354934 an anaesthetic is used to make it painless another option is a course of steroid tablets if the steroids didnt relieve symptoms then surgery would be considered
6354935 my dad had an op and he says his wrist is much better he said something about ultrasound and splints are they still used
6354936 yes in fact you could try a splint at night to rest the wrist i could prescribe one if you like
6354937 ultrasound treatment which is painless has been reported to ease symptoms in some cases it isnt clear how this works but it may help to reduce inflammation unfortunately it isnt available on the nhs in this area thats probably because twenty or so sessions are required and so its expensive
6354938 non surgical treatments would normally be tried first especially for mild or intermittent symptoms if that doesnt work then you or any other patient should return to their gp
6354939 possibly or to try another treatment its also important to go back if theres constant numbness as untreated this could result in permanent nerve damage
6354940 a small cut of the ligament over the front of the wrist eases the pressure in the carpal tunnel its usually done under local anaesthetic and takes only a few minutes the patient can be using their hand again for work in a couple of weeks and will only have a small scar
6354941 ok i believe you but i still hope i dont need to have it done
6354942 he didnt exercise sufficient care in his work with the office to avoid getting in a mess like that
6354943 i dont think this proposal will solve it its a bad idea
6354944 as i welcome my new son to my family i am even more committed to ensuring that he lives in a city where health is among san joses top priorities
6354945 it is about our children its about our future what we are asking is to get the dialogue started we must do something to eliminate this
6354946 we believe a fast food moratorium would be a real detriment to our community

6354954 this happened at a time when it would have still been light and it may well be that someone else came across this man but didnt report it
6354955 i would urge anyone who was approached by this man or saw someone fitting the description in the caversham area at the time of the incident to contact me
6354956 residents took a keen interest in the previous consultation and i hope the further improvements under consideration will generate a good response this time

6354960 that is typical when pilots are flying in uncontrolled airspace in good weather
6354961 an acute care hospital which will continue to provide for the health care needs of the entire community
6354962 when i first heard about the possibility of being allowed to protest i was very happy my issue could be resolved but it turned out all to be cheating i feel stuck in my heart
6354963 what the two old ladies did is nowhere near that
6354964 republicans must step out of their ideological corner on the right and democrats must step out of their ideological corner on the left
6354965 i dont really view this as anything different than what hes been saying for a couple of months
6354966 it would have been nice if it had been a few months ago

6354969 small missile threats of the kind that iran or north korea might impose and not aimed in any way at russia
6354970 i think justice was served for the boy and for his mother
6354971 and the family is relieved that its come to a conclusion and they can move forward the boy is in a safe environment and i hope for the best for him
6354972 every time she tried to get away he beat her
6354973 she had the same type of burns her child had
6354974 we thought that was appropriate under the circumstances and was sufficient to hold him accountable and to punish him for the horrible acts against the child and the mother
6354975 all the people that have stepped into his life really appreciate all the donations
6354976 it will enrich his life and assist him in his life he is pretty much left with nothing but this trust fund
6354977 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6354978 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6354979 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6354980 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6354981 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6354982 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6354983 i couldve been to the pro bowl instead of dropping about 10 picks
6354984 i was starting to have a really good season last year then came the injury now im back so i need to have a really good year im anxious to go out there and show the real carlos
6354985 i was khary for a little minute but you guys got me
6354986 i spent seven years there from the age of nine and the coaching overseen by alex ferguson was faultless
6354987 it helped make me the player i am and if staying at shrewsbury can help my west brom career then great
6354988 the ferguson way was clearly passed down through all his coaching staff so you knew what to expect as you climbed the ladder
6354989 its the fall of bay meadows and the rise of condominiums
6354990 weve done so many auctions the stardust casino in vegas blockbuster videos biotech companies
6354991 but this one is different usually we just do our job and get out
6354992 my life is completely different because i worked at this racetrack
6354993 in the end not many students got charged so what was the point
6354994 why target san diego state im sure this stuff happens in the ivy league too

6355000 attractive characters written by happo bijin as a base participated companies added things by creating a product the work as well as its characters improved its a new kind of collaboration project
6355001 theres a pretty widespread belief that this is an antiquated system
6355002 its analogous to saying lets take a class of high school kids who have never held a basketball give them 30 hours in the classroom and six hours hands on and say now we have taught you to play basketball
6355003 there are a number of other states that have cut their programs and are regretting it
6355004 i think a law needs to be passed that the parents have to log a certain number of hours driving with their children
6355005 i was surprised when i first heard that now ive just accepted that its not worth much
6355006 you dont know how dangerous it is and thats the scary part
6355007 especially with never really having been in a game with him for an extensive period of time especially this week it was imperative that i get out there get some work done try to see how hes seeing the game how hes going to be viewing the defense and things like that
6355008 he is what that whole group needs to look like that starts with donald driver greg and i think ruvell martin has done a great job adding to that james jones is a year better and i think jordy nelson is falling in line
6355009 not only are they good players smart players but they play every position they give you the ability to match up and create mismatches across the board when you get into multi receiver sets greg is someone well try to utilize even more this year
6355010 with greg back it probably takes a little pressure off because youve got to kind of pick your poison
6355011 you double cover donald well go after greg you double greg well go to donald
6355012 hell be one of the guys that ill evaluate as the game goes on
6355013 chemistry wise were on the same page i think weve worked enough the last two years and in the offseason program but its going to be nice in the flow of the game to be able to look his way a little bit im not worried about chemistry between him and i
6355014 i wasnt a part of it but i am a part of it it wasnt fun to watch and i guarantee it wasnt fun to be a part of you know thats just one of those downs that teams go through and were just glad we went through it in preseason
6355015 when youre dealing with guys that like to run after the catch sometimes that run after the catch gets before the actual catch you get your eyes off the ball that split second before it touches your hand and thats when drops occur but its not something that were not used to doing we drop balls but really dont drop them probably to the extent of what weve been doing lately well correct it i promise you that
6355016 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a
6355017 the explosion occurred in a vacant car left at the blast scene we believe the blast was the result of plastic explosives set off by remote control
6355018 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos
6355019 information gathered following a recent attack by militants on international security assistance forces isaf in that area

6355042 i love horses ive learned from them just watch how a horse walks it does it without self consciousness
6355043 ive seen so much so much human self consciousness since an early age in this business of acting in truth actors are possibly the most self conscious people on earth
6355044 but watching horses and riding horses ive learned a lot about nature about being natural once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself
6355045 a horse is after all a pretty large animal when you can mount it and move it and move along with it that is a hard won and very real accomplishment
6355046 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
6355047 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
6355048 and i said wouldnt it be something if i killed this individual i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time

6355058 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team
6355059 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year
6355060 we might not be able to cope but you have a better chance if you have the people in

6355093 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6355094 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6355095 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6355096 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6355097 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6355098 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6355099 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6355100 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6355101 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6355103 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6355104 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6355105 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

6355137 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6355138 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6355139 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6355140 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6355141 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6355142 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6355143 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6355144 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6355145 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6355146 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6355147 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6355148 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6355149 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6355150 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6355151 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6355152 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6355153 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6355154 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6355155 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6355156 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6355157 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6355158 if its a really bad day sick boy himself will be behind the bar serving with a snarl
6355159 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6355160 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6355161 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6355162 this is a planning took where all things are going
6355163 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6355164 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6355165 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6355166 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6355167 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6355168 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6355169 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6355170 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6355171 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6355172 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6355173 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6355174 for me to come to the olympics games has been a dream come true
6355175 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6355176 the workers have a right to refuse to treat you
6355177 and if they came back and said that they didnt want to come back because i was black
6355178 according to triumph this is my workplace and according to beacon who is allowing people to not return because i am epileptic this is their workspace for which i am liable
6355179 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6355180 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6355181 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6355182 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6355183 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6355184 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6355185 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6355186 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6355187 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

6355201 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6355202 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6355203 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6355204 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6355205 eighteen people three principals and 15 accomplices were charged with assassinating five they are said to have been part of a terror machine working for the establishment the accused are described routinely in the iranian media as rogue elements of the intelligence ministry they were led by saeed imami a senior ministry official reported to have committed suicide in detention in june 1999 by drinking hair remover while having a bath
6355206 invitation first that is call them first to embrace islam if they refuse then war
6355207 in the last days of the world there will appear young people with foolish thoughts and ideas
6355208 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6355209 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
6355210 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
6355211 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
6355212 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6355213 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6355214 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6355215 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
6355216 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
6355217 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
6355218 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6355219 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6355220 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

6355230 3par utility storage and its 3cv blueprint provide the agility flexibility and scalability required by a dynamic and growing web 2 0 business
6355231 demand media is one of many web 2 0 companies re evaluating their storage environments to prepare for high levels of growth
6355232 we are very pleased that they have selected 3par utility storage to support their new virtual datacenter and their rapidly growing sql server database environment
6355233 i triple check and test all our online gaming for the greater society website code many times before we launch a beta version for the marketing team to check the more people that test the website before the publish date the better since this is a great way to find any bugs that might throw a wrench in the works
6355234 i find that the customer can get more value for their money with linux
6355235 since linux provides many possible platforms customizations database options and programming language compatibilities
6355236 also dont rule out the importance of your database language
6355237 we find that mysql works best in most all cases and provides the flexibility and reliability that we need for our intensive website creations
6355238 i like to keep all pages to w3c html standards so that crawling by robots and human use is as errorless as possible
6355239 they are by far more skilled and less expensive than hiring a specialty in house staff for a online gaming for the greater society project as a result we just need a couple in house designers to help maintain the website after it is built and take care of odd jobs
6355240 while gradients and various hues and tones look cool on screen they dont reproduce well on a mug letterhead or stationary
6355241 because the webmaster sees the site everyday but the customer only sees it once or twice
6355242 many online gaming for the greater society affiliate programs take care of designing and providing an abundant number of creatives for their webmasters which saves affiliate publishers a lot of time
6355243 now that macau is beginning to attract world class casino brands our only real competition is the
6355244 i think the potential for success marketing gaming club casino in most all countries so why not casino games
6355245 friendlies are a bit different but it was good to be playing centre back it was only my second time for northern ireland
6355246 we were here to do a job and its a good platform to take into the qualifiers going away from home and keeping a clean sheet if that was a qualifying match we would have got a valuable point
6355247 you always get the work rate with northern ireland but with that system we worked really really hard
6355248 with the two wide men and david healy playing up on his own he worked his socks off
6355249 it will be cpi but the modalities and details still have to be worked out
6355250 i cant say whether the target range will change but we believe that a range of 3 to 6 percent still offers a lot of room to benefit economic growth
6355251 averaging out growth for the first two quarters of this year it is highly unlikely that the sa economy will experience recession
6355252 the credit squeeze is still very much in evidence in the us with the fed federal reserve rapidly running out of firepower to combat an economic downturn all this considered the sa economy has had it pretty good

6355260 i spent seven years there from the age of nine and the coaching overseen by alex ferguson was faultless
6355261 it helped make me the player i am and if staying at shrewsbury can help my west brom career then great
6355262 the ferguson way was clearly passed down through all his coaching staff so you knew what to expect as you climbed the ladder
6355263 no vimos nada que se pareciera a un avi n s lo trozos de personas y varios ni os totalmente calcinados
6355264 at present we are training for the match with gabala team most changes may take place after the game if the team will lose the game the coach will have to resign this practice is used in most countries

6355266 so far such an incident has not taken place at facilities under our control

6355268 the geneva convention allows prisoners on the battle field not in uniform to be shot would you rather that or detention
6355269 well you may have tortured this person and held them for years without any legal recourse but you didnt shoot them so well done not guilty
6355270 we want to make it clear that we are in the solid state business

6355273 i am sure that georgia will become member of the north atlantic alliance
6355274 the nato member states from europe are at the moment trying to avoid diplomatic irritations with russia as membership of georgia would be considered a diplomatic affront by russia especially european members are not pushing for it now
6355275 european member states are more hesitant as for them good relations with russia are of great interest
6355276 since the eu precludes the russians from having such a sphere in the baltic state or in eastern europe they are content to sacrifice the caucasus
6355277 georgia accession to nato will be long delayed the europeans will oppose it concerned for the security of their energy supplies
6355278 long as they remain confident that russian energy supplies are secured at least until their internal energy reforms allow them to feel less dependent on russian oil and gas
6355279 this process is more likely to be accelerated until the current us administration is in power he said
6355280 this is us project and at the moment nato is used as an instrument of actions of the state department
6355281 the u s sees georgia as a key member of an emerging security system that slowly brings together nato including turkey the gulf cooperation council iraq and india
6355282 if nato resists this emergent system the u s is likely to proceed anyway even under an obama administration seeing an important strategic interest in securing access to caspian oil that is not under russian control
6355283 georgia and ukraine and perhaps now also poland want it and probably so do the neo conservatives in the us who have a lot of difficulty dealing with reality but it would be insane
6355284 it is likely that if the situation does not change to a great extent us will play the planned game to the end which aims at establishment of bridgehead of the alliance in south caucasus more precisely at georgias admission to nato the russian expert vlasov said
6355285 osetia de sud si abhazia sunt parti integrante ale georgiei

6355287 in light of all the circumstances we conclude garey voluntarily waived his right to counsel by his conduct and because he was forewarned of the consequences of his choice and the dangers it posed we conclude the waiver was knowing therefore we affirm

6355289 the rate of diabetes in african americans is among the highest in the country
6355290 diabetes is a leading cause of heart disease blindness and kidney disease accounting for more than 18 percent of all u s medical costs
6355291 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
6355292 we are trying to do this without compromising the quality of education we owe to our students
6355293 our electricity is not fixed for four our water is not fixed for four
6355294 its a very nice political concept but its not an economically viable concept
6355295 i dont think its right for the board of regents to go back on its word
6355296 if you tell people one thing you should stick to it regardless of the circumstance
6355297 these cuts on top of that is what makes it more difficult
6355298 those three guys give us a lot of experience and theyre making plays
6355299 durham and kenny harris have not missed a practice massaquoi has been coming along and i feel comfortable with those guys
6355300 but theres a lot of potential there and its potential that weve seen flashes of a guy that can be pretty good
6355301 but when he comes back is going to be the true test of where he is
6355302 to be a member of the eagle football program student athletes have specific rules to abide by
6355303 when the institutions rules are not followed then i will take immediate and appropriate action i am disappointed to announce the suspensions concerning the respective student athletes but i expect all to learn from not doing right and make positive contributions to our program this season
6355304 fowler is no 1 on the depth chart but its not a done deal
6355305 frix hes snapping extremely well and if he can get better at blocking and covering hes going to make this a competition
6355306 he did well at right tackle then when we threw him in there at guard he actually did better at guard
6355307 hes a big bodied guy who seems to bend just right and when people run into him they dont tend to get very far
6355308 last year i struggled because i didnt respond real well to the technique part
6355309 i know how to fire off the ball and hit someone but this year ive improved on my technique a whole lot and ive got to give him all the credit in the world for that
6355310 hes not like a lot of us fat guys here hes very quick i think thats the big key is him being able to get in front of people
6355311 more than likely hell be at right tackle but i dont know that yet
6355312 i want to see how josh davis plays i want to see how cordy plays boling could be at either one and we want to see how kiante plays too because kiante might be more comfortable at right because hes got a lot more practice there and boling might move over to left tackle
6355313 hes known for vince go in at guard cordy go in at tackle
6355314 its never really been you play guard even chris davis he plays center but theyll stick him in at guard sometimes so its never set in stone where youre at
6355315 is going to have to prove they deserve to play
6355316 youve got to master the playbook youve got to know yourself and theres a time for everything
6355317 him being here has been a great blessing because hes excellent at what he does
6355318 hes got excellent fundamentals excellent knowledge of the scheme hes just a person that you can sit back and observe how he does things hes a good example and a great leader
6355319 hes always been eager to strike someone hes very physical but hes getting more comfortable
6355320 my daughter has taught me more than i could ever imagine including that you need to take the time to stop and smell the roses or watch the ants as they take food to there home

6355516 instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralised facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6355517 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive
6355518 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 4 800 an ounce
6355519 and if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6355520 as gasoline prices continue to rise hydrogen produced from renewable sources such as bio liquids will be more and more competitive also the possibility of using hydrogen in fuel cells will provide much higher efficiency than internal combustion engines can so the actual cost in dollars per mile may already be lower
6355521 rather than being a clean alternative to fossil fuels biofuels are actually increasing carbon dioxide emissions hydrogen fuelled cars are still a long way off the immediate priority for cutting emissions is smarter cars that burn less fuel

6355555 its destroying our family for what amounts to a high school prank
6355556 yes he deserves punishment but he didnt do anything wrong that would make him deserve being on the sex offender registry
6355557 he knew what he was doing was mean but he had no clue of the legal ramifications

6355559 were talking about making sure the law works for real families and real situations

6355565 kids may think theyre in love with someone and engage in that kind of conduct but more often than not these romances wear off and youve left someone sexually explicit pictures of you they can be posted on web pages out of revenge for breaking up or out of some sort of sick sense of humor it can come back in a 100 different ways to hurt you

6355571 there are a lot of new places you have to figure out where they are i didnt know where to go for my first class because its a different building from the old one ill be doing a lot of wondering around today
6355572 for the first one to two days it will be like this but theyre excited and theyre looking good and they are doing what theyre supposed to
6355573 the longer it goes the more you wonder whether he just walked out the other side of the park
6355574 typically when people kill themselves they dont go out of their way to make themselves hard to find
6355575 we have completely turned this part of town around and we dont want to see a homeless shelter in the middle of town
6355576 i really dont understand why it cant stay where it is
6355577 by saying were going to move it into your neighborhood youre basically saying you value them more than us
6355578 we either put 150 or so homeless men on the street or we put them somewhere else
6355579 but of all the solutions that are out there this probably makes the most sense
6355580 but if they find another location ill take a look at it
6355581 the opportunity to participate in act so has been more than just competition it has been life altering
6355582 going to the national competition was like being let in on a truth that the rest of america had yet to catch on to the talented black youth in america are exceptional

6355584 its just a matter of using the one cent sales tax which is going to be there either way

6355594 a fire tends to burn more rapidly people have less time than they realize to get out
6355595 because of the roughly two years this process has taken the district cannot provide good title for the property so rice development partners decided not to proceed with the contract
6355596 with the best interest of moving to a positive result for the rice site and recognizing that due to delays and the uncertain time frame of the lawsuit rice development partners would withdraw which effectively removes the basis of the lawsuit challenging the proposed sale to rice development partners we trust that the process will continue in a direction that is best for the neighborhood in that community spirit tom boesen and frank boesen initiated contact with the des moines school board to explore other options that would benefit the community
6355597 what can you do about the ragweed count in iowa my allergies are killing me

6355602 what we had before was water rushing down the grades on 28th street out onto forest avenue and into the storm sewers
6355603 this permeable paving will slow the water down and allow it to seep into the ground
6355604 before this project what you had was basically a city street in the middle of campus except with gates at both ends
6355605 this will make the area look a little bit more like its a part of drakes campus
6355606 ill bet you thought when you left middle school in eighth grade that youd never be back here
6355607 i walked down that hall and all i saw were middle schoolers
6355608 were going to have to make the best of it we have no choice
6355609 the first football practice you look up and the high schools gone
6355610 i was here 30 years so you kind of get attached to things
6355611 how many of you are glad you didnt have to take your semester test in spanish

6355620 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6355621 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6355622 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6355623 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time
6355624 that was definitely a break to move that inning along
6355625 youre going to lose some tough ones but what really matters is what you do after that

6355656 trees in poems are beautiful objects but they are also things that tap on your window at night and in many fairy stories are quite evil and dangerous
6355657 but these trees are like people its nice being up here with them and they change your view and perception of the world
6355658 the other day when i arrived i was walking on the sidewalk and the tree was following me as i was walking along it was quite strange
6355659 if you stand and look at the tree and the world starts spinning around you it can be very disturbing

6355673 one the school where fr pandipally was working is doing very well and it also has a dispute with another school
6355674 second fr pandipally had expelled the driver of a school bus over some dispute on his salary
6355675 the crowd also indulged in vandalism and demolished a statue of mother mary
6355676 the police had to lock up the building and take the keys with them to pacify the crowd
6355677 later the fcc sisters filed a suit in the court of law against the protestors
6355678 and the sisters started receiving threats on phone that if they did not withdraw the case some members of their communities would be attacked
6355679 a huge crowd led by rss supporters gathered around the school and tried to parade the then principal naked under flimsy pretexts but the police protected him

6355682 all over his face on his eyes lips and cheeks deep wounds were found his motorcycle was thrown in bushes about four kilometers away he was done to death in the forest and his body was brought back and thrown in the middle of the road
6355683 the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing which is the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in the country
6355684 i am not against christianity but raju and daniel converted hundreds of hindu families

6355697 um unser it system auf den neuesten stand zu bringen suchten wir nach einer flexiblen und effizienten l sung mit dieser l sung wollten wir den pr fprozess f r unsere rechnungen verbessern und schneller auf ver nderte gesch ftsanforderungen reagieren k nnen
6355698 trotz der gefahr im verzug hat die bundesregierung bis heute keine politischen aktivit ten gesetzt wie in partei bergreifenden resolutionen in sechs landtagen gefordert durch die neuwahlen und anschlie ende regierungsbildung drohen weitere inakzeptable zeitverluste
6355699 wir m chten die bundesregierung daher an ihre verantwortung gegen ber den menschen dieses landes und an ihre pflichten erinnern damit die l ngst berf lligen schritte unverz glich noch vor der nationalratswahl gesetzt werden
6355700 die bundesregierung muss prim r eine klare ablehnung dieser inakzeptablen und unn tigen bedrohung bei den regierungen der slowakei und italiens deponieren und sie ersuchen von der realisierung des projektes mochovce 3 und 4 abstand zu nehmen
6355701 diese schritte k nnen das wegen ungesicherter finanzierung und bedenken der eu kommission schwer angeschlagene projekt bereits endg ltig zum fall bringen
6355702 die eu kommission u erte schwere bedenken zur sicherheit des mochovce projektes und fordert den nachweis einer mit dem containment moderner druckwasserreaktoren vergleichbaren schutzniveaus
6355703 es ist jedoch klar dass die mochovce reaktoren diese bedingung niemals erf llen k nnen genau an diesem punkt m ssen die sterreichischen aktivit ten ansetzen
6355704 die bundesregierung muss die regierungen der slowakei und italiens unverz glich zu internationalen konsultationen zur sicherheit des akw mochovce auffordern
6355705 der von der eu kommission verlangte sicherheitsnachweis f r die schutzh lle muss auf dringend expertenebene behandelt werden
6355706 zuerst als regierungspartei feuer und flamme f r die drastischen sparma nahmen bei der polizei zu sein und dann wenn die folgen dieser ma nahme dramatisch sind beklagen dass es zuwenig polizistinnen in wien gibt eine solche h chst widerspr chliche politik ist das markenkennzeichen der sicherheitspolitik der wiener fp
6355707 wo war denn die wiener fp als ihre f r das bundespersonal zust ndige freiheitliche vizekanzlerin gleich zu beginn ihrer amtszeit mit dem rotstift durch den dienstellenplan auch bei der polizei gefahren ist wo waren die proteste dagegen seitens dieser partei im wiener gemeinderat wo waren die wiener fp politikerinnen als die wiener sp von allem anfang an gegen die sparma nahmen und die zerschlagung des bew hrten polizeispitzenteams heftig protestierte nirgends
6355708 die damals schwere fehleinsch tzung durch die fp ihre mitverantwortung f r die unangenehmen folgen k nnen nun nicht ganz einfach durch die forderung von frau matiasek nach einrichtung eines eigenen st dtischen wachk rpers gleichsam aus der welt geschaffen werden
6355709 das total gescheiterte experiment der fp in graz mit der von ihr aufgestellten und intensiv unterst tzten stadtwache eine art b rgerwehr zur unterst tzung der polizei dort ist diese ma nahme wegen chronischer erfolglosigkeit still und leise entsorgt worden was einmal mehr die inkompetenz der fp in der realen sicherheitspolitik unterstreicht wo die fp beweisen h tte k nnen dass sie es besser macht hat sie nachweislich schwer versagt

6355714 j hrlich werden millionenbetr ge in den ausbau und die verbesserung des ffentlichen ver kehrs investiert dennoch k nnen viele salzburgerinnen und salzburger auf ihrem weg zur arbeit auf das eigene auto nicht verzichten oft fahren viele menschen morgens t glich zur gleichen zeit in die gleiche richtung und abends wieder retour mit einer neuen internet plattform sollen fahrgemeinschaften einfach und praktisch organisiert werden k nnen das macht sich bezahlt f r die autofahrer und f r die umwelt
6355715 nicht alle ziele k nnen mit dem ffentlichen ver kehr problemlos erreicht werden in manchen regionen ist es schwierig auch nur ein basis angebot zu finanzieren da geht es meistens nicht mehr ohne den pkw und auf den hauptverkehrsachsen in den sto zeiten geht es wiederum nicht mehr mit dem pkw zumindest nicht schnell
6355716 das problem dabei ist nicht das fahrzeug an sich sondern dessen insasse der sich in nur etwa einem von zehn f llen in gesellschaft befindet dieser niedrige besetzungsgrad verursacht t glich staus emissionen und kosten und lenkt die k nftige aufteilung der finanzen f r verkehrswege in falsche bahnen diese situation ist paradox und ineffizient

6355719 against all odds a tibetan has once again raised our outlawed national flag in beijing tonight
6355720 this action symbolises the determination and steadfast commitment of the tibetan people and our supporters from around the world to achieve freedom and justice for six million tibetans living under the brutal rule of the chinese government
6355721 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6355722 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people
6355723 the future of aviation isnt just about airlines its about individuals

6355733 theyve stolen everything theyve bombed everything this is fascism thats what this is
6355734 any time you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6355735 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation any time that happens its great
6355736 thats huge any time you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6355737 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6355738 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6355739 he always had good stuff he throws a heavy ball

6355745 es sind zwar nicht alle frauen in die drei screening zentren gegangen die einladekampagne hat aber nachweislich zum problembewusstsein der zielgruppe beigetragen

6355752 the crowd was trying to hold back the groom from mouthing off more but finally he broke free and they had to take him down
6355753 he was heading for the officers then the bride moved in and tried to interfere

6355756 das war ja ein relativ kurzes gastspiel in peking wie waren denn die eindr cke
6355757 unabh ngig vom ergebnis das berhaupt nicht toll war war ich schon sehr beeindruckt davon was dort abging wir waren im olympischen dorf untergebracht wo ich jeden tag so viele top sportler gesehen habe das war schon eine tolle atmosph re au erdem nach china kommt man auch nicht jeden tag wenn man mal bei olympia war dann bekommt man eine idee davon welch ein gewaltiger organisationsaufwand hinter all dem steckt
6355758 zu ihrer olympia nominierung sind sie letztlich doch ein wenig gekommen wie die jungfrau zum kinde wie war ihre erste reaktion
6355759 nun ja die vorbereitung auf olympia war gelaufen und eigentlich war klar dass ich nicht mitfahre ich war schon voll in der saisonvorbereitung mit der hsg wetzlar und hatte zuf llig einen freien tag als ich davon erfuhr dass lars kaufmann sich verletzte und ich als p athlet also als m glicher ersatz mit nach peking reisen sollte das kam schon v llig berraschend innerhalb k rzester zeit hatte ich unglaublich viele dinge zu organisieren ich brauchte vor allem ein visum stand im st ndigen dialog mit der mannschaft und dem deutschen handballbund und hatte keine zeit ber all das nachzudenken erst im flieger habe ich realisiert mann ich fliege jetzt nach peking
6355760 und dann werfen sie gegen d nemark ihr erstes olympiator
6355761 ich hatte insgesamt wenig einsatzzeiten aber das war ja klar nachdem aus der p nominierung eine a nominierung wurde und ich f r pascal hens in die mannschaft r ckte es ging in erster linie darum f r ein klein wenig entlastung zu sorgen nerv s war ich weniger denn wenn ich reinkomme dann mache ich einfach mein spiel ob das dann optimal l uft m ssen andere entscheiden
6355762 da gab es keine probleme ich habe ja bereits einen gro teil der vorbereitung mitgemacht zudem ist das eine richtig homogene truppe
6355763 und die familie im heimischen l beck die hat doch sicher komplett mitgefiebert
6355764 in l beck waren sie alle aufgeregt ich bin mir sicher die sind auch nachts aufgestanden um sich die spiele anzuschauen die wussten dass olympia mein gro es ziel war und das was ich hier erlebt habe macht definitiv lust auf mehr
6355765 haben sie bei alldem noch eindr cke von der stadt peking sammeln k nnen
6355766 leider ganz wenig ich glaube die olympischen spiele zeigen nicht das wahre peking man merkt das bereits je weiter man sich vom olympiagel nde fortbewegt
6355767 ich kann noch gar nicht in worte fassen was da in peking passiert ist innerhalb von drei spielen war alles verloren den entscheidenden punkt haben wir wohl im spiel gegen die russen liegen gelassen das ist echt hart aber dennoch gilt wir k nnen es jetzt nur besser machen
6355768 den haben mir schon zu lemgoer zeiten die beiden ramota br der verpasst das war in meiner anfangszeit so in den ersten ein oder zwei wochen mein kompletter name klingt ja sehr nordisch und insgesamt war der denen wohl einfach zu lang und irgendwie sind die beiden dann auf sm re
6355769 es hei t daniel stephan sei in lemgo ihr f rderer gewesen stimmt das
6355770 es gab und es gibt noch immer viele leute von denen ich mir dinge abschaue volker mudrow zum beispiel mein erster trainer in der liga hat mir die feinheiten des bundesligaalltags beigebracht das ist ohnehin ein st ndiger lernprozess ich bin ja schlie lich noch lange kein fertiger spieler ich versuche immer mir die positiven eigenschaften meiner mitspieler selbst drauf zu schaffen dazu hat sicher auch daniel stephan viel beigetragen wir sind befreundet und telefonieren h ufig miteinander
6355771 nun in der anfang september beginnenden saison spielen sie f r ihren neuen verein hsg wetzlar mit welchen erwartungen gehen sie in die spielzeit
6355772 wir wollen mit unserer jungen wilden truppe zeigen dass wir
6355773 its going to take a while for it to sink in
6355774 i gave it everything and now i have something to show for it its a once in a lifetime experience
6355775 i knew maarten finished well so i was trying to stay with him
6355776 i had to battle with the group with 700 metres to go and i lost a lot of strength in the fight to stay in the race
6355777 that cost me silver but i am happy with bronze
6355778 its the first time that i have got two cards in my career

6355854 esta manifestaci n en el pleno est haciendo eco de la acci n de las mujeres organizadas en honduras en contra de daniel ortega nos hemos sumado a la iniciativa que se tuvo en paraguay y podemos decir que esto ha tenido un impacto a nivel continental
6355855 esta vez las mujeres organizadas est n preparando algunas protestas y en el congreso hoy ayer se sumaron hombres y mujeres de los partidos pol ticos esto es un llamado de rechazo a su presencia en honduras por las mismas razones que se hicieron en paraguay
6355856 sobre todo en el caso de zoilam rica que era una ni a y que no tuvo ninguna posibilidad de hacer su denuncia
6355857 yo tambi n firm la manifestaci n y creo que con la reacci n de hoy el congreso seguir apoyando a las organizaciones de mujeres es una forma de solidaridad con la denuncia internacional de zoilam rica
6355858 ortega es un persona que ha sido se alada de pedofilia de abuso de menores con el agravante de incesto
6355859 entonces son situaciones sumamente delicadas que llaman a la reflexi n sobre todo para los j venes porque no podemos tener como paradigmas como modelos del xito pol tico a personajes que representan antivalores
6355860 ortega ha estado denunciado por su hijastra por el acto de ultraje
6355861 ellos nunca se han interesado sobre el tema de la violencia ni les interes el caso de zoilam rica
6355862 si hubieran gozado con el respaldo de por los menos 50 diputados el manifiesto se habr a firmado pero es que adem s ser a inconstitucional que el congreso presione al presidente zelaya por la independencia de los poderes ya que es el ejecutivo el que define su pol tica exterior

6355880 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
6355881 our members job is to produce skilled resources for the country but after 14 years of independence 90 of teachers are still computer illiterate that s a difficult task confronting us if you are going to revolutionise education you should make ict an important part of everyday activities
6355882 the demand for resources is growing and therefore we need to explore every avenue to create advantages for our citizens
6355883 the state should be leading us not spending money on arms deals
6355884 when will this happen the state rolling out laptops to teachers can they tell us when when are they implementing it
6355885 we have to revolutionise teaching and it will make it easier
6355886 the idea is to permeate our institutions with ict so it can become a live experience instead of a pipedream it is a pipedream as we speak
6355887 we have had complaints about connectivity in the netherlands but have not had more complaints than usual for a 3g phone in germany our technicians said today apple has issued a software update but it is too early to tell if the problems are solved

6355893 dont ask dont tell unambiguously maintains that open homosexuality within the military services presents an intolerable risk to morale cohesion and discipline
6355894 i do believe the dont ask dont tell policy has been very effective weve got the best military weve ever had i think its logical to leave this issue alone
6355895 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
6355896 im a christian and so although i try not to have my religious beliefs dominate or determine my political views on this issue i do believe that tradition and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman
6355897 the family represents the foundation of western civilization and civil society and john mccain believes the institution of marriage is a union between one man and one woman it is only this definition that sufficiently recognizes the vital and unique role played by mothers and fathers in the raising of children and the role of the family in shaping stabilizing and strengthening communities and our nation

6355981 a simple common sense test in choosing a winner is to ask whether a daycare center or an elementary school could be named after each winner
6355982 imagine the henry morgentaler daycare centre or the henry morgentaler elementary school somehow this does not match with the historic honour of the award
6355983 so let us go forward and work toward building a welcoming home for the unborn and thus a better country she said adding
6355984 drogba will not be back before a month a month and a half
6355985 we would love to go back to england with duke of marmalade although he did travel over and back on tuesday and that is the plan once we are 100 per cent happy with him on thursday
6355986 he seems to be fine though obviously we havent done much with him this week
6355987 red rock canyon will join him in the international though we wont be having any other runners in the rescheduled york races
6355988 it is certainly an option but ill be discussing the situation with john ferguson chief bloodstock agent to sheikh mohammed wife of new approachs owner princess haya in the morning
6355989 we are very optimistic about the future of the racecourse as a racecourse
6355990 we will go to an bord pleann la planning board if we have to but were 90 per cent there its a fantastic decision for the people of tralee and of kerry
6355991 we want the race company to re register with horse racing ireland as soon as possible and to fulfil its duties as a race company if they go about things in the right way they will get fixtures no one in killarney is going to resent tralee in such circumstances
6355992 im not angling for a move but if the opportunity arose before the transfer deadline and if something were to happen and fulham give me the green light then who knows
6355993 last season wasnt good enough for myself anybody that doesnt play week in week out is obviously going to be disappointed
6355994 but its something as a footballer as a striker you become used to strikers are probably rotated more than anybody
6355995 i think that the players championship and the fedex cup have enough credibility to offset a season if you were to do well in those events and not win a major
6355996 but still the majors have had that sense of history that is hard to replace in just two years
6355997 but still i think anybody that does well and plays well in the fedex cup and wins the fedex cup i think that would ease anything if they didnt play well in the majors
6355998 i think there is a close call because you are talking about two top class international goalkeepers ive said from day one that were fortunate to have that because they are both outstanding
6355999 craig gordon has been terrific for scotland so we are in a healthy position and we have david marshall as back up so we are fortunate to have three exceptional goalkeepers
6356000 its healthy competition at the moment craigs my number one but allans come in and done exceptionally well
6356001 i think at this precise moment craig gordon hasnt put a step wrong and he knows that allans got 45 minutes under his belt and shown what a top international keeper he is as well
6356002 i think it was a good workout and i was able to blood a number of new players young darren barr and christophe berra who is 23 kris commons we brought in as well and michael stewart as well and they all did well so that was great
6356003 overall we passed the ball quite well at times and we knew they would make it difficult for us and they are a strong international side and these games are always difficult
6356004 we tried james mcfadden and kenny miller upfront and we were maybe just lacking that bit of cutting edge when you are at home and you are looking to put teams under pressure youre looking to put the ball into the net but we were unlucky a couple of times not to score
6356005 i think at home we had to look at it the system to play a positive side to win the game we didnt win it but it wasnt for lack of trying to attack teams
6356006 it was full of dreams and heart warming i think many people are seeking something like this
6356007 miyazaki sticks to creating animated films by hand drawing in that sense his works are old type animation
6356008 family dynasties like this in illinois are remarkably common in american politics president bush is the son of a president and grandson of a senator benjamin harrison was william henry harrisons grandson and john quincy adams was john adamss son sen evan bayh a leading vice presidential candidate is the son of a man who held the same senate seat al gore is the son of a senator fdr barry goldwater and ted kennedy all had sons who served in congress
6356009 on the day of judgment we shall set up scales of justice so that no one will be dealt with unjustly in any way even if someone has an act as small as a grain of a mustard seed we will bring it to account and sufficient are we to settle the accounts

6356016 one the school where fr pandipally was working is doing very well and it also has a dispute with another school
6356017 second fr pandipally had expelled the driver of a school bus over some dispute on his salary
6356018 the crowd also indulged in vandalism and demolished a statue of mother mary
6356019 the police had to lock up the building and take the keys with them to pacify the crowd
6356020 later the fcc sisters filed a suit in the court of law against the protestors
6356021 and the sisters started receiving threats on phone that if they did not withdraw the case some members of their communities would be attacked
6356022 a huge crowd led by rss supporters gathered around the school and tried to parade the then principal naked under flimsy pretexts but the police protected him
6356023 why should anyone kill him so brutally i cant understand
6356024 his head was hit with sticks and boulders and the skull was split open
6356025 all over his face on his eyes lips and cheeks deep wounds were found his motorcycle was thrown in bushes about four kilometers away he was done to death in the forest and his body was brought back and thrown in the middle of the road
6356026 the indian church is shocked and deeply saddened by this barbarous killing which is the result of a growing climate of intolerance and violence against christians in the country
6356027 i am not against christianity but raju and daniel converted hundreds of hindu families
6356028 they enticed them with money we have done this to prevent further conversions this act should be a lesson for others

6356059 trees in poems are beautiful objects but they are also things that tap on your window at night and in many fairy stories are quite evil and dangerous
6356060 but these trees are like people its nice being up here with them and they change your view and perception of the world
6356061 the other day when i arrived i was walking on the sidewalk and the tree was following me as i was walking along it was quite strange
6356062 if you stand and look at the tree and the world starts spinning around you it can be very disturbing

6356073 we feel that our value proposition developed in the mature uk and european market can add value in the emerging middle east market and provide a strong offer
6356074 i think there is a close call because you are talking about two top class international goalkeepers ive said from day one that were fortunate to have that because they are both outstanding
6356075 craig gordon has been terrific for scotland so we are in a healthy position and we have david marshall as back up so we are fortunate to have three exceptional goalkeepers
6356076 its healthy competition at the moment craigs my number one but allans come in and done exceptionally well
6356077 i think at this precise moment craig gordon hasnt put a step wrong and he knows that allans got 45 minutes under his belt and shown what a top international keeper he is as well
6356078 i think it was a good workout and i was able to blood a number of new players young darren barr and christophe berra who is 23 kris commons we brought in as well and michael stewart as well and they all did well so that was great
6356079 overall we passed the ball quite well at times and we knew they would make it difficult for us and they are a strong international side and these games are always difficult
6356080 we tried james mcfadden and kenny miller upfront and we were maybe just lacking that bit of cutting edge when you are at home and you are looking to put teams under pressure youre looking to put the ball into the net but we were unlucky a couple of times not to score
6356081 i think at home we had to look at it the system to play a positive side to win the game we didnt win it but it wasnt for lack of trying to attack teams

6356083 matt showed maturity beyond his years in his play today
6356084 both of them led us to victory with exceptional play today
6356085 they had very solid play on a very diffcult golf course it was windy today and those scores in my opinion were pretty phenominal for high schools golfers
6356086 i got to know four of them early on tim burke brandon blankenship andrew hockett and jason myers have been my go to guys since i got here
6356087 they have started early stayed late never complained what a first class staff they have been you can add derek bennett to that group
6356088 yeah it head coach is a lot different than being a player or an assistant
6356089 i know bobby tazewell head coach bobby wyatt will appreciate this with all the little nuances i have really started to see in a different light since i have been put in charge of a program
6356090 mike is a fine person i think he will work very hard on and off the field
6356091 he deserves to have a good year and we are all cheering for him
6356092 youre working the weight room for instance it takes time and effort for the players and i try to monitor progress make suggestions for improvement
6356093 youre kind of a recruiter checking the school to see if you might find students who are not on the team who might come out and become productive players
6356094 the nfl is one thing but right now i mow grass help line the field change light bulbs clean the dressing room and work on fixing water wheels
6356095 i think the actual job description what a high school head football coach at any school really does is probably a lot different its fun though i love it and this is what i want to do
6356096 overtime will air each friday night from 10 to 11 and provides scores and interviews from that nights games
6356097 randy and i dont have much in common but theres been a relationship between hendrick motorsports and this race team through the years weve gotten more media out of it
6356098 driving in the truck race cant hurt were here because we wanted to get the rhythm of the track sooner
6356099 its a taxing track both mentally and physically but when youre right its one of the best tracks to race at and you have more fun than anywhere else
6356100 ive been here before with the exact same setup as jeff gordon and hes on the pole and winning the race and im qualifying 20 something and finishing 15th certain tracks fit certain drivers crew chiefs and setups
6356101 this place has been one of the toughest for me to figure out at times i think im flying around but im in a 15th place car
6356102 on the other hand at lowes motor speedway regardless of what i do i do well there its a good track for me and i run up front
6356103 the lack of horsepower was the most surprising thing when you go back to the gas pedal theres not much there
6356104 im used to all the power that our cup cars have
6356105 id like to be in kyles position where on a bad day youre running second in the chase last year we were in or near the top 5 and it paid off
6356106 we have a lot of testing ahead of us and were on to some things were doing all that we can to get in the chase
6356107 i lost it four times but saved it only three
6356108 its not so much about how things have gone and now i can see the ball
6356109 its the way our offense is set up and designed that anybody can get the ball now its not just targeted toward one position
6356110 last year our plays were designed to go to a particular player and then when the play was broken up we could throw it out to our checkdowns
6356111 now theres the great opportunity in this offense where you can throw to anybody
6356112 i would see the same amount of snaps as darius but the majority of the balls were doing to darius or pat was throwing out in the flat to steve slaton
6356113 part of that was play calling and sometimes the play would get broken up or the defense would put them in a good situation to just take it inside to steve or pat would scramble out and run
6356114 you cant always be selfish and i knew that i had a position on this team and a role on this team that was going to help us to get to the nokia sugar bowls the fiesta bowls and the gator bowls
6356115 since ive been here we have been very consistent and people know they can never take for granted the things that i have done
6356116 its like offensive linemen that running back has 250 yards and hes a heisman candidate and not a lineman is getting the credit that day on espn news
6356117 you watch that film the next day on sunday and you see why we won that game
6356118 our receiving corps for the past three years has been phenomenal out there on the perimeter blocking and nobody can ever take that for granted
6356119 that is something that has always been preached to any other young receiver out there that youve been taught your whole life to catch the ball as a receiver but can you go out there and make a block on somebody else
6356120 can you go out there and be a team player and its not just all about you you and you
6356121 we both came in at the same time and from then to now his passing has improved dramatically
6356122 i think this offense compliments pat very well because it gives him an opportunity to look down the field from short to long
6356123 you see something that is not there short then we go long and hes reading a lot better hes reading his reads from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 and then if those reads are not open then he decides to take off and run
6356124 you still have a lot of guys that are filling the shoes of people that are missed right now but i think in this offense it compliments the people that are here now a lot better than the previous players
6356125 its the same one every year everybody says they want a national championship and these are our goals but i always say youve got to start small one day at a time and our first goal right now is villanova
6356126 thats what is on our chest and that is our goal to beat villanova right now so we need to go out there and prepare for them because theyre a great team
6356127 we cant come out and think were going to run over anybody because villanova can come in here easily and win the ball game if we are not prepared that is what we are practicing real hard to get ready for villanova
6356128 the fans are looking ahead but theyre not out here grinding right now
6356129 they can look as far ahead as they want to but the fans are going to be there behind us no matter where were at
6356130 it excites me a lot but what i think will excite me even more is when i am in the game and ive caught the ball and im on the sidelines saying wow he lived up to his word
6356131 then i can say this has truly been a blessing and opportunity to play for coach stewart
6356132 todays linux unix bash shell script is is a blatant exploitation of a post we did not too long ago where we put together a thesaurus shell script
6356133 in our post were going to look at one condition under which unix and linux operating systems can actually hold onto shell script to emulate a thesaurus for linux or unix
6356134 todays linux unix bash shell script is for those of us who sometimes get lost for words this happens to me at least how to manage your disk by uuid on linux
6356135 uuid notation when used as a means to access disk is just one more way that linux has moved ahead of the pack to finding running process ids on linux using pidof
6356136 more hardware manufacturers than ever support linux in some way they supply binary drivers or support and sponsor foss drivers
6356137 we need a new organization to vet licenses going forward a lot more carefully one made up of experienced foss lawyers none of them two malaysian states move to openoffice org
6356138 what is interesting is that the public sector in malaysia is moving towards foss independently from any government directive or a big day in court for the foss community
6356139 if a licensee does something under the particular license in question that it wasnt supposed to do then that doesnt mom nature wins again
6356140 as powerful as all this cool technology is its also fragile as i learned yet again today
6356141 i stephanie tubbs jones a representative from ohio and ms boxer a senator from california
6356142 i thank god that i have a senator joining me in this objection
6356143 while some have called our cause foolish i can assure you that my parents mary and andrew tubbs did not raise any fools and as a lawyer former judge and prosecutor i am duty bound to follow the law and apply the law to the facts as i find them
6356144 it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today
6356145 this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning or challenging the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy
6356146 i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow republican members of congress
6356147 i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people
6356148 again i thank senator boxer for joining me in this objection to the counting of ohios electoral votes due to the considerable number of voting irregularities that transpired in my home state
6356149 there are serious allegations in two lawsuits pending in ohio that debate the constitutionality of the denial of provisional ballots to voters
6356150 moreover as you are aware advancing legislative initiatives is more challenging when you are in the minority party in congress however this challenge is multiplied when you are in the minority in the house of representatives because of house rules compared to senate rules
6356151 voting irregularities were an issue after the 2000 presidential election when democratic house initiatives relating to election reform were not considered
6356152 therefore in order to prevent our voices from being kept silent it is imperative that we object to the counting of ohios electoral votes and debate the issue of ohios voting improprieties
6356153 there are just over 1 million registered voters in cuyahoga county which of course includes the greater cleveland area and the 11th congressional district which i represent registration increased approximately 10 percent
6356154 the beauty of the 2004 election was that more people were fully prepared to exercise their right to vote however on election day hundreds and even thousands of individuals went to the voting polls and were denied the opportunity to have their vote count
6356155 in my own county where citizen volunteers put forth a herculean effort to register educate mobilize and protect the vote there were people who experienced irregularities
6356156 poor and minority communities had disproportionately long waits 4 to 5 hour waits were widespread election protection coalition testified that more than half of the complaints about long lines they received
6356157 cuyahoga county had an overall provisional ballot rejection rate of 32 percent
6356158 thousands of partisan challengers concentrated in cuyahoga countys minority and democratic communities effectively served to intimidate voters and confuse poll workers
6356159 there were problems with absentee ballots including incorrect information provided to voters by the secretary of state and consequently the cuyahoga county board of elections telling voters they could not vote in their precinct effectively disenfranchising hundreds and more likely thousands of voters
6356160 this objection points out the inadequacy of a great election system which permits 50 secretarys of state to administer a federal election and impose so many different state laws regulating the election
6356161 in ohio the secretary of state kenneth blackwell who served as co chair of the bush re election campaign issued a bizarre series of directives in the days preceding the 2004 presidential election that created tremendous confusion among voters in cuyahoga county and across the state of ohio
6356162 for example on september 7 2004 secretary blackwell issued a directive to local boards of elections mandating rejection of voter registration forms based on their paperweight 80lb text weight
6356163 my objection points to the need to implement across this nation standards that apply to all states
6356164 what happened in ohio may well have been repeated in counties across this country
6356165 if in fact we see it is our obligation to secure democracy around the world to monitor and oversee free and fair elections in other countries surely we must ensure protect and guarantee the right to vote right here at home
6356166 youve got to take care of the ball a little more
6356167 asked me to let you know that he will not be returning to philadelphia when his term as governor is over
6356168 it seems with city council banning trans fat in philadelphia the governor feels there really is no reason for him
6356169 the thing is when youre normal for 17 years and suddenly you lose a limb youre not disabled mentally
6356170 youre still the same person so you want to do the same things youve done before
6356171 its to come from an accident and say i can still do it if i work hard i think thats the most important thing to believe in yourself to set goals and to never give up
6356172 i had a couple of people who have said to me that it would never be possible
6356173 it was actually right after i had been in the hospital and had my amputation but a dream is about what you set for yourself and not what other people set for you
6356174 it is exceedingly hard to understand just looking at her inspires you
6356175 i would go so far as to say she should be awarded a separate medal
6356176 shes an inspiration to everyone it just shows you can do what you want if you put your mind to it
6356177 you lose one player its like losing two or three
6356178 most of your best players play both offense and defense and when you lose a player at one position you shift another over to his spot then you shift another and another
6356179 weve been down to second string quarterbacks and third string receivers
6356180 we just dont have a lot of depth health is definitely a key for us
6356181 when youre a small school you just cant afford any injuries
6356182 hes got a demeanor and a quality about him that kids i dont know of any kids that dont like him even in the school hes a leader in school
6356183 im been looking forward to it for a pretty long time
6356184 looking forward to actually getting out here and playing against some other people some other challenges and some other competition that we dont have
6356185 hes low key until you get him in the competition realm
6356186 when you put him in a competition he turns it up
6356187 im looking forward to how much weve put into practice and see what weve got to work on for the next competition and to work on it and get better
6356188 we run a little bit of a spread and a shotgun and then under center with two double wings
6356189 its confusing sometimes youve got to make sure everybodys doing what theyre supposed to do
6356190 i feel like ive got a lot of learning left to do
6356191 ive still got two more years after this year to do and i feel like ive got to learn a lot more to be a better quarterback
6356192 i think the pass patterns i need to get those under my belt first and then most of the plays theyre coming to me theyre getting easier as days go by
6356193 we actually had a pretty good competition with quarterbacks and his ball handling skills and his intelligence and work ethic is really what placed him above our second choice
6356194 weve got a neighbor up the road and hes got a pond up there
6356195 it depends on what day it is and how the weather is what type of bait you use
6356196 some theyre pretty hard and other times its just right i usually use spinner bait or worm
6356197 deer hunting just takes my mind off of everything else and relying on that one shot and not think about anything else
6356198 just sitting in the tree stand just up there by yourself gives you some time to think
6356199 weve got about 30 acres up at my house i use my dads 222 rifle its a one shot from 40 45 yards probably
6356200 you cant just go out the first time and expect to kill a big buck youve got to work in the offseason too if youre going to bring in a big buck youve got to work in the offseason if youre going to win a few games in football youve got to work hard
6356201 and a lot of people look at you and are like you play for pikeview you all arent any good but i think if we come out and just ignore it and play our type of football then we can win a few games
6356202 id hate to be the other team because itd be like we won the super bowl or something
6356203 itd be pretty important because if you get one under then you can build on it and i think it would be pretty important to get the first under your belt
6356204 the first thing is i hope we can win a few games and i hope we have the right attitude and mindset to win a few games this year because pikeview has been known to not win a lot of games for a while
6356205 so i hope to come out this year with the mindset to strive to win a few games and to get better
6356206 i hope that the first year well win a few games at least
6356207 the next year i hope well win even more and hopefully by my senior year i want to win state so thats my goal
6356208 hes not just looking at this year hes looking down the road and i hope hes right
6356209 isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is going for it thats our approach its pedal to the metal
6356210 the children delivered via gestational surrogacy are healthy and already under rickys full time care
6356211 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight in order to spend time with his children
6356212 ive started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50
6356213 sharons really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
6356214 kendra wilkinson has been offered her own reality show about starting her life over again when she moves out of the playboy mansion
6356215 if you go along there and look carefully at those trees how many have the bark shredded off of them
6356216 its also not a high curb raising the curb profile along the entire thing would obviously be a significant undertaking in terms of capital expenditures
6356217 people have to realize that they are recreating within a few feet of one of the busiest arteries in this town
6356218 it doesnt have enough opportunities for traffic to be calmed by traffic lights or anything else people go too fast
6356219 makes her living selling the most dangerous legal drug on the planet
6356220 she just helped stephen open the loudest restaurant in philadelphia in someone elses neighborhood
6356221 its a big middle finger f you to the city
6356222 white said reached yesterday old declined to discuss her protest
6356223 i love it this is the ultimate vindication to me
6356224 i hate the record business and i dont have much fondess for those people to see them fall on their face it makes me jump for joy
6356225 this is a sad day for coach andy he knows better hes the coach of a team that is in a quick statement contributing to the corruption of minors coach from a pastor friend show some moral courage and pull the calendar
6356226 the philadelphia italian market cookbook a taste of south ninth street
6356227 im still high as a kite floating driving down the road trying to get to pt or im still half asleep and i cant wake myself up
6356228 our job is not to help you recoup your costs
6356229 i threw in a few drop shots and a lob or two just a few irritating things
6356230 he was a jerk to me in front of my friends
6356231 i dont think pancho remembered who i was or cared
6356232 im not normally obnoxious but with him i was as obnoxious as i could be
6356233 i dont really want to talk to anyone right now
6356234 if youre looking for that wilderness get away from technology experience then yeah
6356235 i know no one wants to listen to some idiot screaming on his phone in the middle of a hike
6356236 but people should be able to call for help if needed
6356237 for most of human existence humans had to be self reliant with modern electronics its easy to always communicate how much is really needed
6356238 a civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild the spare the original is cutting itself off from its origins and betraying the principle of civilization itself
6356239 shes going to look forward to being comped in your place
6356240 the same way that movies live in hollywood and business lives on wall street and we love vegas because its the perfect place to do lounge music because there are a lot of lounges there
6356241 youve gotta have a piano player and i have the best bobby ricotta hes fantastic youve gotta have a great big band drummer like our frank feta whos phenomenal and we also have an upright bass player to round out the trio
6356242 weve put some great great standards into our act like somebody told me by the killers which is a fantastic love song and gin and juice by snoop dogg one of the greats of all music and weve got new material like this great buckcherry song crazy bitch which is a classic boy meets girl boy loses girl story
6356243 bobby go ahead and kill kenny for me would ya
6356244 its true im not a young man and my throat sometimes gives out on me
6356245 oddly enough frank sinatra had the same problem after years and years of singing you just strain it i only play once a week twice a week max but as johnny mathis once said the voice is a muscle youve got to exercise it and keep it in health
6356246 i get really tired of not being able to play in a good room not being able to get a good drink
6356247 and theres so many nights when id rather be across town seeing a show we were in town last week playing a corporate gig the new media expo and i had to miss steve lawrence because of it i was so mad
6356248 i love tom jones and i love seeing tony bennett all the time
6356249 i listen to swing and big band and lounge music and vocal standard music all the time thats whats on my ipod its mostly sinatra tony bennett sammy and dean but theres also some great vocalists from the 50s that not many people know about and its not that im studying them its love
6356250 the new orleans jazz and heritage festival will honor louis on his 100th birthday
6356251 theres a jazz park on bourbon street and they have statues of al hirt pete fountain and louis armstrong i would like to see them get a statue of louis in there
6356252 ive been trying to get some recognition in las vegas for louis but so far nothing not even a park named after him even though he helped make it the entertainment capital of the world in 1956 it amazes me
6356253 the fans know and love my father and his music its the venues
6356254 louis music is still a vital part of mainstream pop culture
6356255 they may not know louis prima but when you put his music into a contemporary context people remember
6356256 louis should receive a posthumous lifetime achievement grammy or even an academy award
6356257 hes like a brand name musically he would take anything whether his own composition or a standard and once louis prima got hold of it and put it in his own style it was unmistakable he is still unique and recognizable today
6356258 being a lifelong republican i was both dumb founded and dismayed that the republican platform includes a specific directive against internet gaming
6356259 whoever decided this was a good idea shouldve thought twice because this does nothing but take away every americans right to spend their own money in their own home as they see fit
6356260 the gop stands for freedom from government oppression stating in our platform that we are against internet gambling or any other form of government controlled gambling casinos just puts more restrictions on freedom of the people
6356261 millions of americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families we support legislation prohibiting gambling over the internet or in student athletics by student athletes who are participating in competitive sports
6356262 while i would support a nod to internet gaming in the platform i cannot imagine that such language would be added at this late date
6356263 come election time were going to have to let our people know
6356264 theyre basically taking the position that they can decide which ones they will allow and which ones they wont allow
6356265 speaking in general terms when we find out about something that shouldnt be going on we take the appropriate action
6356266 they want to get all the mileage they can out of sex but they dont want to deliver
6356267 its completely hypocritical you would think that here of all places it would be legalized and done properly
6356268 i told them what to look for the principals involved how the businesses operated
6356269 i want to create a nice clean place in a city that doesnt have anything like that right now
6356270 if the merry mikesters were birds what kind would they be
6356271 i love csn and i would like the blog to be a place where everyone can feel welcome to say what they would like to say whatever it is in a polite civil and thoughtful manner
6356272 see a conspiracy behind every appointment every hire every decision thats made
6356273 its very easy to complain or cast stones it takes a lot more work to get out and make a difference
6356274 statements and opinions would come out on her blog that would never see the light of day on the official e mail system
6356275 i value the fact that tenure protects a faculty members ability to do that
6356276 to encourage a bit less venom and a bit more lightheartedness
6356277 i dont like gossip i wish that were not part of the blog
6356278 but on the other hand do you not publish it if thats on someones mind and i dont feel i have the right to do that i just wish people would get off of that and engage in some more serious discussion
6356279 what have we done besides talk about cuts for the last year
6356280 you have to talk about them but parallel to it you have to have a program running over here with people looking saying how long can we afford to do it this way
6356281 whats going to be left for the sage commission to tell us needs to be cut
6356282 that might have been a good thing when someone decided we needed to do it
6356283 were just on one side of just cut thats not a plan were being forced to cut so thats not a plan
6356284 if you have a plan the pressure is on them
6356285 if youre a republican and you have a plan democrats have a problem if youre a democrat and have a plan republicans have a problem
6356286 the governor wants to have a steady and predictable amount of growth
6356287 we have a system now where the state has allocated all the money it thinks it has every year
6356288 if things turn around and just go back to normal we are still terribly behind
6356289 i think what reasonable people are starting to say is if this goes on for two years and then another two years when do we do something different from cutting
6356290 the reason we have a ceo of a company the president of the united states the reason we have a governor is we put them in a leadership role
6356291 some people are better at it than others but leadership is tantamount to the position
6356292 im not invited to those receptions youre not invited to those receptions
6356293 i had some disc problems and so that was kind of set me back
6356294 back to because parkinson s isn t a degenerative disease in the sense at least not young onset that say aos is or ms or other
6356295 protester contre les prix pratiqu s dans la grande distribution et faire acte de solidarit entre producteurs et consommateurs
6356296 les prix pay s aux agriculteurs sont si faibles depuis plusieurs ann es que a a fait dispara tre la moiti des producteurs et fait seffondrer les volumes de la production fran aise
6356297 les prix pay s par les consommateurs sont si lev s plus 15 20 en trois ans que a limite la consommation de fruits et l gumes et plombe le pouvoir dachat des m nages
6356298 une centaine de producteurs du modef seront pr sents sur lensemble des lieux de vente pour parler de leur situation d fendre la production fran aise de fruits et l gumes qui est en voie de disparition et demander au gouvernement de prendre ses responsabilit s face au comportement de la grande distribution
6356299 un gouvernement qui nous dit quil faut poursuivre les r formes pour r soudre la question du pouvoir dachat
6356300 toutes les r formes mises en oeuvre par fillon et sarkozy depuis des semaines des mois vont lencontre du pouvoir dachat que ce soit la r forme des retraites la r forme des 35 heures celle qui touche aux droits des ch meurs
6356301 situation extr mement difficile des agriculteurs sp cialement ceux des fruits et l gumes qui ne se voient pas assurer des prix r mun rateurs
6356302 ce gouvernement ne prend pas en compte les risques de r cession que conna t notre pays les difficult s profondes que connaissent les salari s les retrait s
6356303 il veut continuer une politique qui a montr son incapacit r soudre cette crise conomique que nous connaissons cette crise de lagriculture que nous connaissons
6356304 ive had preliminary talks and theres been interest from elsewhere
6356305 im not angling for a move but if the opportunity arose before the transfer deadline and if something were to happen and fulham give me the green light then who knows
6356306 last season wasnt good enough for myself anybody that doesnt play week in week out is obviously going to be disappointed
6356307 but its something as a footballer as a striker you become used to strikers are probably rotated more than anybody
6356308 drogba will not be back before a month a month and a half
6356309 we are very optimistic about the future of the racecourse as a racecourse
6356310 we will go to an bord pleann la planning board if we have to but were 90 per cent there its a fantastic decision for the people of tralee and of kerry
6356311 we want the race company to re register with horse racing ireland as soon as possible and to fulfil its duties as a race company if they go about things in the right way they will get fixtures no one in killarney is going to resent tralee in such circumstances
6356312 i think that the players championship and the fedex cup have enough credibility to offset a season if you were to do well in those events and not win a major
6356313 but still the majors have had that sense of history that is hard to replace in just two years
6356314 but still i think anybody that does well and plays well in the fedex cup and wins the fedex cup i think that would ease anything if they didnt play well in the majors
6356315 shawn is going to give it a go and well just see how he does
6356316 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6356317 i think its a good thing thats a positive thing
6356318 you want continuity there granted theyve played together a long time but they need to get in there and do it now and thats what they are going to do
6356319 were going to give tony an opportunity there and see how he does if we like what we see then well give him a little bit more if we dont then well move on to something else
6356320 we have enough of a gauge where we feel he can start the game there and well see how he does
6356321 we feel comfortable enough with that and well give him an opportunity to get in there and bang it a little bit and see what he can do
6356322 fascism is essentially a response to the alienation that has been a part of the spiritual landscape of the west since the enlightenment science technology and the economic realities and environmental damage of the industrial revolution isolate the individual from nature there has thus been a genuine yearning for community and for an organic unity with the natural world
6356323 if objective knowledge is alienating subjective experience is liberating and healing authentic experience comes from unleashing the emotions cultivating the subjective and irrational dimension of life
6356324 a tribal unity of blood unmodified by ideas of a common humanity religious in the intensity of their beliefs volkists had had no real equivalent in other western nations
6356325 volk is a much more comprehensive term than people for to german thinkers ever since the birth of german romanticism in the late eighteenth century volk signified the union of a group of people with a transcendental essence this essence might be called nature or cosmos or mythos but in each instance it was fused to mans innermost nature and represented the source of his creativity his depth of feeling his individuality and his unity with other members of the volk the essential element here is the linking of the human soul with its natural surroundings with the essence of nature
6356326 it was the genius of adolf hitler to wed the volkisch flight from reality to political discipline and efficient political organization
6356327 oh god yes fuck me in the ass do it

6356329 continental was in a pretty poor negotiating position to demand a big price increase said robert heberger an analyst at merck finck in munich with a
6356330 they did well to get 75 euros even though it should have been higher
6356331 the dispute regarding the public takeover offer has been settled the tyremaker said in the statement
6356332 continental will start a new chapter in its history and therefore ceo manfred wennemer has asked to be released from his duties
6356333 from the beginning we wanted a constructive agreement in the interests of both companies schaeffler chief executive juergen geissinger in a statement
6356334 we have created the basis for a combination of two german technology leaders
6356335 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties
6356336 this is a system that is defensive and is not aimed at anyone
6356337 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site that will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of a long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6356338 the presence of the patriot battery which will defend our territory and the us installation is a practical dimension of this watershed agreement
6356339 i think there is a close call because you are talking about two top class international goalkeepers ive said from day one that were fortunate to have that because they are both outstanding
6356340 craig gordon has been terrific for scotland so we are in a healthy position and we have david marshall as back up so we are fortunate to have three exceptional goalkeepers
6356341 its healthy competition at the moment craigs my number one but allans come in and done exceptionally well
6356342 i think at this precise moment craig gordon hasnt put a step wrong and he knows that allans got 45 minutes under his belt and shown what a top international keeper he is as well
6356343 i think it was a good workout and i was able to blood a number of new players young darren barr and christophe berra who is 23 kris commons we brought in as well and michael stewart as well and they all did well so that was great
6356344 overall we passed the ball quite well at times and we knew they would make it difficult for us and they are a strong international side and these games are always difficult
6356345 we tried james mcfadden and kenny miller upfront and we were maybe just lacking that bit of cutting edge when you are at home and you are looking to put teams under pressure youre looking to put the ball into the net but we were unlucky a couple of times not to score
6356346 i think at home we had to look at it the system to play a positive side to win the game we didnt win it but it wasnt for lack of trying to attack teams
6356347 the average briton is not only using the net more they are going online faster than they used to
6356348 je suis plut t quelquun de modeste mais nous faisons des progr s dans la lutte contre le dopage dans le sport a t il expliqu il y avait eu 12 contr les positifs sydney en 2000 et 26 ath nes 2004 et daucuns diront que si nous natteignons pas ce dernier chiffre cest que le facteur dissuasif fonctionne

6356354 he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record like michael jackson said hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6356355 hes a great athlete and to win eight gold medals is great im on the track and hes in the water so you cant compare
6356356 i mean come on youve seen it its ridiculous hes doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt look that easy
6356357 that would mean ill go home with the gold not the way i want to go home with it but if three people stepped out thats a gold medal for me
6356358 the most impressive athletic performance ive ever seen in my life
6356359 what it does is it freezes the bone and a little bit beyond your instruments so that you can actually get sort of a shell a kill zone
6356360 heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away
6356361 he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away
6356362 their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched
6356363 the lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance
6356364 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
6356365 but do not forget this one thing dear friends with the lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day
6356366 we can see that the magnetic fields are crucial for these complex filaments both for their survival and integrity without them these beautiful structures would be unable to withstand their surroundings and would collapse into stars
6356367 the seemingly softer tone to the committees discussion in keeping with a more muted outlook in the inflation report does seem to have pretty much ruled out any prospect of a rate hike which was already slim as it would risk an unnecessarily deep downturn
6356368 although we envisage the first rate cut next year there is every chance that the mpc begins to cut as early as november especially if commodity prices continue to fall and economic activity falters as expected
6356369 concerns about demand were a more important factor in restraining investment than restrictions in the supply of credit although credit was becoming harder to obtain
6356370 renewable energy is no longer a pipe dream it is realistic and achievable all it requires is the leadership and vision that has been lacking under years of tired labour thinking
6356371 thats why i will set out liberal democrat proposals to become energy independent by 2050 this will require the kind of ambition and political will that succeeded in putting man on the moon
6356372 i bought an electric moped which i think is the technology of the future i got rid of the leaders car shortly after i got in
6356373 something very big is going on particularly in urban britain
6356374 out of the 30 british cities we now lead 12 that has been going on for years that is where the great battlegrounds will be between ourselves and labour at the next general election there are a lot of seats up for grabs in those areas
6356375 the conservatives think they deserve the keys to no 10 without having the decency to tell the voters what they would do if they got there
6356376 they have started to talk down to britain telling voters the votes in the bag
6356377 millions of voters will start asking hard headed questions about wheres the substance wheres the beef wheres the consistency behind all the photo opportunities
6356378 on every single major issue facing us we have called it right called it earlier than the other two parties and been on the side of the british people
6356379 we want to try to get norway to put us under pressure
6356380 its just a wonderful experience to be part of it
6356381 what i think is quite clear is that we can work together in the last analysis and that what has been going on with the united states over the period of the last 3 years the divisions the violence the disenchantment with our society whether reuters south africa prices for the two major base metals have slumped as stockpiles grew after sales slowed to china a key market u k based an asset will continue to support pricing across the metals complex
6356382 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6356383 he conducted an adulterous affair before leaving his disabled wife enjoys eight residences across the country as well as corporate jets
6356384 we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment
6356385 the prices of gas are up the prices of milk are up
6356386 we certainly for a while were finding a lot more in mccains ads to complain about
6356387 if you can go quietly negative thats what hes done i think the perception is that hes still running the positive campaign
6356388 its a pretty smart high low good cop bad cop strategy
6356389 support george bush 95 per cent of the time keep spending 10bn 5 4bn a month for the war in iraq
6356390 i sometimes struggle just to get essentials you know the milk the bread
6356391 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
6356392 this is not an ordinary or everyday demonstration the indians have told us they are not afraid if the government declares a state of emergency they prefer to die there and show that this government violates human rights
6356393 and threatened to cut the supply of oil via the oil pipeline and gas through the camisea gas pipeline
6356394 train employees on the latest supply chain manager chippenham wiltshire 47 to 52 k per year
6356395 in the first half the two teams played well and the pitch was good it was possible to play football in the second half it was impossible
6356396 i am not too disappointed because the result is fair in the second half we were also under pressure from norway
6356397 it was difficult for him to see with the rain
6356398 at half time i told our players to be careful for the spectators i felt it was right to play on
6356399 before i came the team had lost games and some players didnt want to come back but now the senior players are happy and that is good for morale its important for us to have belief
6356400 poland won the tournament with a 3 0 win over bulgaria and we should never have lost to them in the semi final
6356401 we didnt create and werent as productive around the box as we were at the milk cup so we didnt do enough to win the game but we certainly didnt deserve to lose it 1 0
6356402 the goal came from an unforced error and that has really been the story for us
6356403 we made mistakes which proved costly against a strong ukraine side who were capable of capitalising on mistakes
6356404 we did well to get back into the game with a good goal from a corner after conceding two in the first 20 minutes
6356405 we said at half time when it was 2 1 that whoever got the next goal would get a real boost they got it and went on to finish strongly
6356406 so many times ive imagined killing him and then killing myself
6356407 a young innocent boy who turned into a monster and a country so full of promise transformed into a concentration camp
6356408 without ever boasting that he was the son of the great leader
6356409 to this day i know nothing of the details of their deaths of whether they blamed me as they perished
6356410 they were sent away to different uninhabited islands in an attempt to end their substandard genes from repeating in a new generation left for dead none of the people made it back home
6356411 if you want to see short people who are suffering from malnutrition you have to go outside the capital ive no reason to doubt this allegation
6356412 today just as he hoped kim vision has been realised
6356413 he has managed to extract resources from wealthier and stronger states by manufacturing crises and generating international instability his brand of nuclear blackmail is a virtual guarantor of bottomless international aid for the worlds most militarised society
6356414 those who have known kim jong il since youth are bound to see him as human not the centre of a god like cult of personality
6356415 i who became a university professor thanks to his father i who travelled to russia seoul and now washington i no longer loathe him i pity him even though he killed my family i have already forgiven him
6356416 they didnt play like the same players who perform week in week out in the premier league what are we doing to them
6356417 we have one of the finest midfielders in steven gerrard he plays for liverpool and he is like roy of the rovers he shoots he scores he tackles he is not a left midfielder it is unbelievable he has to be in the centre we are killing gerrard
6356418 sometimes when the czechs counter attacked we suffered a lot and we have to repair that problem
6356419 i am concerned by a lot of the things i saw the goals we conceded were shocking defending
6356420 there was indecision it was schoolboy stuff we are lacking senior players in that area and it does not look like we are going to get our injured players back for the world cup games next month
6356421 a lot of people were given them in the 16th century but there were none left as they were all melted down except for the one worn by the lord mayor of london whose provenance goes back to 1520 but its only 10 to 20 per cent original and the rest of it has been added or repaired
6356422 this one has had metallurgic tests and is 100 per cent original
6356423 its provenance had been traced to the 1700s but in tests it was found that it is gold alloy which was only used between 1546 and 1552
6356424 the idea of handing these chains down was thought to have been started by john of gaunt during the reign of richard ii i have traced it back to the wife of edward iii who was the daughter of the king of france who had a brooch with the letters on it and she gave it to her son john of gaunt who used it as livery
6356425 we are thrilled for them it is a fantastic opportunity for these children as even though they have performed in shows at the inec before its a huge honour for them to have been chosen to be part of a west end production
6356426 i have been playing tevye in this show since february and its wonderful that it is now going to be in kerry as i know the county fairly well
6356427 there are some lovely hilarious moments in the show but unusually for a musical fiddler has a downbeat ending as it is based on a real event its not your usual fluff and feathers
6356428 im looking forward to getting the walking boots on and getting out and about

6356438 the correspondence i have received from minister gormley which told of the establishment of an inter departmental committee to examine the issue of funding for killarney house leads me to believe that what lies ahead is a series of prolonged talks about talks
6356439 the development of killarney house has been dithered over for too long and while i acknowledge that the minister has taken keen interest in the matter extended debates and discussions go no way to ensuring that proper action will be taken
6356440 killarney house has the potential to be a valuable asset not just to killarney but to tourism in ireland and the disregard that it is being shown is a disgrace not just to our heritage but to the mcshain and the browne families who so generously donated it to the state
6356441 the committee is considering all options including an initial need to undertake remedial repairs to the structure of the building involving mainly roof and window repairs and to enhance its external appearance these works would be appropriate regardless of the future longer term plans for the house
6356442 as far as im concerned i thought we passed the ball well we frustrated limited chances created but you always get that away from home
6356443 the youngster getting sent off was a bit harsh and then we had to change our minds as far as the system was concerned overall i thought it was a great exercise and a blueprint of what im looking for away from home which is to pick a point up at least
6356444 i thought in the circumstances being a friendly i thought the first challenge was enthusiasm from the youngster and the second one was innocuous really its a friendly been hurt but the referees made a decision we can live with that
6356445 but i feel sorry for the boy because i thought he did extremely well and hell remember that for the rest of his life that he made his international debut against scotland did well and unfortunately got sent off
6356446 weve got to go into their slovakias backyard like we did to scotlands backyard tonight wednesday and if we do that we can get a good result but theres a lot of hard work to be done

6356456 it is stated that it has a capacity for 490 people which is a very intense use in a relatively small town so even in the even of permission being given it is problematic as to whether numbers using the premises would significantly increase
6356457 on the other hand major improvements could occur in relation to sound proofing which would benefit the area quite considerably in my view the benefits clearly outweigh the alternative do nothing strategy

6356475 i dont see why cycling is not on the school curriculum if you have swimming on the core school curriculum why not cycling
6356476 how many of us as parents would let our kids ride on the public roads in britain children need safety and skills and if cycling was on the curriculum as a key life skill so that every kid in britain rides a bike that would be a massive boost to the sport of cycling
6356477 that moment when a parent first pushes their kid off on their bike without stabilisers is a memorable one and weve all done it its an accessible sport and weve all done it you can do it with the family it doesnt cost that much to do its straightforward ride a bike to burn more calories and eat a little bit less and youll solve child obesity issues but you have to find the right facility and make it fun for kids
6356478 facilities are something that at an elite level we dont have a problem with theyre not a limiting factor but they are needed for family cycling kids going out with their parents closed road circuits for grass roots racing
6356479 i have only one request in terms of a legacy from all this that they keep that bmx track i only got planning until august 29 and im supposed to knock it down and pay for the dirt to be carried away i cant do that so sir howard bernstein the chief exec of manchester needs to keep it for us thats shanazes track all the local kids can put down their knives and guns in that corner of manchester and come and ride their bikes maybe if we did a bit more of that they wouldnt go back to their guns and knives

6356508 we frequently use the classifieds for current client requirements in the hope that there is a seller who might prefer a discreet transaction or to save marketing costs
6356509 if a seller has a suitable unflawed property we may well have a client who would pay full price we are a little more successful with these ads in the current climate because the best houses wont be put on the open market right now if a potential seller sees our ad they may decide to call
6356510 we struggle to find buyers at the bottom end but someone further up the chain may buy the lowest rung as an investment
6356511 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can

6356522 mobileme is suppose to be microsoft exchange for the rest of us but microsoft exchange does things in a secure manner
6356523 as it is if you run a business using your mac then you cannot use mobileme because it transmits data insecurely

6356540 we were selling bottled water for 1 75 dollars per liter right next to a public drinking fountain that dispensed water for less than an eighth of a cent per liter
6356541 it just didnt make sense to sell water in a bottle when it is so readily available from the tap at a much lower cost
6356542 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6356543 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great

6356557 asia fx is reaping gains on the back of the dollars soft tone

6356579 if you want programs to continue and grow instead of being cut back the only way to make that happen is to get more revenue
6356580 people are concerned about how the budget cuts affect programs important to them
6356581 what weve heard at these meetings is real because these are the people who feel the cuts
6356582 we can make up some of that by being more efficient but we cant make up 1 billion out of an 18 billion budget without cutting into the meat and the bone
6356583 people walk down the middle of the turn lane to get to the store
6356584 weve found that seniors the newly retirees have more income than the seniors of 15 to 20 years ago they like travel exercise theyre more involved in the community they may come by here and grab a meal and then go on to what their interests are theyre not the kind who come and sit and stay the day playing cards or dominoes

6356598 we are not getting as many guests during this olympic period as everyone expected
6356599 maybe it is because more hotels have opened maybe its because hotels have greatly increased their room rates

6356623 when we had rainfall events earlier this year irrigators conformed to the rules
6356624 they were able to take water from that system and take water for crop usage
6356625 i believe the waters there the governments indicated they dont think it is well lets have that tested
6356626 this emphasises yet again why it is so important that we move to managing the murray darling basin as a whole basin
6356627 if words were water we would have had plenty of floods by now so we certainly need our federal government to stand up and make some hard decisions
6356628 we envisage that people will wake up that there is a system a murray darling system thats worth saving
6356629 the accelerated buy back is important the water audit is important but ultimately the reason that weve got this independent commission to set the cap on the whole system is because of what weve seen happening

6356665 what is the overall price range for this type of service
6356666 i spoke with her it was a private conversation but weve exchanged numbers and weve put all our previous troubles in the past so id wish only the best for her
6356667 it is very emotional and im really sad when you spend time with somebody whether theyre good bad or ugly you know the person and when you know them you wouldnt wish something bad to happen to them
6356668 i thought about her family and when i spoke to her she said you know im really worried for my children ive been through a lot in my life but this is the worst
6356669 it was so sad you wouldnt wish this on your enemy and jade isnt my enemy i felt very helpless
6356670 i hope i stay in contact with her and im not saying that for effect i had no idea she had some clue that she might be ill when she went into the house
6356671 i thought maybe it was luck the disease had been picked up during some routine health check shed had done for the show
6356672 shes already been through so much and nobody deserves to go through that much in a life
6356673 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6356674 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
6356675 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case

6356679 i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch
6356680 i try to do just 1 200 calories a day
6356681 im starting to feel more relaxed about acting in english now but it takes time and i have to work very hard on it

6356683 due to such co operation he was at the top of al qaedas target list and dodged three assassination attempts
6356684 we only wish the coalition government that will now have to govern has shown signs that it is up to the job
6356685 his government co operated in the capture of 9 11 plotters ramzi binalshibh and khalid sheikh mohammed among others and he put dr aq khan a scientist involved in nuclear proliferation under house arrest he defused tensions with india and appears to have cut off terror infiltration routes across kashmir due to such co operation musharraf was at the top of al qaedas target list and dodged three assassination attempts
6356686 however like other military men who take power in coups he was a clumsy politician he struck a deal in 2006 with tribal chiefs along the border with afghanistan creating a sanctuary for the taliban which is now resurgent and threatening both countries and he turned a blind eye to seminaries that were breeding grounds for jihadists
6356687 he also misjudged pakistans public mood inflaming the opposition last year with his decision to fire the countrys highest ranking judge jailing lawyers and civic leaders and declaring martial law those decisions squandered whatever legitimacy the general had built in restoring order after the last chaotic democratic government

6356695 sponges have one of the most ancient lineages and dont have nerve cells
6356696 so we are pretty confident it was after the sponges split from trunk of the tree of life and sponges went one way and animals developed from the other that nerves started to form
6356697 what we found in sponges though were the building blocks for nerves something we never expected to find
6356698 what we have done is try to find the molecular building blocks of nerves or what may be called the nerves ancestor the proto neuron
6356699 we found sets of these genes in sponges when we really didnt expect it
6356700 but what was really cool is we took some of these genes and expressed them in frog and flies and the sponge gene became functional the sponge gene directed the formation of nerves in these more complex animals

6356724 sur notre radar nous avions 2 navires dont nous savions quils taient occup s par des pirates
6356725 donc la menace est r elle cest presque myst rieux de descendre la c te et de voir un contact radar avec un nom c t et de savoir que ces navires sont retenus par des pirates
6356726 la vie des membres d quipage est en danger et des ran ons de millions de sont exig es des compagnies propri taires
6356727 le risque de sapprocher trop pr s ou de tenter de contacter les navires attaqu s est que si nous les mena ons ils peuvent penser que nous appartenons aux commandos de marine qui viennent pour tenter un sauvetage et nous risquons davoir des otages morts
6356728 ils connaissent visiblement tr s bien loc an ils sortent par une m t o assez mauvais et sarrangent pour aborder ces gros navires
6356729 g n ralement ils menacent les navires de tirer des roquettes des mortiers ou des armes de poing donc ils montrent leur force les forcent ralentir et ils ont construit des chelles quils accrochent sur le c t des navires pour embarquer
6356730 nous allons ensuite rejoindre un gros navire venant dafrique du sud et lescorter vers mogadiscio et revenir ici pour le 3 donc nous avons des journ es tr s charg es devant nous
6356731 il ny a aucun pirate qui dispose des syst mes n cessaires pour sattaquer un b timent de guerre
6356732 il est simplement impossible quils puissent essayer de faire a
6356733 aucun des navires des autres pays qui ont escort les cargaisons du pam na jamais vu de pirates
6356734 pour de petites embarcations un b timent de guerre de cette taille qui est aussi bien arm il est tr s improbable que des pirates lapprochent et sils le font je ne pense pense quils sapprochent des navires du pam la pr sence visuelle va probablement les dissuader avant que quelquun ne fasse quoi que ce soit
6356735 nous sommes sous lequateur donc la chaleur est tr s forte pendant la journ e
6356736 la fr gate est la principale arme nous allons rester pr t pour prot ger la nourriture et l quipage

6356738 our findings provide a basis for opening up new therapeutic approaches to protect neurons from inflammation and toxicity induced neurodegeneration
6356739 selective cox 2 inhibitors were thought to be a promising medicine in treating neurodegenerative diseases stroke cancers and inflammation related diseases like arthritis however the occurrence of a series of cardiovascular complications in patients receiving cox 2 inhibitors has led to their recent withdrawal from the market and limits on their usages
6356740 therefore elevation of endogenous 2 ag levels by facilitating its production inhibiting its decomposition or directly supplying 2 ag may result in treatment advances to prevent the devastation of disorders like stroke alzheimers and traumatic brain injury

6356762 why would batsheva do such and such doesnt she know that will just hurt her chances with the other women
6356763 instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralised facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6356764 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive
6356765 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 4 800 an ounce
6356766 and if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6356767 as gasoline prices continue to rise hydrogen produced from renewable sources such as bio liquids will be more and more competitive also the possibility of using hydrogen in fuel cells will provide much higher efficiency than internal combustion engines can so the actual cost in dollars per mile may already be lower
6356768 rather than being a clean alternative to fossil fuels biofuels are actually increasing carbon dioxide emissions hydrogen fuelled cars are still a long way off the immediate priority for cutting emissions is smarter cars that burn less fuel
6356769 the day off would probably do me good right now but im still going to have a crack at it hopefully the adrenalin will kick in tomorrow and i wont be able to feel it

6356878 i like the fact that it reaches out to those outside of the literary world this is a wise decision and proves a good way to educate others about new things

6356895 im not going to say we played our best half of lacrosse but it was definitely the hardest half of lacrosse we played all year long that was a huge turning point for this team to be able to come out and win a game like that against the defending champion

6356897 ive learned in this league that its all about finding the right guys and right players to play with
6356898 in talking to the guys on the riptide i knew it was a place i would be able to have a lot of success
6356899 the offseason was an absolute emotional roller coaster for us it was just one positive after a negative to another positive that just kept going
6356900 the cool thing about our offense is that you dont know when chazz woodson is going to jump over someone or greg downing is going to run through four or five people to the goal or someone else is going to make a spectacular play
6356901 if one guy is feeling it we let him create we have great midfielders on our team and we can really break people down but the midfield doesnt have to score we can create and get the ball to some incredible shooters
6356902 with limited practice time and new guys on every team there is always a feeling out process

6356915 absolutely we were last in the world in kickoff returns were emphasizing that
6356916 i dont know that we ever put all of the blocks together that you need to spring one
6356917 its probably a reminder of how good the guy was before
6356918 its not just the returners although thats all that most people ever see
6356919 we need to tighten up we obviously know our numbers have been down and we want to improve on that
6356920 last year we didnt play as well as we could our blocking and other things we could have done better on kickoff returns and things like that so hes stressing those right now
6356921 at this difficult time for retailers and family budgets its vital that the government acts to restore economic stability
6356922 whether its been fighting off relegation or striving for promotion its been a bit of a rollercoaster but through it all the club has become stronger playing membership has doubled and in the last six months in particular our facilities have been vastly improved
6356923 last year was a disappointment but we bounced straight back before and although it will probably be tougher this time theres no reason why we cant do it again
6356924 as well retaining the core of last years team there are more new faces to come
6356925 we also now of course have our own home grown lads to call on as well including jeff foulkes nick judd dean swift shane sparrow anthony harden dan woodward and joe gee

6356931 i only wish it well its a terrific place full of terrific people
6356932 weve moved the organisation on leaps and bounds and thats really important to me
6356933 if i have a genuine legacy we were sitting in a big stadium last night its probably one of the finest in the world and the respect programme is very special to me
6356934 in this sort of job you have an opportunity to make a difference and if i in a very small way improved behaviour on and off the pitch thatll do me
6356935 we have got just less than two weeks but i am hopeful we can sign some players we are still actively trying to get some people in
6356936 i have the support from the chairman randy lerner who has shown his intentions and done exactly what he said he would in supporting the team
6356937 we might get another three players in and we might be stricken with the same situation as west ham this time last year
6356938 we were very lucky this guy was stopped and nobody was killed yesterday
6356939 einmal einen guten teil der welt am laufen hielten ohne allzu ernsthaft an arbeit denken zu m ssen
6356940 meines erachtens setzt alles gezwungene in der kleidung einen mangel an verstand voraus der unterschied zwischen einem weltmann und einem gecken besteht darin dass der geck sich etwas auf seine kleidung einbildet indes der weltmann ber ihn l chelt und schweigt

6356945 could not be more excited about what this financing being made by such a knowledgeable group of investors means for us and for the future of renewable energy
6356946 its about the transformative nature of engineered geothermal systems google atv and vulcan are very savvy investors pretty good at sorting out what are smart bets and what are unattractive bets it confirms what we think about the market and it shows a general acceptance of the need for renewables by the broader financial markets
6356947 we require water upfront to do the fracturing but that lasts for a week or 10 days
6356948 engineered geothermal is capital intensive but youre buying upfront the lifetime cost of your plant geothermal is considered non cost volatile so utilities are very positive and receptive to it
6356949 it is an honor to work with don his expertise will help us provide our clients with the very highest echelon of experience and knowledge across the spectrum of disease management in respiratory disease

6356951 providing items for healthcare professionals use that do not advance disease or treatment education even if they are practice related items of minimal value such as pens note pads mugs and similar reminder items with company or product logos may foster misperceptions that company interactions with health care professionals are not based on informing them about medical and scientific issues

6356954 its an honor to be recognized by crains especially for innovation of our work
6356955 we developed the system to address the real problems we encountered every day but these are problems every practice experiences by making our solution available to the public we hope to help other doctors significantly improve the quality of care they provide

6356957 many physicians use locum tenens as a way in which to find their ideal practice opportunity
6356958 practices who utilize locum tenens have the opportunity to work with and observe a possible candidate its a win win for both parties involved

6357000 with such a high demand we usually place our nurses within one day to three weeks
6357001 and on average traveling nurses can stay in an area as little as 90 days to as long as a year or more
6357002 a common misconception is that if you travel you do not have job security or benefits neither is true
6357003 each of our nurses receives a comprehensive benefits package on every assignment
6357004 many dialysis nurses use traveling to get a wider variety of experiences in different locations in the end traveling nurses often have more control over the direction of their career than most traditional nurses

6357018 david swann in the past has shown a strong leftist inclination but in the last few months hes actually shown a kind of willingness to adopt a much more pragmatic stance
6357019 dave taylor offers a more forthright centre centre right choice for the party he would be in my mind more in tune with where albertans are politically
6357020 albertas weak retail activity in june continues a trend toward more moderate sales that has been ongoing for most of the year
6357021 albertans continue to spend more per person than elsewhere in the country but that per capita level is gradually coming in line with the national average
6357022 the softer sales are more an indication of shoppers simply taking a breather rather than economic malaise
6357023 instead of being out in the malls albertans are spending more time riding their new vehicles wearing their new clothes and watching their new flat screen tvs that they bought last year
6357024 while the latest results are far from impressive we will note that canadian retail sales managed to rise at a slightly faster pace than in the u s in the three months to june six per cent versus 5 6 per cent that was despite the wind aided assistance of tax rebates stateside and was through the heart of spiking gasoline prices both countries saw small gains excluding service stations over that stretch
6357025 reeling it in after a couple years of very powerful activity softer job conditions a cooling housing market still high gas prices and a raft of dire headlines have hammered consumer confidence pointing to more modest spending growth in the months ahead even so the outlook remains less downbeat than that facing the ultra stressed u s consumer

6357027 qui in costiera erano tutti piatti fuori luogo non rimpiango niente di prodotti che non ci appartengono usati in modo slegato dalle nostre tradizioni alcuni credevano chic andare a mangiare le farfalle alla polpa di granchio ma nella nostra famiglia continuavamo a frequentare quelle belle trattorie e per fortuna ce nerano che hanno resistito alle mode preparando ancora un corretto pesce al forno o la buona carne quella si da rimpiangere visto che oggi non se ne trova facilmente di quella qualit di coniglio o pollo ruspante
6357028 in effetti stato facile usarla ovunque e da chiunque quindi stata usata male ma la demonizzazione eccessiva nel mio ristorante non la uso se non per la pasticceria perch faccio una cucina di territorio e non rientra nelle tradizioni romane per non ricordo malvolentieri i

6357030 i left a very special situation at marquette when indiana offered me this opportunity
6357031 i wanted to make sure that if i left i would be going to a place that would be a destination for my family and allow me to build a program for the long haul with the same security
6357032 the process of restoring this great program is going to take a lot of time more than probably any of us anticipated
6357033 i dont know why he would give this statement unless he just misunderstood or misremembered
6357034 i said well you cant be with our program youve put our program in harms way
6357035 i never even went into his office to sign any papers dealing with this whole incident
6357036 ive never been to coach pruetts office period as far as anything dealing with a job hes never approached me about a job
6357037 i may not have understood everything that i did sign off on
6357038 my brother was dying of cancer i wanted to see him
6357039 my grandson was a junior in high school i wanted to watch him play i wanted to help my son coach it was just time it was of my own volition
6357040 i do think there is some relief that comes with the filing of the report it allows us to bring closure to what is a sad and embarassing situation for the university
6357041 when theyre out on the road themselves and doing this sort of thing theyre trying to recruit the best they can sometimes you lose sight of whats important i think theyre two great guys who made some serious mistakes
6357042 all institutions are cautioned that due diligence must be exercised prior to accepting courses from fresno pacific for academic credit and athletic eligibility purposes
6357043 we are extremely disappointed and frustrated that the committee on infractions refused to look at all the evidence in a fair and equitable way
6357044 what they do is take your statement by ambush the enforcement staff shows up on your door will not give you the opportunity to look at any documents look at any phone records they try to almost force you into a lie and then they can come back and charge you with unethical conduct after they put you in that position
6357045 over 7 000 members of the samiti courted arrest under the all india jail bharo fill the jails agitation
6357046 i had some fun with ur so gay its also about guys with guy liner that use flat irons its just a saying its like calling someone a b h youre like hey b h it just felt appropriate

6357048 its an anthem for power of the people for females gays exes anybody whos been broken up with that wants to get over a guy
6357049 im sure they opt out of singing i kissed a girl or ur so gay but theyre singing along to every other song on the record theyre just glad im not strung out doing centrefolds and s t like that
6357050 i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock it promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
6357051 she is our daughter and we love her but we strongly disagree with how she is conducting herself and she knows how disappointed we are

6357060 rallying together to denounce apple in offering songs for tibet for purchase
6357061 the predictably hostile response to the album from chinese internet users as reported by an official chinese media outlet reflects continued attempts to suppress any support for tibet at a time of crisis for the tibetan people as well as the level of entrenched misinformation about tibet propagated by the beijing government among the chinese public
6357062 thanks to this generous grant we can work with experts in automatic speech recognition and in brain imaging at other universities to research a brain computer interface with applications in military medical and commercial settings

6357066 i cant get into specifics other than to say it is not uncommon during a course of an investigation that a sum of money is paid for information
6357067 was attempting to make contact with an unknown party at ubc with whom he could discuss the stolen items and a possible reward for their return
6357068 right now theres a business whereby criminals are actually stealing with the hopes of being paid ransom rewards for what they steal
6357069 however when there are only dead ends in a case what do we do
6357070 it is a fact that insurance companies are often successful in negotiating the recovery of stolen art works where law enforcement agencies may not be
6357071 if access to diagnosis is universal why isnt access to drugs
6357072 the current health system is universal only in half measures if we were diagnosing the problem we would say it suffers from hemianopsia
6357073 why reinvent the wheel instead we should be looking at how this program could be applied elsewhere in canada
6357074 the cma is strongly supportive of pharmacare and so is the cna we know how important this is for our patients
6357075 canadian nurses believe in a not for profit public health care system we dont believe privatization will improve efficiency effectiveness and access the solutions lie elsewhere
6357076 but we need to pull our heads out of the sand and acknowledge that private health care exists almost everywhere in the world it exists in canada and even to a greater extent in quebec
6357077 his way of practising medicine is far removed from the day to day reality of the vast majority of most canadian physicians
6357078 and the solutions he is proposing are far removed from what most canadians want they dont want the wealthy to get better faster access to care
6357079 we believe the plan we have developed is the most cost effective means available to address the matter of dangerous dilapidated buildings
6357080 as a result of todays talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6357081 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members
6357082 the proportion of youth reporting being sexually active decreased during this period
6357083 they may be using oral sex as a substitute for intercourse
6357084 the trend is a positive one for safer sexual behaviour
6357085 clearly people are continuing to have sex in an unsafe manner
6357086 if people are reporting this much condom use i would question whether they are being used properly
6357087 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taleban
6357088 you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain

6357165 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july

6357175 i made the first one in my garage just for personal use with our children but the response from other parents prompted us to file for a patent and create a new product for families on the go
6357176 for the last year evan and i have been designing and building the prototype creating a company looking for financing and a manufacturer in addition to raising our 5 kids
6357177 popatot was born while camping with the family last year stacy and i found it difficult to keep the baby in a safe place while we setup camp cooked over the fire and watched the other four kids
6357178 so while sitting around the fire late one night we developed the concept on a paper sack almost unbelievably it will be delivered around labor day
6357179 its safe for my children and so simple to use
6357180 no more lugging multiple play sets and toys we just grab the popatot with the toys already in place and off we go its perfect when i go to my moms house

6357219 im much happier after this performance this was a big test of character for us and i wasnt sure before the game if enough of the players possessed the character to be here

6357221 if the saying about only being as good as your last game is true then we werent very good before tonights match the players had a lot to prove we see them every day in training and so we know how good they are but they have to keep showing they have what it takes to wear the red shirt

6357239 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6357240 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6357241 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6357242 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6357243 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6357244 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6357245 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6357246 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6357247 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6357248 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6357249 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6357250 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6357251 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6357252 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6357253 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6357254 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6357255 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6357256 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6357257 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6357258 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6357259 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6357260 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6357261 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6357262 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6357263 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6357264 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6357265 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6357266 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6357267 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6357268 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6357269 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6357270 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6357271 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6357272 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6357273 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6357274 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6357275 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6357276 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6357277 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6357278 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6357279 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6357280 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6357281 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6357282 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6357283 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6357284 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6357285 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6357286 who are open to doing something on the production side
6357287 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6357288 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6357289 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6357290 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6357291 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6357292 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

6357310 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6357311 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6357312 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6357313 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6357314 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

6357320 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6357321 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6357322 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6357336 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6357337 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6357338 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6357339 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6357340 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6357341 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6357342 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6357343 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6357344 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6357345 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6357346 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6357347 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6357348 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6357349 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6357350 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6357351 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6357352 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6357353 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6357354 nothing has been done to implement the agreement on the ground
6357355 might be useful to come out at this stage and get an update and be able to go back and brief the president
6357356 its a very gratifying time because were in a position where we believe were going to be able to hand most security functions to the iraqis
6357357 all of the reports and rumors and chatter it really ought to be ignored

6357365 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

6357389 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6357390 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6357391 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6357392 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back

6357433 oh itd be a risk using some technology that doesnt have a huge user base so that its cheap and easy to find and hire developers
6357434 there is anecdotal evidence that kids get inspired when they see their olympic heroes do well
6357435 often many gold medalists will say they were inspired by seeing former sporting heroes do well i guess that is the impact the government would hope to get out of this
6357436 all the inspiration doesnt make up for a lack of facilities
6357437 there is a complete dearth of facilities here compared with somewhere like australia
6357438 i think the lack of facilities here just leads to kids hanging about on the streets with nowhere to go
6357439 in terms of olympic medals the thing that probably gets you furthest is spending and focusing resources on athletes who have come forward who are doing well
6357440 but you have to believe the majority of the people otherwi
6357441 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later i dont think they need any more additional time

6357450 i think we now have very convincing evidence that prdm16 can turn cells into brown fat cells with the possibility of combating obesity

6357491 typically when neuropsychological tests are used for diagnostic purposes an individuals level of performance on specific tests is measured against healthy individuals to determine cognitive impairment
6357492 however this approach does not take into account intraindividual variability in cognitive function
6357493 we know that level of performance on tests of memory attention and executive function predicts dementia however this study showed for the first time that the degree of variability in performance across neuropsychological tests measured within a person improved the prediction of dementia above and beyond ones level of performance on each test alone
6357494 of the 897 participants there were 61 cases of dementia 6 8 percent identified during the follow up period which on average was 3 3 years
6357495 this figure is in line with what wed expect for the incidence of dementia in this population
6357496 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
6357497 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
6357498 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
6357499 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function

6357501 the illegal purchase of alcohol by young people is a significant problem in the uk
6357502 if the scottish government wants to tackle scotlands drinking problem it needs a comprehensive strategy that is fully resourced and followed through we need to let retailers and the drinks industry know we mean business selling to alcohol to under 18s and irresponsible alcohol promotion will not be ignored in scotland any longer
6357503 companies that hold on to these incorrect assumptions run the risk of increased turnover reduced productivity and limited engagement in other words business as usual
6357504 the cost of doing nothing is far greater than the cost of a well designed and quickly implemented assessment program
6357505 inflation is eating into student spending power at an incredible rate and for those heading off to university this year the increased cost of basic goods is likely to come as a nasty surprise
6357506 students need to ensure that theyre budgeting carefully in all areas and should ensure that they have a competitive student account offering a good interest free overdraft and other benefits
6357507 my goal was to continue to work and not let them tell me rockys going to come back faster
6357508 that just wasnt going to happen to me after working hard and seeing how my knee was feeling out here i knew i could get back
6357509 it think its a real tribute to them and any player thats had to go through a severe injury the long road back way back in february when they were trying to motivate each other i think it was hard to visualize what it will be like when you finally do get back and now theyre realizing it
6357510 but just us having the same injuries we were out there trying to work hard compete against each other and so far so good
6357511 as a corner i think the sleeve will hold me back
6357512 if its going to swell up its going to swell up with or without the sleeve the sleeve aint going to stop somebody from hitting me im just going to go out there like ive never had anything wrong
6357513 i couldve been to the pro bowl instead of dropping about 10 picks
6357514 i was starting to have a really good season last year then came the injury now im back so i need to have a really good year im anxious to go out there and show the real carlos
6357515 i was khary for a little minute but you guys got me
6357516 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
6357517 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
6357518 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
6357519 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
6357520 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
6357521 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
6357522 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
6357523 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
6357524 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
6357525 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school

6357555 we are working to see that the face of health care is changing as well
6357556 blacks and latinos have much higher incidences of obesity heart disease diabetes and many other treatable and preventable health problems blacks and latinos also are often clustered in communities that are more toxic that have more health hazards present and yet also have significantly fewer health care providers in or near those communities our mission at the urban health program goes beyond just training black latino and native american health care providers we are dedicated to helping solve these disparities we encourage our students to work in the communities that need them most
6357557 the urban health program is a model for other colleges and universities around the country when it comes to attracting and graduating a cadre of black latino and native american students for the health professions

6357590 probably to get us here a little quicker and it worked
6357591 is this a typical situation for you when you get into one of these hot situations
6357592 first thing im going to ask anybody out here right now is if they know anything about people shooting at police you just never know
6357593 give me a sense of the advantages of the ntf to make the streets safer
6357594 well the advantage is saturation of one area with 40 officers
6357595 poland is obviously the favourite but i believe we have a chance against everyone well be doing our best to cause an upset
6357596 it would be unbelievable it wont be easy but were improving all the time i hope we can do it over the next two years
6357597 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
6357598 you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6357599 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6357600 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6357601 you make our country proud every day of the week and every week of the year you are truly the heroes of our country
6357602 i wish to say how proud i am of you today
6357603 weve got to be prepared for anything that may happen
6357604 i spoke with her it was a private conversation but weve exchanged numbers and weve put all our previous troubles in the past so id wish only the best for her
6357605 it is very emotional and im really sad when you spend time with somebody whether theyre good bad or ugly you know the person and when you know them you wouldnt wish something bad to happen to them
6357606 i thought about her family and when i spoke to her she said you know im really worried for my children ive been through a lot in my life but this is the worst
6357607 it was so sad you wouldnt wish this on your enemy and jade isnt my enemy i felt very helpless
6357608 i hope i stay in contact with her and im not saying that for effect i had no idea she had some clue that she might be ill when she went into the house
6357609 i thought maybe it was luck the disease had been picked up during some routine health check shed had done for the show
6357610 die ganze geschichte ist eine einzige farce fast schon comedy
6357611 we have had these shutdowns ever since the shrine land row started
6357612 protesters used to shout slogans on the streets protests and agitations are staged everywhere we have been suffering for the past one and a half months our studies have suffered a lot
6357613 worship me or suffer the why do the christians say that christianity is about love when in fact all the preach is fear en espa ol
6357614 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 dollars an ounce
6357615 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6357616 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations
6357617 so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6357618 so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6357619 worship me or suffer the why do the christians say that christianity is about love when in fact all the preach is fear en espa ol
6357620 we looked at what we could do to address them and the whole area of air quality as it relates to the emission of ammonia from poultry houses
6357621 weve certainly been on a learning curve since 2001 about the different plant materials suitable for this practice we typically recommend the first row nearest the fans to be either a deciduous tree or a tree with a waxy leaf surface and the other two rows be an evergreen
6357622 one initial concern was that it takes years for trees to grow to become effective in filtering out poultry house emissions but thats not necessarily the case
6357623 when they separated the dolphins were never again able to return and reproduce

6357626 the air dropping of relief materials finally began a day after chief minister nitish kumar took a decision to engage iaf helicopters following an aerial survey of the flood hit districts wednesday
6357627 nearly 60 personnel of national disaster management force will reach bihar by thursday evening to join the rescue operations along with special auxiliary police personnel in supaul saharsa madhepura and araria districts which are worst hit by the floods
6357628 floodwaters entered several villages in forbesganj in araria purnea and supaul districts wednesday
6357629 there was need to impose curfew wednesday because the jammu agitators had threatened to bring children on the streets
6357630 coming into this match we knew pretty much all year that it could come down to a u s chinese final
6357631 we knew that china would be going for it in this olympic games
6357632 we need to remember that u s beach volleyball has enjoyed a long history and development in china its still pretty new
6357633 they were too strong too competitive so the best thing we could do was relax
6357634 i believe that our leaders and coaches of the national team also have increased their support and financial input thats why we have been able to achieve this result
6357635 i believe that today we have made a historical breakthrough in beach volleyball
6357636 they dont worry about the rubber falling off the paddle
6357637 the effect is one of increasing the speed and spin when you contact the ball
6357638 one of our players melted down in a previous competition because the match in front of her was delayed
6357639 because the glue has no power the ball drops a lot
6357640 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts with more curves
6357641 this is not a copy of a pc on tv
6357642 we are setting a new bar and delivering a richer internet experience to tv like never before
6357643 who shot jr beam me up scotty youre fired and good night and good luck you know these lines better than i do
6357644 i dont have to name the show or the stars why because we all want and we all love tv
6357645 in the past the idea was to put the browser on tv and use a text based interface which would interfere with the programme
6357646 this leaves the user in the environment they are comfortable with which is watching tv
6357647 companies still spend five times as much ad money on the tv as the web
6357648 advertising is sold more effectively on tv the problem with tv is that everyone sees the same ad
6357649 it puts tv not on an even footing with the internet as a mass medium but it could potentially leapfrog it because of the improved dynamic of the big screen audio experience
6357650 up until now there has been no consistent architecture to do this well
6357651 no de facto platform to fuse the internet with tv
6357652 for the first time we are bringing the full richness of the internet and web 2 0 and optimising the tv while respecting the tvs unique attributes simplicity easy of use socialising and entertainment value all the things that people love about tv
6357653 if you look at these things what they boil down to is is it compelling to use am i as a consumer going to sit on my couch with my very expensive tv and think wow i really want to go and look at the weather
6357654 as we have seen a lot of people are doing that with their laptop on their knee during the olympics or the superbowl which is inconvenient and involves just one person
6357655 so getting to the stage where you can bring some of that functionality to the tv without it being disruptive to the viewing experience is what has been missing to date
6357656 we are behind soren like a rock not only will our nine mlas support him on the floor of the house but we will also make efforts to make him the chief minister
6357657 i hope this medal can be a message of peace in afghanistan

6357660 it is indeed a big honour and a matter of great happiness for all of afghanistan for this is the first time an afghan athlete has managed to win a medal

6357663 a privileged regime of association with polynesia shares forum leaders official
6357664 any initiative aiming to reinforce and promote regional cooperation and integration in order to maximize available resources and improve the effectiveness of our joint action for the benefit of our populations
6357665 to be marginalized or left alone facing the forces of nature
6357666 is particularly attentive to the concerns of the smaller island developing states which are more vulnerable to external natural or economic shocks
6357667 within the scope of its human technical financial and institutional resources
6357668 experience and expertise in the areas of health water sanitation education and research
6357669 climate change skyrocketing oil prices overexploitation of sea resources and a widening digital gap
6357670 i t is essential that we implement strategies at a regional scale and i am pleased that forum leaders have selected the topic of climate change in their declaration this year
6357671 it is a question of survival and one of the priorities set by my government is to develop all sources of available renewable energy
6357672 from what we learn from this program we will not hesitate to share the experience we gain in this field
6357673 it shares their concerns and joins in their effort to struggle against overfishing and illegal unreported and unregulated fishing
6357674 an amazing opportunity to bridge the digital gap between our islands and i would like here to encourage any international donor to back this project for which
6357675 his untimely death is a major loss not only for the forum but also for the whole pacific community at a time when the region has embarked on crucial reforms for the future
6357676 our priority is establishing who this man is and how he came about his injuries
6357677 officers will be carrying out door to door enquiries in the area and examining cctv footage
6357678 this is not a copy of a pc on tv
6357679 we are setting a new bar and delivering a richer internet experience to tv like never before
6357680 who shot jr beam me up scotty youre fired and good night and good luck you know these lines better than i do
6357681 i dont have to name the show or the stars why because we all want and we all love tv
6357682 in the past the idea was to put the browser on tv and use a text based interface which would interfere with the programme
6357683 this leaves the user in the environment they are comfortable with which is watching tv
6357684 companies still spend five times as much ad money on the tv as the web
6357685 advertising is sold more effectively on tv the problem with tv is that everyone sees the same ad
6357686 it puts tv not on an even footing with the internet as a mass medium but it could potentially leapfrog it because of the improved dynamic of the big screen audio experience
6357687 up until now there has been no consistent architecture to do this well
6357688 no de facto platform to fuse the internet with tv
6357689 for the first time we are bringing the full richness of the internet and web 2 0 and optimising the tv while respecting the tvs unique attributes simplicity easy of use socialising and entertainment value all the things that people love about tv
6357690 if you look at these things what they boil down to is is it compelling to use am i as a consumer going to sit on my couch with my very expensive tv and think wow i really want to go and look at the weather
6357691 as we have seen a lot of people are doing that with their laptop on their knee during the olympics or the superbowl which is inconvenient and involves just one person
6357692 so getting to the stage where you can bring some of that functionality to the tv without it being disruptive to the viewing experience is what has been missing to date
6357693 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6357694 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6357695 whether you think you can or whether you think you cant youre right
6357696 global dairy demand is increasing outstripping supply and consumers are seeing rapidly rising prices
6357697 many of you have written to me to express your disappointment in our moving harry potter and the half blood prince to summer 2009
6357698 please be assured that we share your love for harry potter and would certainly never do anything to hurt any of the films over the past ten years we have nurtured and protected each film and the integrity of the books upon which they are based to the best of our ability
6357699 the decision to move harry potter and the half blood prince was not taken lightly and was never intended to upset our harry potter fans
6357700 we know you have built this series into what it is and we thank you for your ongoing enthusiasm and support
6357701 i am sorry to have disappointed you now but if you hold on a little longer i believe it will be worth the wait
6357702 its a close call as to whether it will be avoided
6357703 there have been many many rumours taking in pretty much every make of bike over the past weeks and months and recently some firmer and firmer sounding ideas but as far as we know nothings actually signed and sealed
6357704 both sides have reached the conclusion that there is no need for any further negotiations a draft agreement is there it is now a political decision
6357705 the improved security in iraq allows us to have conversations with the iraqis about setting goals for more american troops to come home and for the iraqis to take the lead in more combat missions
6357706 any dates in an agreement will be based on conditions on the ground because we do not want to lose the hard fought gains of the surge
6357707 it tells everybody that we are very serious about offering a high quality of care
6357708 there is a critical point beyond which too many cooks in the same kitchen may produce more harm than good
6357709 eventually trauma center patients go to one of many centers rather than a limited number of centers of excellence
6357710 there are zero trauma centers in chinatown which is a neighborhood where people live
6357711 this is really about serving the patients who have come here and will continue to come here
6357712 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain senator mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him
6357713 what he refused to do on behalf of the democratic ticket
6357714 now willing to do on behalf of the republican party
6357715 hes going to iraq but hes already decided his position hes not going to listen to general david petraeus hes not going to listen to our troops i think thats not the kind of leadership we need in the oval office
6357716 senator lieberman has always been there for senator reid even on close votes except for iraq
6357717 we face a very real threat in global terror threats from radical islam nuclear iran
6357718 the coalition of republicans and independents and conservative democrats that ultimately will elect john mccain in the fall
6357719 there was phenomenal excitement when gore picked lieberman in 2000
6357720 it was an extraordinary moment in american jewish history but now that is ancient history
6357721 were a generation who expects all information is a google search away
6357722 not only is it a google search away but its also released immediately as soon as it happens the video is up on youtube and on all the blogs the old model feels kind of crazy when youre used to this instant information
6357723 maybe somebody has discovered some interesting gene and doesnt want to blab to the whole world about why its interesting
6357724 all the gory details of what someone is working on because i dont want my grad students necessarily to be scooped by someone else
6357725 in the same way you couldnt get to facebook until you had the web for 10 years all sorts of stuff had to happen to the web itself to support the emergence of something like facebook
6357726 i think the tipping point will come when scientists look at someone next to them using the open system and getting more discoveries and saying i want that
6357727 the bottom line is its a wonderful experiment but it needs to be approached carefully or you go out of business
6357728 the best thing to do with fresh mozzarella is nothing atall
6357729 people defend their own cheese like they defend their favorite pizzeria
6357730 large creature seven to eight feet tall walking like a gorilla hunched over and making a sound like
6357731 you park up your car for four days arent at home to use any of your electrical equipment are living in a tent and using communal facilities
6357732 its harder to collect sort and recycle rubbish in the wet things get dirty its more difficult and some people just cant be bothered
6357733 ive never seen a cleaner festival than latitude but it already has that thoughtful air to it at reading and leeds the audience profile is younger its is not that they dont care but if doing something good means walking to the recycling point and missing the best band of the night they wont do it
6357734 we make sure all our cups at reading and leeds are paper and theres a 10p deposit on them to encourage people to return them
6357735 we have three or four different types of bin and well station a green messenger at every rubbish point literally directing peoples hands to the right bin otherwise it just becomes a pile of rubbish
6357736 there isnt a huge amount of consumer pressure for them either it is mainly driven by ourselves but the plus factor is that other festivals are following the lead
6357737 as much as three quarters of an events carbon footprint is created by people travelling to the festival
6357738 most organisers are doing as much as they can but its the audience who are going to make the difference
6357739 there is nothing left of the plane it is totally burned
6357740 its the closest to hell ive ever seen the corpses were boiling and we were burned as we retrieved them
6357741 we are on our way to the airport to check the flight list
6357742 we cannot speculate the investigation is the responsibility of the civil aviation authority
6357743 the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away
6357744 to say weve been inspired by charlie morgan and redge is an understatement
6357745 we really like what theyre doing and the way in which theyre going about it
6357746 further more proof of the synergies that are going to spark between us is the fact that they found us through a medium in which we truly believe and had spent a great deal of time ensuring reflected our personality our website
6357747 developed by a young lady who joined draftfcbs digital interactive division as a trainee excelled during her internship and is now a full time employee it features the face of a redline intern who worked with us in the office as part of the practical component of her pr course
6357748 its just so apt that jackal wolf came across the website which really does burst with the pride we take in watching our trainees grow into magic people capable of making a very positive contribution to our business because im sure they felt that we would take the same amount of pride in them
6357749 as we all know music is an integral part of marketing communication particularly television and radio work and increasingly on digital platforms such as the internet and mobile phones the sheer energy and power as well as social commentary of jackal wolfs performance are certain to enhance any ad and give it particular resonance with those who embrace the bands philosophy
6357750 there is a sense of pride that comes from beating the champs
6357751 we know we were a different team four years ago and they were a different team
6357752 of course but effort is not going to be enough
6357753 playing a great game is not going to be enough a lot of things are going to have to blend in together to have an opportunity to win but were going to try
6357754 im glad my duke team doesnt have to play st marys next year
6357755 with the minimum being suspension for the remainder of the season for those involved including our two nationwide series crew chiefs
6357756 there will also be an additional monetary fine beyond the amount announced by nascar which will be the responsibility of those involved
6357757 as they had no knowledge or involvement of this incident
6357758 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6357759 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6357760 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable
6357761 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation
6357762 the whole government logically is affected very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6357763 she said they could see the fire and then it was not even a minute or so they heard something blow up
6357764 they were about 200 meters 660 feet in the air and then they were landing but not crashing they were landing like little by little it was not like they fell down suddenly
6357765 i think we are all a little bit disappointed with how we played there were some pluses and some negatives to take away from the game but overall i think the feeling is disappointment
6357766 i think the fans will be disappointed with what they have seen i think there are three or four positives and maybe four or five negatives from the game
6357767 it is down to the manager now to sit down and address it with the players
6357768 on the next trip weve got 10 days away and if we can address it before those two games and thrash things out before the world cup campaign starts we will be okay
6357769 it is not just this game where there have been problems there have been other games and there will be problems in the future that will occur
6357770 we need to sit down and address it and address it very quickly otherwise it stays around the squad the manager will thrash things out and we will get things off our chest
6357771 that will be very private the manager makes the big decisions we can give our opinion but he is the one who makes those big final decisions
6357772 we are still encouraged by what we can do in zagreb against the czechs we wanted to do better than we did but at the same time there will be points to be played for with andorra and croatia
6357773 hopefully we can get off to a good start and win against andorra and take the confidence to croatia we have to go there and stand up and be counted for
6357774 we want to join the olympians and have great success it has made us very proud
6357775 it was disappointing we didnt play that well but we are not going to win any medals or qualify for world cups in a friendly
6357776 those are the most prevalent but if you have a product catalogue you need to ensure product descriptions are correct and that the price makes sense
6357777 vars will buy more expensive kit than we do we have have the advantage of buying in bulk and because they only sell one server a week they have to make a lot of margin on that
6357778 the smes is a market that has been largely ignored by the large players
6357779 you dont need an it specialist but you do need someone with basic knowledge
6357780 in fact the challenge for us is how will we able to demonstrate how successful weve been if there have been no issues to report

6357788 i believe my last marriage turned me into an alcoholic i was so miserable and stayed in the relationship because of the kids but in the end it was awful for them because we were arguing six or seven years i hid the bottles when youre that depressed you cant even do it stop drinking for your kids thats the most disgusting thing
6357789 were trying every tool i cant tell you how many conversations ive had with diplomats and others i keep stressing to the russians that there are american children who are trapped
6357790 yesterday it was like 20 to 25 miles from us now its 10 miles 10 to 15 miles
6357791 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6357792 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6357793 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6357794 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6357795 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6357796 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6357797 gordon brown compared british troops to olympic heroes today as he made a surprise visit to a british base near the frontline in helmand afghanistan
6357798 gordon brown made an unexpected stopover in afghanistan this morning en route to beijing and told uk soldiers serving at camp bastion that their achievement surpassed even those of britains olympic heroes
6357799 gordon brown has spoken out for the first time over his beleaguered leadership insisting that david miliband does not pose a threat to his position and that he will lead labour to victory in the next general election

6357816 you booted faramir were you able to go online and do whatever you wanted then
6357817 yes yes i started it and it asked me whether to boot windows or linux for some reason there were two linux choices
6357818 i know choosing windows leads to what you know and love but it is slow
6357819 yes i tried that but it was so terrible so slow
6357820 yeah amma it is a really old machine and there is too much stuff on it

6357836 there are so many amazing players that came before us and girls yet to come
6357837 everyone talks about streaks and records and now we really are
6357838 i think its harder being a fan sitting out in the rain than being a player
6357839 this is just another reason why we play in bathing suits
6357840 the rain made it a little more special a little more romantic out there
6357841 you feel like youre a warrior out there battling the elements
6357842 its so deep inside were older now we can appreciate this athens was just an adrenaline rush lightning in a bottle this is more like soulful its wonderful
6357843 this includes the way in which it responds to concerns from the public and how it documents its action taken in response to incidents
6357844 we have also made recommendations to ensure that staff are clear about their roles in a work environment that has seen many changes over the past few years
6357845 we are satisfied that lessons have been learned and the trust is addressing the main concerns by making changes to its systems to reduce the risk of an incident like this being repeated
6357846 challenges ahead but we have made significant improvements in the last 17 months
6357847 im lightweight fast off the line and in the best shape ever

6357860 video line up against the likes of the fall out boy in the best rock video category the band also recently completed a headline stint on the
6357861 iemand anders dacht dat het op vrouwen sloeg maar die had het net uitgemaakt met zijn vriendin de platenindustrie komt ook veel terug we verzinnen vaak iets wat voor ons associatief goed past bij de muziek maar we hebben niet meteen een concrete betekenis achter de hand
6357862 de tour ging goed en er is een stijgende lijn maar het verschil van stad tot stad is bizar soms is het helemaal vol even verderop is er bijna niemand maar al het begin is moeilijk en we blijven ons best doen er is hier terwijl ik met je praat trouwens ontzettend veel interessants te zien ik ben gek op new york met al die aparte figuren
6357863 maar alles wat ik doe wordt beheerst door de emotie die ik voel en in de klassieke muziek is alles volledig uitgeschreven dat is ook een van de redenen dat ik ermee gestopt ben als we spelen dan voel ik wat iedereen in de band aan het doen is en ik probeer dan mee te gaan in de emotie van het moment elke keer als ik een nummer zing beleef ik het alsof het de eerste keer is dat ik het zing
6357864 sommige stukken muziek zijn echt mooi en dat is iets dat we vroeger niet geprobeerd zouden hebben omdat het beschamend zou kunnen zijn
6357865 brendan tobin de gitarist is in een appartement getrokken met een oefenruimte erbij dat van alice donut is geweest hij heeft het uitgebouwd tot een echte studio en daar hebben we de demos van het album opgenomen de band bouwt de songs op uit riffs en baslijnen en als het dan bijna af is kom ik meestal kan ik bij de eerste keer luisteren al vertellen wat ik vocaal wil met het nummer en wat er aangepast moet worden ik ga dan aan het werk met de tekst en melodie dan moet er niet te veel meer aan gesleuteld worden ik houd van muziek die rauw en een beetje fucked up is soms leveren fouten vondsten op die je niet kan reproduceren
6357866 albini begon wel heel afstandelijk maar toen de sessie liep werd hij wat relaxter en was hij best bereid zijn mening te geven over de songs en wat er anders en beter kon als wij het hem vroegen maar andrew schneider heeft op the ruiner ook heel veel goede idee n ingebracht en een fantastisch geluid neergezet we kenden hem al heel goed hij is een vriend en zijn persoonlijkheid past echt bij die van ons
6357867 dat maakt het wel moeilijk want ik was gewend helemaal los te gaan nu moet ik er meer bijblijven maar het maakt de liveshow beter en ook interessanter zo word ik de oude nummers ook niet zat
6357868 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

6357870 de drie coalitiepartijen partij van de arbeid christenunie en cda met zn drie n hebben vanavond besloten dat hij voor de tijd dat wethouder engelvaart nog ziek is wij een vervanger gaan zoeken
6357871 vooruitlopend op dit voorstel van het college van burgemeester en wethouders heeft de pvda fractie de coalitiepartner cda de ruimte gegeven om op zoek te gaan naar een geschikte kandidaat voor het geval dat de raad positief besluit op het voorstel van het college van burgemeester en wethouders tot vervanging van hans engelvaart

6357954 so does this matt have a last name do we know him
6357955 yeah its a long story but short version is that hes convinced me to give him a chance and kathy relinquished her rights to him last night so i havent gone backstabber or anything im just trying him out

6357977 after our hopes were dashed more than forty years ago one of our desires has come to fruition
6357978 we need to be a lot more competitive on the offensive side of the ball we need to have a better football acumen we need to be more consistent
6357979 as for defense the defense is playing fast playing well at times but giving up way too many big plays we need to get our defense to the point they are not getting the ball thrown over their heads
6357980 we havent had players stand out yet on the outside receivers in fact we stink so in my opinion those spots are wide open for somebody to emerge
6357981 we have to replace three very good ones but its clear we have talent there and its just a matter of time weve been dirt average on defensive line we need to find a few guys there
6357982 im ready to go as soon as the coaches want to let me
6357983 hes looked great and hes going to play a lot of football for us
6357984 he just makes us better we will have a lot of offensive weapons just like last year
6357985 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6357986 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6357987 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6357988 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade
6357989 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6357990 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6357991 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6357992 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6357993 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas
6357994 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome
6357995 the security rules and principles that are used are the same security principles that are used when anyone applies for a visa
6357996 im still trying to unpick the differences between his position that the scheme should be abolished his small business spokesperson said the scheme should be expanded his foreign affairs spokesman who is cautious but not negative about the scheme and any member of the national party who seems willing to speak who is wildly enthusiastic about the scheme
6357997 whether brendan nelson is putting forward a position on behalf of the opposition or not ive given up trying to work that out
6357998 its not been raised with me in meetings with ministers
6357999 thats not to say that there might not be interest here but i think people have recognised the comments which we have made that government is starting with a pilot and we are starting in a modest fashion

6358001 its illegal to download pedophile material so i think theres some scope for creative legislation here al manar recruits terrorists and effectively advertises for donations
6358002 acma is analysing current broadcasts by al manar and will report to government on whether any of its broadcasts offend the counter terrorism standards
6358003 the government will await the report by acma before determining any further action
6358004 in this respect it appears to have breached the relevant broadcasting code of practice in inciting racial hatred

6358007 permasalahan minyak ini harus dibahas dari sisi hulu sampai hilir selain dpr benar benar menanyakan perdagangan juga melihat potret produksi minyak di negara kita penurunan minyak mentah setiap tahunnya wajib dipertanyakan
6358008 selain kebijakan pemerintah untuk menaikan harga bbm dpr juga akan menanyakan produksi minyak mentah nasional dan kinerja para pembantu presiden
6358009 kenapa pengadaannya menjadi tidak efisien sehingga negara harus membayar mahal untuk pengadaan tersebut dibandingkan dengan negara lain
6358010 defisit apbn kita saat ini mencapai rp 91 triliun sedangkan pengurang subsidi bbm hanya bisa menambal defisit tersebut rp 10 triliun angka tersebut masih sangat jauh
6358011 banyak jalan untuk menambal defisit apbn ini sehingga tidak menyusahkan rakyat
6358012 saya rasa impeach ini lebih kepada para menteri yang memberikan masukan kepada presiden
6358013 tidak mungkin usulan bappenas dilaksanakan untuk menaikkan harga bbm secara bertahap hingga mengikuti harga pasar terlebih lagi tingginya resistensi masyarakat terhadap kenaikan harga bbm saat ini terlalu besar risikonya siapa pun presidennya pasti akan jatuh
6358014 karena itu tidak ada alasan pemerintah melepaskan harga bbm sesuai harga pasar hal tersebut berbeda dengan harga minyak dunia

6358027 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6358028 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6358029 theyre a wonderful wonderful wonderful side it will be a tough ask but well go down there and give it our best shot
6358030 were in pretty good form we have been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6358031 but going down to a hostile environment like that weve had some good wins down there in the last few years but weve come off a couple of hidings against geelong so we need to make sure were at our best
6358032 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry its a wonderful learning curve particularly for our younger guys that we go down there play the way we want to play and do the very best we can
6358033 certainly our footy club is not in a position to play ducks and drakes or resting players whereas the cats are probably in a bit of a different position
6358034 theyve got three or four that have been out do they play them or do they give them an extra week to make sure theyre right
6358035 i think thats the next step for us to be able to live in this environment and still perform
6358036 their journey has been amazing some of these guys have got to travel four hours through three check points just to get to one hours training
6358037 we know that sports can overcome the barriers of religion gender and also of conflicted areas such as ours
6358038 we are familiar with the afl only for the last year or so we learn this totally new game and we met totally new stars and celebrities such as dipper
6358039 they have a lot of agile small players with real pace
6358040 its a matter of using our strengths to our advantage and making sure we try to limit theirs
6358041 theres definitely an element of not allowing them just to walk out of stoppages weve got to keep a lot of pressure on them there
6358042 weve worked really hard on our stoppage set ups and weve seen some improvement there but in terms of the stoppages themselves obviously you are trying to win them but if you lose them you are trying to make them as pressured as possible
6358043 that was one of the areas where they really cut us up last time
6358044 hell be a little bit nervous which is good because it brings some freshness some new enthusiasm to the side and obviously we all know when des gets the ball in his hands hes very valuable

6358064 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack

6358067 it has certainly got everyone talking and it is nice that it has put the town on the map
6358068 it is not nice for the people who cant sleep but for everyone else it is like a treasure hunt or a whodunnit a lot of people are very inquisitive about what has caused it
6358069 the rumours include a spaceship and electricity pylons while we even had one woman suggest the noise was similar to the one made by insects when she was holidaying in malta
6358070 another man living in minneapolis emailed and said it sounded like it could be air conditioning the general consensus is that it is something industrial
6358071 i had my suspicions but now other people in the town have noticed it i am completely thrown i just hope we can locate the noise as soon as possible and the council can do something as it is getting annoying
6358072 we have received no complaints so we cannot pursue it any further we have asked the community warden and others to be more precise about the possible location suffolk homes
6358073 i was told years ago by a doctor that my condition was going to end up with renal failure
6358074 for the past couple of years when i have been getting blood test results i somehow thought that that is just what they say and it would not happen to me but about five months ago a doctor told me that i was going to have to go on dialysis soon
6358075 kidney donation in particular is considered a very easy surgery
6358076 it is the type of thing that if it was going to affect anybody negatively i would not be asking
6358077 obviously if somebody donated it would benefit me but i also think it would benefit the donor i would really hope it would create some kind of connection between us and also make the person feel really good about themselves i think it would be really nice for the right person
6358078 from my point of view i would be at a loss for gratitude
6358079 knowing that you have done such a wonderful and altruistic thing as save somebodys life must be a great feeling
6358080 it is really true that having something like this makes you feel so much more appreciative of everything and i am a really happy person in general i can say that i am in a much better frame of mind than i was before it really does make you feel so extraordinary thankful for everything
6358081 sse has long argued for a break up of baa and is therefore delighted by the provisional findings report from the competition commission concluding that baa must sell two of its three london airports
6358082 we consider it inconceivable that baa would willingly sell heathrow which means that stansted and gatwick must both be sold
6358083 this will not in itself remove the threat of a second runway at stansted but we believe it moves us a step closer to the day when this idea will be abandoned
6358084 we wont be distracted by the issue of ownership and we will continue to make the case that building another runway in this rural location would be an environmental calamity
6358085 the commissions findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
6358086 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying that delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
6358087 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
6358088 absolutely we were last in the world in kickoff returns were emphasizing that

6358102 non il modo in cui io intendo il comportamento di un campione sono le parole di rogge non ho nessun problema quando fa il suo show per credo che debba dimostrare maggior rispetto per i suoi avversari dovrebbe stringere le mani dare pacche sulle spalle agli altri atleti e non mettersi a fare quei gesti come ha fatto dopo i 100 metri capisco la gioia la felicit avrebbe per potuto esprimerla in un altro modo invece sembrava quasi dire prendetemi se ci riuscite queste cose non si fanno ma bolt imparer ancora giovane
6358103 deve essere considerato oggi prosegue rogge come lo fu jesse owens negli anni trenta solo che lui vince con distacchi maggiori certo owens faceva anche il lungo e quindi non si pu fare un paragone per se continua cos bolt destinato a lasciare un segno nella storia come fece owens nella velocit in unaltra dimensione

6358120 we do not use excessive force that is a waste of resources we are using appropriate response to the threat that is confronting our troops
6358121 what we are doing is supporting our pnp in law enforcement there is no truth to the statement that we are using excessive response that is a waste of resources on the part of the armed forces and we will not do that

6358127 we wanted him to finish school but god wanted him to be a boxer
6358128 in mechanics class we dealt with heavy engines and we would see who could carry the engines by themselves we would also test the engine heat with our bare hands and say to each other if youre strong put your hands in there samuel would always do these things
6358129 people believe that boxing is a way to gain because of samuel peter people know this is another avenue to succeed in life
6358130 i used to get in a lot of fights as a kid i had to find a way out a way forward in life

6358132 ive been working on the need for this program for more than a decade
6358133 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6358134 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6358135 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6358136 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6358137 quite obviously in certain areas in regional australia there is a strong requirement for labour that you cant get from other areas
6358138 there are certain jobs that you just cant get employees to do and if that leaves fruit rotting or abattoirs not working then thats not a good outcome

6358140 im still trying to unpick the differences between his position that the scheme should be abolished his small business spokesperson said the scheme should be expanded his foreign affairs spokesman who is cautious but not negative about the scheme and any member of the national party who seems willing to speak who is wildly enthusiastic about the scheme

6358152 we know that sports can overcome the barriers of religion gender and also of conflicted areas such as ours
6358153 we are familiar with the afl only for the last year or so
6358154 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
6358155 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint

6358159 nacer is young but has played in their first team and he will come here to join up with our first team squad
6358160 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6358161 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6358162 theyre a wonderful wonderful wonderful side it will be a tough ask but well go down there and give it our best shot
6358163 were in pretty good form we have been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6358164 but going down to a hostile environment like that weve had some good wins down there in the last few years but weve come off a couple of hidings against geelong so we need to make sure were at our best
6358165 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry its a wonderful learning curve particularly for our younger guys that we go down there play the way we want to play and do the very best we can
6358166 certainly our footy club is not in a position to play ducks and drakes or resting players whereas the cats are probably in a bit of a different position
6358167 theyve got three or four that have been out do they play them or do they give them an extra week to make sure theyre right

6358175 they have a lot of agile small players with real pace
6358176 its a matter of using our strengths to our advantage and making sure we try to limit theirs
6358177 theres definitely an element of not allowing them just to walk out of stoppages weve got to keep a lot of pressure on them there
6358178 weve worked really hard on our stoppage set ups and weve seen some improvement there but in terms of the stoppages themselves obviously you are trying to win them but if you lose them you are trying to make them as pressured as possible
6358179 that was one of the areas where they really cut us up last time
6358180 hell be a little bit nervous which is good because it brings some freshness some new enthusiasm to the side and obviously we all know when des gets the ball in his hands hes very valuable
6358181 at a meeting of the emergency commission on dealing with the consequences of georgias act of aggression it was announced that 1 492 people were killed in georgias attack on south ossetia
6358182 whenever theres a corrupt system then youre going to have these birds of prey descend on it to get their share of the spoils
6358183 let me just begin by saying that to save you some time im not going to comment on the vice president
6358184 i point out what my record is which is one that has not won me miss congeniality over the years
6358185 people want change in america we all know that and very legitimately so
6358186 i would not allow anyone who worked for my administration to go back to lobbying
6358187 i have and continue to question his judgment whether it be his initial reaction to the russian invasion of georgia or whether it be his failure to acknowledge that the surge has succeeded or his opposition to nuclear power among others
6358188 so i question the judgment i dont question the patriotism
6358189 it would be important to have some kind of framework for the meeting in other words there would have to be some kind of predetermined at least outcome about some aspects of the meeting for example some progress in some area that was agreed upon earlier the reagan gorbachev et cetera it would have to be something besides just a quote meeting
6358190 some people are wealthy and rich in their lives and their children and their ability to educate them others are poor if theyre billionaires
6358191 but the fact is that they are the symptom of a disease
6358192 as long as you have earmarking and pork barrel spending and
6358193 so its kind of entertaining to me to attack the lobbyists rather than the source of the problem which is the earmark theyd all be out of business most of em would be out of business if we stopped pork barrel and earmark spending
6358194 as you know i have condemned the commercials invoking obama pastor the that were done by various people
6358195 my dad left us and now he took my mama away i was mad but later on it dawned on me god just wanted me to learn its just that he taught me a lesson the hard way
6358196 its not a farce but there are farcical elements to it
6358197 it has a very similar sense of humor to those two films its definitely an unusual sense of humor shanley writes really delightful funny ways of people speaking their minds
6358198 the title on the one hand is unfortunate because it sounds like something disturbed and disturbing but on the other hand when you see the play you realize its the perfect title
6358199 it really is a delightful comedy very witty its so buoyant and joyful and adorable
6358200 we have to get past the name to find an audience
6358201 its about a guy who has this secret and dont we all about his sex life
6358202 he tells his best friend his secret in hopes of getting some help and one secret leads to another its really about how does love last if we knew the truth about everybody wed never even try
6358203 the meat of the play is just really beautiful stuff one of the big ideas in the play is that everybody has something youre not going to like why keep moving on and on why not just accept that about that person and just stick it out
6358204 you have the play you have the words then you pick the people
6358205 the ukraine is a reliable business partner we will honour all obligations under existing treaties

6358212 when we decided to do this event a primary reason was that we wanted to make the hands on learning that we do at the museum available to a broad range of the community that might not choose to come to the museum
6358213 it was a way for us to demonstrate what we do
6358214 its a struggle for us to stay open actually because the event requires all of our staff down at the plaza
6358215 the staff tells us that its not uncommon for visitors to say they got excited about something at sand in the city and came to the museum
6358216 weve been getting e mails from people from different states saying they are planning their visit to coincide with the event
6358217 people want to make sure they have the right dates and they want to know what else is happening in the community a family like that definitely will want to take in the museum in addition to the event
6358218 so it will be fun for them to have even more to look at
6358219 weve given them the design of the new childrens museum and theyre going to create their version of that in sand
6358220 were going to have a booth that has an activity for children to create ideas
6358221 were doing drawings and we might do clay sculptures with modeling clay
6358222 one of the areas weve been researching is the connection between the native americans of the pacific northwest and the water so in the global village we are doing native american art

6358401 the regulation has been drafted and is ready to present to the governor
6358402 this means that starting 1 september buying and selling in ivory products in namibia will be prohibited for the duration of the moratorium
6358403 the ministry want to establish a legal trade in omakipas carved from ivory supp lied by the ministry to strengthen control measures within namibia
6358404 the traders are not registered and that is the reason we want to have them operating under a legal framework

6358408 it is the first time that the ioc has taken the decision to turn to justice over unsporting and illegal behavior
6358409 there are specific reasons that have led to this action since the substance is really deadly and there is a large number of athletes that have been caught using it
6358410 the file that we have submitted has to do with halkia in the iocs decision the name of her coach is also mentioned we will see how the suit is drawn up

6358416 on behalf of the government the people of kenya and on my own behalf l extend our heartfelt condolences to you personally and through you to the bereaved family the government and people of zambia
6358417 during the struggle for plural politics in zambia the late mwanawasa played a pivotal role and was not only a source of inspiration and encouragement to the people but he also displayed tremendous powers of the application of the rule of law
6358418 prior to his election as president the late mwanawasa already had a distinguished career in public service including serving as vice president of zambia during the tenure of former president fredrick chiluba
6358419 his struggle for justice and economic well being of his people will be an enduring chapter in the history of zambia the greatest honor we can bestow to his departed soul is to build on the moral social and political foundation he built
6358420 these activities are carried out at weekends when our service is closed so it is up to the police who have nevertheless made some arrests and imposed fines

6358423 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency
6358424 as such there is need for a universal moratorium on all incomes and prices for a minimum period of six months
6358425 its not to the benefit of anyone to have cases pending for two to three years
6358426 due to the fact that the life of the asylum applicant is at stake the examination of an asylum application is a time consuming procedure
6358427 this factor together with the big number of asylum applications pending needs to be taken into consideration in deciding how many more eligibility officers should be recruited for this highly responsible task
6358428 we try to improve the system but we cannot afford the financial and administrative pressure without the help and the assistance of the european union

6358432 it is not easy but it is better here than in the city
6358433 here we have food at every meal and the hospital is near
6358434 a lot of migrants came for economic reasons and are told by traffickers to submit an application for asylum in order to prolong their stay or stay permanently
6358435 the majority of illegal immigrants or asylum seekers who come here enter from the turkish zone and turkey should be made responsible

6358442 those safeties are going to have to play older than they are
6358443 weve got more quality guys at the kicker and punter positions since weve been here
6358444 you have to be fair and try to separate i dont know we probably ought to put the same number on all of them and just rotate them
6358445 yall didnt hear that did you that was funny if you missed it lets do it again what were going to do is put the same number on all of them
6358446 hes really working out because hes 295 pounds and he can move his feet
6358447 some of them were in middle school when i was a high school senior
6358448 i cant believe how many young guys weve got running around here but we need them because we dont have a lot of returning experience
6358449 we mentioned earlier that we have to have some of the young receivers come on
6358450 im really pleased with malcolm williams hes having a heck of a camp it goes without saying that quan and jordan are doing well but malcolm is doing really well dan buckner has had a very productive camp and james kirkendoll has done the same
6358451 you never know how theyre going to play when they get out in front of 98 000 people
6358452 we have our scrimmages in the stadium and everything and i catch them looking around and just wondering
6358453 we make our comments and get them ready for it i think theyre going to do fine theyre playmakers and theyre ready
6358454 we really dont know we havent played a game yet
6358455 we have a lot of guys that are making plays for us showing up and getting better the coaches will decide who plays and when they do im confident in whoever they pick
6358456 at the last moment when we were tied 2 2 i told myself i should hold until the last minute and i won
6358457 the political will exists to achieve this by using all institutional means
6358458 we are determined to put an end to situations and practices that do not do honor to the greek market no one is above the law
6358459 we were expecting more they were better what can we say in the crucial moments when we had to score we didnt at the beginning they made the big gap and it was hard to get equal with them
6358460 the attorney general robert mcclelland needs to look at some of the loose ends implicit in this case mr rubenstein said
6358461 its illegal to download pedophile material so i think theres some scope for creative legislation here al manar recruits terrorists and effectively advertises for donations
6358462 acma is analysing current broadcasts by al manar and will report to government on whether any of its broadcasts offend the counter terrorism standards senator conroy said
6358463 the government will await the report by acma before determining any further action he said
6358464 al manar is renowned for inciting violence and hatred the commission said in a statement
6358465 in this respect it appears to have breached the relevant broadcasting code of practice in inciting racial hatred
6358466 i dont know why it had not been found earlier it may have been snagged it may have been underwater for a period of time and recent rains just brought it to the surface sgt rodgers said today
6358467 its a very sad ending unfortunately hes been missing for two weeks so it was an ending that was probably to be expected
6358468 it looked like a dummy but i touched his ear it felt soft and not hard like a dummy so i knew he told reporters today adding mr denson and he were upset by the find
6358469 its not very nice not when youve got kids of your own
6358470 i just hope that it was an accident and he fell in and no rats killed him
6358471 at least now hes been found they can do something about it and start living now they have got the boy back
6358472 theyre students obviously very upset were watching them mr campbell said
6358473 the worst has happened but in a way they were prepared for the worst
6358474 he was a lovely happy cheerful kid his english wasnt fantastic but he was going to the language school in melbourne
6358475 he was a very energetic little guy always all over the place why are we doing this when are we doing this what are we doing next
6358476 naughty isnt a word that i would use he was playful inventive
6358477 pool rat running around sneaking up behind people stealing their snacks and goggles tapping them on the shoulder and running away and just causing general havoc
6358478 in my middle fingers i liked to twirl pens and pencils but if they werent available at dinner i might try to substitute a salt shaker or steak knife i should have known i couldnt twirl glasses of milk
6358479 you find children who have adhd are very creative individuals very determined and they can focus they can focus very intently on something that they love
6358480 it is very important to be able to allow your child to experience all sorts of things to be able to focus on what they enjoy and what they have a passion for
6358481 he is quite relaxed in fact i get more worked up
6358482 i feel he is definitely settled and if there is hyperactivity he is able to handle it very calmly

6358486 the snp has a strong social conscience which is very scottish in itself
6358487 one of the reasons scotland didnt take to lady thatcher was because of that we didnt mind the economic side so much but we didnt like the social side at all
6358488 the tories have been more constructive than other opposition parties in the scottish parliament but i dont think you have to scratch very hard to see real anti scottish antagonism from many elements of the conservative party i dont think the leopard has changed its spots
6358489 he didnt really approve of me setting foot in the house of commons it was a hell of a moment
6358490 its very difficult to be calm in a room with a bloody big notice that says
6358491 when youre first minister you probably dont find it wise to own up to mistake after mistake
6358492 you wouldnt expect us to be bosom buddies walking arm in arm to the pub for a wee snifter
6358493 i believe in independence for scotland clearly the prime minister doesnt no amount of rapprochement will bring us together on that issue and that applies to a range of other issues too
6358494 which is an even bigger problem than it is in england
6358495 this is difficult because we are tilting against vested interests the power of which you would not believe
6358496 nobody has accused me of wanting to get rid of her i have said nothing about her troubles this idea that i was chasing and harrying her i must be the most restrained politician of all time
6358497 it proves that even after such an illness you can win gold
6358498 i think he should show more respect shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones not making gestures like the one he made

6358520 modest the bca suggests returning emissions to 2000 levels by 2020
6358521 as the government we have to be very conscious that any decision to shield one sector or increase the protection to one sector will inevitably place greater costs on other parts of the community and other parts of the economy senator wong said
6358522 the emissions trading scheme must do whats right for the climate and for all australians not whats good for a few big polluters seeking a golden handshake mr henry said
6358523 there appears to be a growing chorus of big carbon emitters calling for weak carbon targets and special treatment as part of the governments response to climate change he said
6358524 it may only be 14 companies in the data but i think you can take it pretty clearly that the way those 14 companies react would be pretty typical of the industry sectors he said

6358628 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6358629 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6358630 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic

6358651 my personal dream came true late last year when a group led by roger kornberg at stanford university made a breakthrough experiment determining the atomic structure of gold nanoparticles of a certain size the structure resembled the prediction our research group had already earlier published in the recent study we were able to comprehend why nature generates exactly these kinds of particles the size of one particle is 1 3 nanometers and since they behave in many respects like giant atoms we call them superatoms in our study
6358652 our study would not have been possible without the extensive high performance computing resources of the national it centres of finland germany and sweden the study took up quite a lot of computation time but it was well worth the effort i believe that our theoretical model on the stability of the gold nanoparticles will prove itself very useful in many interdisciplinary fields of research

6358674 in order to attain the goals of the ikb rescue mission kfw took on an extraordinarily heavy burden but one that is not too heavy to handle we remain on solid financial footing what is important is that we have now closed the chapter on ikbs rescue we do not face any more unforeseeable risks with regard to ikb we can now go back to concentrating fully on our work as a promotional bank

6358681 this has been a very successful bit of water for us over the last two weeks its time for me to do my part
6358682 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts tomorrow the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6358683 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6358684 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives
6358685 the amateur boxing association aba choosing to yesterday wednesday issue billy joe saunders with a suspension relating to an incident which happened months before the beijing olympic games is extremely disappointing
6358686 releasing such allegations to the media at this time could prove detrimental to the critical preparations of the other three boxers who will be contesting to reach the final of the boxing competition tomorrow
6358687 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6358688 over the past four years i have put together a boxing programme which has produced the best ever commonwealth games results three world championship medallists the most qualifiers for the olympic games since 1992 and the most olympic medal winners since 1972
6358689 but more importantly i have tried to instil in my team a respect for themselves and others and a sense of pride in competing for their country i will thoroughly address all allegations made when i get back to the uk
6358690 right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6358691 at this critical time for us our focus is on the performances in beijing and the three boxers who have already won medals for their country exceeding everyones expectations and the sports own medal target
6358692 i would never die for my beliefs because i might be wrong
6358693 revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most
6358694 we were elated with the success of our first big bingo bash and are already looking at dates to host the event again next year
6358695 call the park ahead of time as the wind conditions are a major factor in the number of flyers who will be here
6358696 this is the best time of the year for hang gliding the drier and the hotter it is the higher the clouds are
6358697 if its been dry the cloud bank is high and the lift is strong we typically fly from mount nebo to mount magazine and back
6358698 the mortality rate for hang gliding was very high back then
6358699 pilots were using bamboo and visqueen to build a glide the gliders have progressed in design and safety like race cars and the training programs have also improved the accident rate has also gone down
6358700 more than 50 people from all over the world started flying competitively aug 2 our gps downloads result in a track log at the end of the day you turn in the gps which downloads the logs and thats where we get the results
6358701 the rigid wing craft is the same size area wise but 160 square feet creates a lot more lift
6358702 its a passion of mine once you run off the mountain youre totally committed its a lot like surfing except you look for thermal winds instead of waves of water
6358703 ive had some great experiences especially when you get a low save it doesnt happen often but its when youre down to 200 400 feet off the ground and you get into a holding pattern you hope to catch something so you keepworking it you climb 400 500 feet and pretty soon youre up in the clouds
6358704 once you get your basic skills down you have to continue to practice those skills
6358705 the thing that makes hang gliding dangerous is getting in over your head in peak conditions
6358706 hang gliders can even break up up in mid air those rough winds are whiteknuckle stuff
6358707 we want to make sure the newer pilots understand the vision of the more experienced pilots hang gliding is really hard work to get your flying time in as no one wants to go to the crummy sites to practice
6358708 i had been flying at petit jean and short mountain in paris arkansas and another sitethats in the jasper area thats for hang 2 pilots
6358709 you have to have 10 hours of air time to progress to the level of a hang 3
6358710 girls didnt want to hang out with me and climb trees go camping and ride four wheelers ive always taught group fitness my first job at the age of 16 was leading exercise classes
6358711 i cant say that one course leadme to the other but when im up in the air getting bumped around my yoga practice helps me ride the wave get centered and focused and to breathe
6358712 two years ago i was at the barn feeding the horses and john drove up he said he was a hang gliding pilot and wanted to know about buying some property
6358713 im really looking forward to the flyin when youre up there its all about you and when you land you feel invincible
6358714 people come in from other states like tennessee and sometimes we get people from farther away one year we had a guy from france
6358715 even if the weather is bad the group will get together and cook out we dont always know how far were going to go but we can put it down almost anywhere
6358716 my favorite part of the first day of school is visiting the classrooms after we get started to meet the students
6358717 my biggest challenge is getting familiar with the differences between public education and private and parochial education for example the finances are different because we have to raise all the money we spend thats one of the big differences
6358718 my high school math teacher earl parks inspired me to become a teacher he had worked for the highway department too and he just didnt teach math out of the book he explained to us how we would usemath in our jobs
6358719 the best part of being aneducator is just having the opportunity to work with kids in their educational pursuits as well as in their personal lives as a mentor
6358720 i think the big difference in school between now and when i was in school is it was rare to find a student who didnt live with both biological parents now it is rare to find a student who does live with both biological parents
6358721 we always had the desire to work with troubled young people it was tough but rewarding
6358722 i think of my 36 years of education experience like a fourlayer cake beebe greenbrier shirley and rose bud the opportunity here really is the icing on the cake
6358723 its a great day to take care of you come early and sign up for a massage a manicure and a pedicure
6358724 the show is always fun and you get to see the latest styles
6358725 they tell you where the outfit is from as well as what it would cost to purchase it there
6358726 this unique jewelry has been fashioned from broken china when you break a piece of china you cant often use it anymore but in its new form these broken pieces are beautiful and have a new purpose just like the women we serve
6358727 this is a heavily discounted rate for services that would normally cost a lot more
6358728 this was happening around the time of the o j simpson case when i started with all this i did not realize how huge the problem of domestic violence was or the roots of it
6358729 eighty to 85 percent of our rape clients are college students as colleges have a large population of people who see each other often there are fewer inhibitions about hanging out with other people remember a rape is usually done by a casual acquaintance
6358730 in the last decade arkansas has been ranked ninth nationally for domestic homicides per capita and first in the number of deaths of african americanwomen in 2002
6358731 there are about 38 shelters serving 75 counties in arkansas charitable contributions are down and these shelters struggle to provide services
6358732 this event provides a fun and productive way to become more aware of domestic violence and raise funds to meet the needs of the shelter since 2003 we have raised over 65 000 with 100 percent of the proceeds put back into the shelter
6358733 our hotline 1 866 358 2265 is answered 24 hours a day sometimes we get calls from someone that thinks there is domestic violence in a relationship or they call and say that they want to leave their spouse but dont know how to do it a lot of people may not realize that most victims are killed in the process of leaving
6358734 i was in a relationship for four years and had two children by my abuser
6358735 these women are our friends our mothers our sisters our co workers and our neighbors they dont talk about it because of the reaction that they get
6358736 a lot of times they need help with getting a job and with transportation so they can get on their feet
6358737 we are excited and proud for kimberly to receive this opportunity

6358740 while cyber shopping visits rose most quickly in germany during the first week of the holiday shopping season online shoppers in france have since become more active
6358741 these gains show that consumers armed with high speed access and positive online retail experiences are increasingly comfortable shopping online
6358742 as online spending continues to grow and account for a larger percentage of total consumer spending the growth in online shopping could be the difference between a good christmas and a great christmas for many online retailers

6358747 essendon is decimated i suppose but i can guarantee that essendon will put out 22 players on the field and theyll be having a red hot go
6358748 we do need to win we would probably go into the game as favourites but were going to go into it with an underdog attitude
6358749 weve got the confidence in our players and we think with just a few minor tweaks and adjustments in their attitude we can get the results we had earlier in the year
6358750 tommy wont play this week hell play the following week barring any setbacks
6358751 hell be out there next week and weve got our fingers crossed that hell be well

6358754 it wouldve been a bonus if jason was available because of the quality player he is but we havent had him the last couple of weeks
6358755 with the type of football were playing at the moment it would be good to have a player like that but weve been managing without him
6358756 i heard about that yesterday but im under contract for the next couple of years so yeah thats all i can say to it
6358757 they have a lot of agile small players with real pace
6358758 its a matter of using our strengths to our advantage and making sure we try to limit theirs
6358759 theres definitely an element of not allowing them just to walk out of stoppages weve got to keep a lot of pressure on them there
6358760 weve worked really hard on our stoppage set ups and weve seen some improvement there but in terms of the stoppages themselves obviously you are trying to win them but if you lose them you are trying to make them as pressured as possible
6358761 that was one of the areas where they really cut us up last time
6358762 hell be a little bit nervous which is good because it brings some freshness some new enthusiasm to the side and obviously we all know when des gets the ball in his hands hes very valuable
6358763 for the senior guys and the young guys to experience the hype of still being in the hunt at this time of year is fantastic
6358764 theres a great vibrancy around the club all weve got to do is win these last two games and hope some results go our way
6358765 we played really well against them early on in the year but theyve improved in terms of contested ball possession and clearance work which is what were good at so that will be a good challenge
6358766 i still think theyre a quality side i dont think where they are on the ladder is really what theyre capable of
6358767 theyve got some good players and i think their second half of the year theyve been in games where theyve only lost by a couple of kicks or that sort of thing
6358768 i love big challenges were both two totally different players hes got the height and i try to use my speed and agility around the ground
6358769 dons comments at the time raised questions and we sought clarification as to what he meant by unfair after the hearing
6358770 he said he regretted the choice of words and as much as he may disagree with the decision he did not intend any suggestion of bias or lack of procedure by the panel the judiciary chairman or the judiciary staff
6358771 he has apologised if that suggestion has been taken and his apology has been forwarded to the judiciary
6358772 their role is to be as consistent as they possibly can and i know they spend hours and hours each week reviewing incidents and comparing them to previous incidents to try and ensure that they are consistent
6358773 but the fact is each case has its own particular features and no two cases are ever completely alike and then it becomes a matter of judgement
6358774 but you always draw the line at any suggestion theyre being less than professional and honest in the way they carry out their duties
6358775 losing vickerman elsom and lyons is a really really big hole in that waratah forward pack let alone the waratah team
6358776 thats something that really we need to focus on and its an opportunity for other guys to step up so thats a challenge
6358777 the waratahs do need to replace those guys and theres a fine line there youll have some good young talent and its whether or not theyre ready
6358778 the relaxation of being able to look at some other players overseas certainly gives you that option of bringing in maybe some seniority which ushers through the junior guys
6358779 what i saw from slightly arms length but i did spend a bit of time with the tahs this year was a pretty good values system if you like within the team
6358780 theres no substituting that experience but at the same time i think what you will have is younger guys stepping into a group that has a history of the right sort of mentality going into seasons and thats going to be helpful
6358781 i dont think you ever leave a job feeling like its all done youre always looking at whats next and how to improve
6358782 i was offered the job initially for two years to the world cup and i said look what im seeing its going to take three years for discernible change
6358783 on finishing the job my attitude is from now to the end of the year theres still a lot of improvement to be sought and gained but you walk away saying what ive promised ive hopefully delivered
6358784 well look at from the other side my mom has all of my great grandmothers stuff which included alot of pieces from the depression era and then there is all of the stuff my grandmother has which includes all of the stuff from my great aunt
6358785 most of the new stuff i have bought fit better with my life style yes i use the set of china from my grandmother for holidays but its not dishwasher safe wont go in the microwave and has gold flake on it that really is not practical for everyday use unlike the modern have plates i use today that can survive a minor fall to the carpet and who wants to always be handwashing things and worrying they will break
6358786 so people if you love your collections of stuff try to give your things before you die or thru your will to people who will appreciate them your kids or grandkids may just toss your dearest possessions in the nearest dumpster
6358787 we dont like talking about the center line it overly emphasizes where the storm is likely to go

6358794 in china human rabies was largely under control during the years 1990 1996 via nation wide rabies vaccination programmes since the end of the century however cases of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for control and prevention
6358795 the use of human and equine rabies immunoglobulins hrig erig has saved the lives of countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone however both products are often in short supply worldwide and are virtually unaffordable in developing countries
6358796 the four rabies endemic provinces lacked strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans
6358797 in the worst affected province guandong 62 5 of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds 92 5 did not receive adequate post exposure vaccination and 91 25 did not receive any anti rabies immunoglobulin

6358819 the reason why google and yahoo are the most used sites online is because people are hunting and gathering to find the topics that match their myriad and individual specific interests and those billions of people are gravitating away from generic analog products that deliver the same mix of news to everyone theyre moving away from the analog newspaper

6358860 it was only encouraging people to fight against each other
6358861 i asked them for what and they told me that it was for questioning and so i told them that i had to inform my superiors at work and then i would come
6358862 they said i had the same locks height and description of the person that they were looking for and even though i insisted they told me i am now in custody and i have to go into the lock ups
6358863 when i reached there i heard murmuring that this was not the man one officer looked at me and say i was not the person
6358864 even though i understand that they had a right to question me i believe they were not professional
6358865 but they kept insisting i was never married it was very embarrassing for me and my family and i feel this has stained my life and i want an apology
6358866 but i feel that the police needed to act better than that do proper investigations be clear about it and not put people through this for nothing
6358867 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6358868 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6358869 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important

6358932 context specific national preventive strategies not off the shelf slogans dreamt up by donors religious fundamentalists moralists and wishful thinkers who craft prevention policies based on the assumptions that adolescents are not sexually active and if they are that they can be persuaded to practise abstinence without failure until marriage and that marriage is a protective factor against hiv infections
6358933 responsible for the fact that around 2 5 million people become newly infected with hiv each year
6358934 when one looks at the politics of this pandemic one immediately discovers a litany of declarations and commitments leaders forums and high level consultations
6358935 and to be precise no single prevention strategy will be sufficient we need combined prevention and we need to rethink our approach to evaluating prevention and honestly address what works and what does not work

6358963 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6358964 its the closest to hell that ive seen the bodies were boiling hot we burnt ourselves collecting them
6358965 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6358966 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that

6358972 the lesson of this experience is in this war we must use all assets of national power to keep the pressure on the enemy keep the terrorists on the run and keep the american people safe from harm
6358973 americas future leaders must always remember that the war on terror will be won on the offense and that is where americas military must stay

6358975 and these tools will be available for future administrations to protect the american people for years to come

6358990 if i did not have the confidence in the ecb on the way they have handled the smooth running off of this competition i would not have been sponsoring this tournament for so long i must say thanks to mr johnson and his executives for the efficient way in which they have run off the competition over the past five years
6358991 i am happy to know that more teams will be involved in this years competition which will give many persons the opportunity to see some cricket whilst at the same time show to the people that we at guyana beverages company are giving back to the community in a tangible way
6358992 gbc will continue to partner with the ecb and to this effect we will be pumping over 1 5m into next years tournament and even if i am not around my hardworking marketing executive will ensure that my promise made here today is fulfilled we will always continue to support essequibo when they are down and when they are up as they have continued to support us without failure

6359036 the large sized lcd panel market has been mired in a state of severe oversupply since the start of june due to lower than expected panel demand and high inventory levels throughout the supply chain
6359037 conditions have worsened in august with poor economic circumstances causing prices to decline at an even faster pace than before however panel production cuts combined with the clearance of inventory and a recovery in demand from tvs desktop pc monitors and notebook pcs are expected to shift the supply demand equation back to balance in september this will lead to a recovery in pricing
6359038 reacting to weak sales and declining profitability panel suppliers began to slash their utilization rates starting in july
6359039 lcd tv and desktop pc monitor manufacturers also are starting to cut their prices in order to reduce inventories and boost end user demand these developments along with recovering demand from the notebook segment will bring stabilization to large sized lcd panel pricing in september some panel prices may even increase by 1 to 3 especially those which are reaching at or below the cost levels

6359410 in a 2007 survey of california voters 84 percent said they thought the government should force restaurant chains to display calorie numbers on their menus and menu boards that may happen soon the state assembly is considering a bill already approved by the state senate that would make california the first state to impose such a menu mandate yet the desires that people express in polls are often at odds with the preferences they reveal in the marketplace the restaurant business is highly competitive if customers really were clamoring for conspicuous calorie counts restaurants would provide them voluntarily a legal requirement is necessary not because consumers want impossible to ignore nutritional information but because by and large they dont
6359411 a major theme of john mccains campaign is that he has far more experience in foreign affairs than does barack obama mccain has now escalated his attacks by targeting obamas judgment as well especially the latters pessimism about the effectiveness of the surge in iraq there is little doubt about mccains lengthier foreign policy experience but it is not at all apparent that his judgment is superior to obamas indeed the record indicates that mccains own judgment is alarmingly bad

6359420 the recent campaign forum at saddleback church in which u s presidential hopefuls barack obama and john mccain answered questions from pastor rick warren the new star of the evangelical christian movement could only have happened in america the rest of the world watched in wonder as the two candidates proclaimed their faith before the tribunal of god trying to persuade the jury that their views on abortion gay marriage stem cell research state sponsored altruism and other value issues do not depart too much from dogma not that the conduct of warren or his followers was in any way intolerant quite the contrary both the host and the audience could not have been more congenial and fair minded but the forum highlighted the test that mccain a conservative mistrusted by many conservatives and obama a believer who some conservatives see as a closet muslim are having to pass with the evangelical community an important factor in american politics what was fascinating about the event was not the questions or the answers or even as many commentators are pointing out the stylistic differences between a socratic obama and a martial mccain it was what the forum told the rest of the world about america

6359422 its a very sad ending unfortunately hes been missing for two weeks so it was an ending that was probably to be expected
6359423 it looked like a dummy but i touched his ear it felt soft and not hard like a dummy so i knew he told reporters today adding mr denson and he were upset by the find
6359424 its not very nice not when youve got kids of your own
6359425 i just hope that it was an accident and he fell in and no rats killed him

6359431 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6359432 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6359433 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6359434 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6359435 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6359436 i told myself as i was walking to the plate that if its out over the plate im going to swing at it and thats what it was
6359437 sometimes i have to do that because ill get too picky up there and not swing and not be myself
6359438 thats not a routine play because he did a good job to get in front of it and knock it down that would have been a terrific play if he could have made it
6359439 hes got to dive and knock a ball down and get an out all at the same time
6359440 that was definitely a break to move that inning along
6359441 youre going to lose some tough ones but what really matters is what you do after that
6359442 they beat us tonight but we had our opportunities to win the game too again it just indicates we are making progress
6359443 i wont compare myself to michael phelps to win eight gold medals thats great im on the track and hes in the water you cant compare the two
6359444 the 200 has been my love since i was 15

6359464 brand watch provides tremendous insights into the minds of in market new car shoppers the very people upon which the future sales and profits of the automakers rest
6359465 in these tough economic times especially in the auto industry consumers voicing their opinions via studies like brand watch help automakers better understand how their brand is perceived right now and allow them to make real time marketing decisions that will positively affect their bottom line

6359489 i was absolutely devastated the race should not have been cancelled despite this there were still people who came and had a lot of fun there was a lot of pleasant camaraderie which becomes rivalry when its a competition

6359502 we knew the building existed as the victorians discovered it in 1880 but we re excavated it and have been studying it in minute detail using modern archaeological techniques
6359503 it is a very impressive romano british building 45m long which is big and 15m wide much in the way of a church with a central nave and two aisles
6359504 it was the main house here before the villa that is open to the public which is 4th century
6359505 everything went on in it at one end the owner and his family lived and the other end was a great open hall where the farm workers dined and all of society met the heart of the roman estate
6359506 we guessed it would be an aisled hall but what it shows us is the detail and how to fill in the picture of roman britain and of roman britain in brading it is telling a story

6359551 the first half and the second half my opinion is that in the first half both teams played well the pitch was good it was possible to play good football and we scored a goal
6359552 but in the second half it was impossible to keep playing that way and unfortunately we allowed them to score
6359553 its not really disappointing though the result was fair and today marks a good start for us with our strongest side we showed that we could play well and use our mentality to get us through in the end
6359554 we looked to play the ball on the ground between the midfield and the strikers but with the water on the pitch in the second half that became impossible
6359555 if the weather had been better then maybe we could have scored another goal but im satisfied
6359556 we are happy because the physical condition of the players is not top the english league started only two weeks ago and the norway league is already 16 games old

6359565 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation
6359566 the whole government logically is affected very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy
6359567 she said they could see the fire and then it was not even a minute or so they heard something blow up
6359568 they were about 200 meters 660 feet in the air and then they were landing but not crashing they were landing like little by little it was not like they fell down suddenly
6359569 these allegations be they true or false this one included theyre all turning points to a more open sumo
6359570 its good for the sport in the end it can open up the sport make them follow modern society
6359571 talk about freddie and fannie nationalization has helped keep mortgage spreads wide and illiquid which together with a renewed decline in the dollar and a parallel rebound in commodities supports a defensive tone in equities

6359585 julys robust rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6359586 we suspect that the official figures are still giving an overly upbeat picture nonetheless there is clearly still a risk that consumer demand remains resilient enough for retailers to try pass on more of their rises in costs to consumers continuing the upward trend in inflation
6359587 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6359588 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6359589 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6359590 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6359591 we are working hard to achieve our targets as this ensures our services continue to develop and improve
6359592 we believe it is important that our local communities take part in the annual review and have the opportunity to ask questions about our performance
6359593 give credit where its due but also to tackle tough issues and drive forward improvements
6359594 at this years annual reviews extra time has been allocated to allow additional questions from members of the public attending the review

6359598 today we are marvelling at the multiple possibilities of oyster but come back here in five or 10 years time and we will have chips inserted under our skin or inside our heads
6359599 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet
6359600 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6359601 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6359602 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6359603 its frustrating for a doctor to have to choose which prescription their patient gets
6359604 we were not computerized so we had to do that first because drug companies wants patient tax returns food stamp statements and more
6359605 last year we had 175 medical volunteers and 125 nonmedical volunteers but on a typical clinic night we have 60 70 volunteers who help
6359606 we have a 100 000 budget and that comes primarily from donations we get no government assistance we have eight churches who send monthly donations some businesses who send donations and a few local grants that we qualify for
6359607 we have different restaurants give us food on the nights we have clinic so our volunteers can come straight from work and eat saline county hospital has provided us with many things from medicine to our x ray machine and other businesses have provided us with equipment and supplies
6359608 dont eat it right away it needs to sit for 24 hours so the f lavors can develop and dont put it in the refrigerator
6359609 no salt because its already salty although some people put a little on the tomatoes basil but it must be neapolitan basil olive oil tomatoes from sorrento salad caprese mozzarella olive oil tomatoes and basil is fine but no vinegar ever
6359610 the best thing to do with fresh mozzarella is nothing at all
6359611 people defend their own cheese like they defend their favorite pizzeria
6359612 we know that not all kids like to go away to camp for an entire week so we thought it would be neat to have a camp that was a couple of days and we decided to call it home camp
6359613 the camp is for boys and girls through sixth grade
6359614 we had no idea what we were doing it was good but it could have been better
6359615 we took care of every aspect of the camp we bought food supplies and decorations made out lessons for each day prepared music rented inflatables developed questions for trivia games and did all the paperwork that included registration and insurance
6359616 we want to do more bake sales have a car wash and we want to baby sit one night at the church
6359617 students were encouraged to develop their own methods of translating ideas into form as a way of generating questions pertinent to their own practice
6359618 it provided the opportunity to study in depth the activityof drawing both as a way of thinking how we think through drawing and as a way to develop personal research
6359619 its tough right now im disappointed i wish i could have it on my own terms
6359620 i lost because of the last point rule but thats how the sport is
6359621 its all very close matches here and i was hoping to make it further but its a great learning experience
6359622 i feel really lucky to have 64 people from my hometown here including my wife
6359623 its great to have their support i could hear them cheer for me
6359624 port alberni is your typical small canadian town when an athlete makes it to the olympics the town really rallies behind them i hope this inspires other towns to do it for their athletes as well
6359625 at this point i believe that any reasonable observer already understands that age records have been forged this story now is really about internet censorship the act of removing evidence while at the same time claiming that the evidence is wrong for the first time i watched search records shift under my feet like sand facts draining down a hole in the internet will this stand
6359626 i expect a pretty dramatic improvement in his running and throwing
6359627 they are all capable of being all district type players
6359628 conway chr ist ian and lutheran are private schools so you never know what they have
6359629 quitman is supposed to be better but they didnt play a varsity game last year
6359630 this is a high character group were a little thin with not a lot of depth but were going to play hard
6359631 a is for apple j is for jacks cinnamon toasty apple jacks they must be doing something right for cheerios to make a similar cereal
6359632 in the first 100 days about 87 000 customers travelling to and from south africa used terminal 5 the experience of the vast majority of these has been good and weve been getting a lot of encouraging comments from individuals corporates and the travel trade
6359633 julys robust rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months
6359634 we suspect that the official figures are still giving an overly upbeat picture nonetheless there is clearly still a risk that consumer demand remains resilient enough for retailers to try pass on more of their rises in costs to consumers continuing the upward trend in inflation
6359635 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6359636 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6359637 athens was just pure excitement the pressure of this situation is real and it was heavy and it was loud and we beat china at home under crazy conditions
6359638 it could have been 500 degrees or 500 below and wed be happy
6359639 im so happy im just the happiest girl in the world
6359640 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do
6359641 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6359642 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6359643 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6359644 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6359645 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did tonight
6359646 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6359647 in football there are no miracles in football there is hard work to be done with the under 17 under 20 and olympic under 23 teams
6359648 where teams are successful at the youth level you have also have good
6359649 china should start again with the young players and not artificially hire a national coach and change it every year
6359650 there must be some continuity there must be a plan there must be short and long term planning
6359651 the organisation of the beijing olympics will give an impact to the development of football here but when youve seen your mens team going out in the first round then people are naturally not happy with them
6359652 it should have been a chance for chinese soccer to be honored but in the end it was dishonored what has gone wrong there
6359653 now chinese soccer is confronted with its biggest ever crisis our grassroots is withering our professional league is also spiralling downward and can produce few quality players
6359654 nous avons choisi de mieux coordonner lensemble des services qui se consacrent ladoption

6359658 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6359659 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
6359660 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
6359661 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6359662 a developing fetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning
6359663 but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6359664 nothing else good that was going on could receive any attention because of that issue
6359665 some investors have not been happy with the way that diller has managed the company and so they might be more open to looking at the pieces hes no longer associated with
6359666 our results are the best prediction we can make with the information available now but it will be critical to update the analysis as we learn more about the long term vaccine effects
6359667 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
6359668 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool
6359669 i think that a major field of application will be to help manufacturers abide by the european union law concerning the ban of dog and cat fur trade next year

6359676 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6359677 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6359678 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans
6359679 ideally we would label therapeutic cells with our cellular mri agents before they are implanted into a patient in this way we could use mri to visualize the movement of the therapeutic cells in the patient to monitor whether they migrate to and remain in the desired tissues
6359680 the 15 year programme will ensure that the united kingdom has a modernised sustainable munitions industry which will support british jobs and protect our capacity to produce ammunition
6359681 how many windmills does it take to meet the power needs of a typical city much less new york city at www scitizen com kurt cobb worked the numbers generously he presumed the windmills would use 5 megawatt turbines generating three times the output of a typical 1 5 megawatt turbine he compared that with a 500 megawatt fossil fuel coal power plant needed to power a city of 300 000 people a typical power plant he noted would cover 300 acres but use only 30 of those for the actual facility cobb calculated it would take 233 5 megawatt wind turbines to equal the coal plants output since the wind doesnt blow constantly each would need to be spaced 2 065 feet away from the others five times the diameter of their 413 foot rotors adding the rotor diameters to the spacing requirement equates to a 110 mile long line of windmills half a mile in width it comes to 55 square miles thats to provide electricity for a town of 300 000 people new york city has 8 1 million residents manhattan island totals 23 square miles so based on cobbs calculations it would take six and a half manhattan islands each covered totally with windmills to power one tenth of new york city and if standard 1 5 megawatt wind turbines were used they would take three times more space going back to kurt cobbs calculations if we wanted to meet the electric needs of 300 million americans rather than only 300 000 wed need a half mile swath of windmills each of them hundreds of feet high 110 000 miles long crisscrossing the continent 40 times between new york city and los angeles thats a lot of land to condemn the cost would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars since each large windmill costs millions
6359682 you know how you can have a star named after a person as a gift a few years ago a friend of mine received this present from her husband and i thought it was so romantic i thought ohhhhhh thats really amazing thats unbelievable this guy must really love her
6359683 i think he really begins in reality and ends up in fantasy
6359684 no he starts in fantasy and ends up in chaos
6359685 its the city it brings out the worst of people
6359686 those who had been riding the upward wave decide now is the time to get out those who thought the rally would last forever find their illusion destroyed abruptly and they also respond to the newly revealed reality by selling or trying to sell and thus the rule supported by the experience of centuries the speculative episode always ends not with a whimper but with a bang
6359687 the truth is that liquidity is the only significant weapon in the central banks arsenal but it will not necessarily go where you want it to go when you need it to go there
6359688 once public opinion is convinced that the increase in the quantity of money will continue and never come to an end and consequently the prices of all commodities will not cease to rise everybody becomes eager to buy as much as possible and restrict his cash holdings to minimum size if the credit expansion is not stopped in time the boom turns to crack up boom the flight into real values begins and the whole monetary system founders
6359689 global monetary policy must tackle inflation even if it is driven by rising food and energy prices
6359690 we are trying to use some monetary instruments to tighten monetary supply but which instruments to use it is not convenient to say
6359691 we never buy stocks when we see prices soaring we buy stocks because were confident of the companys growth people should be cautious when they see prices rising
6359692 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
6359693 there are indications that monetary policy has started to affect inflation expectations
6359694 the recent drop in current and expected inflation shows not only that it is feasible but also reinforces the bobs commitment to bring inflation back to the center of the 4 5 target in 2009
6359695 the economic dry spell should not mislead us into talking up the danger of recession
6359696 the german and the european economies remain in a robust state discussion about the end of the upturn is misplaced
6359697 the fact that weaker growth rates are expected for the economy in the near future does not mean that enough of a countervailing effect for price stability is taking shape and automatically offsetting the pressure on prices
6359698 you must never delude yourself into thinking that youre investing when youre speculating
6359699 the worst is yet to come the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think having a couple of medium sized and small banks going under are going to do the job like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players among the big investment banks
6359700 a sound banker alas is not one who foresees danger and avoids it but one who when he is ruined is ruined in a conventional way along with his fellows so that no one can really blame him
6359701 in most bull markets there comes a time when the public controls fluctuations and the efforts of the largest operators are insufficient to check the rising tide
6359702 the price of oil has fallen 20 in recent days which backs our position that this is not a problem of volume its not a problem of production but rather its linked to speculation
6359703 obviously when the price of crude oil oscillates 20 up or down in such a short time it doesnt have anything to do with production
6359704 joe will be very happy in the republican party where the dominant ethic is selfishness hes just like barry bonds when it comes to selfishness if youre hanging off the edge of a cliff by a rope you dont want to look up and see joe lieberman im sure hell be just as loyal to the republicans as he was to us
6359705 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6359706 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon

6359742 we have to keep moving if we rest we will lose the momentum from the successful armm automated elections we were able to proclaim the winner in two days if we can do it faster in 2010 and proclaim the president in one day it will be better
6359743 i asked them to do it as soon as possible there are a lot of things to be done we still have to bid the automation project and decide
6359744 i still dont know how it will work commissioner leonida will report to us
6359745 when we look at the 2010 elections we will once again look at all possible technologies we will do procurement from the very beginning definitely omr and dre will be strongly considered
6359746 its up to the advisory council to tell us they will study the glitches of course the cost is a big factor
6359747 at the latest on january 2009 we would be giving out our invitations to bid to the providers
6359748 by the first quarter of 2009 we shall be making our decision on whom we shall get as providers at the latest march of 2009 we will begin training again etc
6359749 it will not be economically feasible to do 100 percent dre roll out for 2010 one of the things were really looking for in the armm polls is how the two systems can work together

6359754 heels may look glamorous on the catwalks and on hollywood stars but theyre not appropriate for day to day work wear
6359755 these dress codes apart from being blatantly sexist can lead to long term foot and back problems as women are forced to stand or walk around in high heels or ill fitting footwear
6359756 we were surprised how many times we found that employers dress codes did not permit the wearing of comfortable sensible footwear by women
6359757 employers should look at encouraging their staff to come to work in comfortable shoes and where possible provide the option of sitting

6359759 it doesnt look anything like a plane its horrific everything is burnt
6359760 knowing the plane was bad it took off with my seven year old niece
6359761 i think what a lot of people here in spain will want to know and certainly the relatives of those who perished on the plane is if there was a technical issue with the flight which delayed its take off initially and it was then given the go ahead to take off why was that
6359762 what was the technical issue which caused the delay and why was the go ahead then given for the plane to at least try to take off and head for gran canaria

6359776 we have a growing problem on our hands that needs to be addressed in a responsible way
6359777 where our forecast indicates this product will be well utilised going forward
6359778 we understand this is a challenging time to reduce the prices we pay you for your eggs but we have no alternative but to share the burden that the market is currently enduring
6359779 we have taken a long look at the margin being made and we believe this move will still ensure producers are making adequate returns going forward based on known costs
6359780 whilst the market is facing a tough time we still believe there is a long term demand for organic eggs and for those producers already meeting the 2010 standards we believe this move will secure your future returns
6359781 the majority of our organic eggs are produced to soil association standards and this market has been less affected by a downturn in sales
6359782 however we are keeping producer prices under review in light of market conditions but will try very hard to maintain margins for producers who have faced an alarming increase in costs over the last 12 months particularly when it comes to sourcing the small and specialised batches of pullets required under the scheme

6359791 experience of migrating to britain and facing marginalisation and racism
6359792 t he failure of those with degrees to achieve anything but low grade jobs a serious criminal past travel abroad for up to six months at a time and contact with extremist networks overseas and religious naivety
6359793 this feeling is heightened by mainstream uk media coverage that perpetuates negative stereotypes of muslims by islamic and non islamic media that reports atrocities against muslims worldwide and by the extremist groups themselves who spread the message that muslims are being persecuted to the point that the only course of action is to fight back with violence
6359794 t he relationship between criminality and radicalisation is complex with some criminals attracted by the violent aspects of terrorism while others with a criminal past felt genuine regret for their activities some appeared to have turned to violent extremist groups in the misguided belief that participation in jihad might help atone for previous wrongdoing
6359795 we have noticed that terrorist groups are remarkably tolerant of individuals with serious criminal histories this is the case even when those individuals continue to be involved in very serious non terrorist crimes including drug trafficking assault and even rape
6359796 no single measure will reduce radicalisation it says but a package targeted at vulnerable groups could include providing fulfilling jobs for young people better integration of immigrants effective reintegration of ex prisoners and the provision of alternatives to the extremist pathway out of
6359797 law enforcement to disrupt existing networks remains vitally important mi5 says but the impact of those who unwittingly exacerbate the perception of threat and marginalisation must not be neglected sections of the media our own and allies governments can sometimes make statements that are unwittingly or deliberately provocative non muslim groups e g rightwing extremists can also stoke false fears and resentments which can heighten the perception of threat in muslim communities

6359800 the thing that i think has gone wrong in this debate is that the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6359801 theres actually no evidence thats the case at all theyve raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6359802 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and were over dependent on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable

6359834 people tend to purchase whats most suitable for them from what they can find this creates problems because contractors do not have insurance like estate agents do
6359835 they do not have a mechanism of punishment in case of acts of fraud the mortgage law will give people more choice because they will not be limited by the amount of money they have
6359836 with the mortgage legislation they will be able to purchase properties which cost 100 000 or 150 000 these houses will be completed ones and the buyer will be able to move into a fully completed house without facing any problems

6359875 it was a really steep bit i was just trying to climb over it half my leg went over and my knee came out but it popped back in during the fall and before i fell any further i jammed my foot in it was really sore
6359876 there was no easy way down we either had to go over the next munro and because it was mid afternoon we couldnt see anyway down before dark so we called up the mountain rescue and they said they would send somebody up
6359877 i could have sat there for hours but they were very quick they had to fly in through really low cloud but they said they could see us very quickly because the bivvy bag was bright orange
6359878 they had to come in sideways because it was so steep and narrow and landed just above us one of the guys helped me into the helicopter and i was swearing all the way because of the pain
6359879 i was in shock but didnt feel too bad when we landed at the hospital everybody was there and waiting because they had seen the helicopter id like to thank the hospital they were very good and very quick and i was very impressed
6359880 when i was sliding down the hill the only thing i was thinking was oh no whos going to drive the van now apart from my knee theres nothing wrong with me mostly because i fell on my back ive got a couple of bruises on my bum but thats it
6359881 but im just relieved i could have bashed my head or something things could have been a lot worse especially after reading about that guy who died on ben nevis so you cant feel sorry for yourself
6359882 id like to finish all the munros by the time im 40 but ill just take it easy for a while and do some low level walking
6359883 its not as fast acting as bacterial meningitis but it can kill
6359884 it was a stark reminder of how much damage meningitis can cause especially as i am considered a very fit and healthy person
6359885 her support really means a lot to us and we hope it will help highlight the importance of finding this vaccine to eradicate meningitis
6359886 i thought that was odd as i dont usually get headaches
6359887 i was really struggling in training with the hammer i couldnt do as much and my neck felt really stiff well everything felt really stiff
6359888 it just got worse and worse my head was excruciatingly sore and i went to hospital and was kept in for a week
6359889 i went in for a brain scan and eventually was diagnosed with viral meningitis
6359890 i was aware of meningitis but i didnt think id get it and ive no idea where i picked it up from
6359891 the way they reacted when i first got to hospital that was pretty scary but im still here to tell the tale
6359892 i didnt get into it until later and my main sport was spring board and high board diving until around 2000 2001 when athletics took over
6359893 it was the sheer size of it with every sport and virtually every nation involved
6359894 gladiators is amazing fun its hard too and not friendly at all
6359895 before the events were pacing up and down the corridor and we take it really seriously
6359896 the majority of us are from sporting backgrounds so were very competitive and want to win
6359897 theres a major problem there for years but it was brought to a head in february this year because sewage was coming out onto the road
6359898 it seems to be getting worse almost every time theres heavy rain sewage comes bubbling up from the drains
6359899 fife council have blocked the drains to try to stop the surface water going into the sewage pipes and forcing the sewage up but the water is running over the top and is pushed out over the road surface its broken the road surface and its channelling water down to black sands
6359900 there have been sanitary towels and faeces weve seen the whole works coming out of there
6359901 its taken six months to get any sort of action something as serious as sewage i feel should have been dealt with quicker
6359902 we can only surmise that we lost the award because we have got sewage over the sand and the water quality is therefore compromised
6359903 this year eight water quality samples were taken and all have complied with the eu bathing water directive standards that means if they apply for the award next year its very likely they would get it
6359904 although black sands is not a designated bathing water it is sampled by sepa the scottish environment proection agency for water quality
6359905 we are conducting investigations at shore road aberdour a network analyst is doing an in depth study to check sewer capacity and to locate any possible sewer breakages or blockages
6359906 scottish water recently performed a cctv survey on the immediate network and will now analyse the network outside of the immediate locality to find a solution
6359907 we are working closely with our colleagues at fife council who manage the road gullies that discharge into the combined sewer and surface water system we apologise to local residents for any inconvenience they have experienced as a result of issues with the waste water network
6359908 we were very pleased to get the award but its just something we all do as a family
6359909 children come to us mostly because their parents cant cope or theyre struggling with mental health issues or addiction but they all need love and support
6359910 seeing these children gain confidence and grow as people is priceless the most rewarding part is just seeing the children being happy
6359911 theyre all hurting and lifes not always been kind to the kids we just try to care for them and get them to trust people again you just let them come along at their own pace theyre all different and have different problems
6359912 we let them know were there to support them no matter what let them join groups and encourage them to be part of the community it takes time but i hope ive given them good experiences and memories for their future
6359913 my aunt was brought up in a childrens home and she took us to visit it when i was about 11 and it was quite a cold place it was partly because of that and because i liked children that we decided to foster i always had a desire to foster i just felt that children should live in families
6359914 it was very different in those days you wouldnt get a case history and sometimes you didnt even know a surname you had no idea what the children had been through
6359915 giving them back was always difficult and when it came to giving two year old bonnie and five day old baby paul up i couldnt do it and we decided to adopt them
6359916 the best part is it keeps you busy keeps you young and you get to go to football matches and knockhill and the like

6359941 we are one of the biggest trusts in the country and as we have seen on many other occasions this format involves comparing our trust with much smaller ones so it is very artificial and doesnt allow for a meaningful comparison at any level
6359942 last year cancelled operations represented only a small fraction just over 1 per cent of nearly 100 000 planned procedures carried out at our hospitals
6359943 any cancellation for non clinical reasons is regrettable and is only approved by a senior manager when all options to avoid it have been explored
6359944 we recognise there is room for improvement and we are working hard to further reduce the number of cancellations
6359945 having an operation cancelled can cause huge distress for patients and their families its simply unacceptable that these figures are so high and that the government is spinning the official statistics to try to hide them

6359949 maar het lijkt erop dat het vliegtuig op een van de meest kritische momenten van het opstijgen plots ernstige technische problemen kreeg
6359950 maar dit is zeker niet de enige oorzaak elke vliegtuigcrash is een samenloop van verschillende omstandigheden misschien is er ook een stuk van de motor in de staart gevlogen al is dit pure speculatie
6359951 waarschijnlijk deden de technische problemen zich voor op het moment dat de neus van het vliegtuig al in de lucht was
6359952 dit is een van de meest kritische momenten bij het opstijgen als er op dat ogenblik iets misloopt krijgt zelfs de meest geoefende astronaut het vliegtuig niet meer veilig aan de grond
6359953 maar het betekent ni t automatisch dat er iets ernstigs aan de hand was waarschijnlijk hebben de piloten in samenspraak met de technici besloten dat ze toch konden vertrekken maar dat het toestel even later neerstortte is wel iets te veel toeval

6359956 fertilisers become trading plays since the last couple of months but the last of the triggers got over yesterday and its already factored in the prices that are about the subsidy release by the government so going ahead in the next couple of months i really dont see many triggers for this sector so for the next couple of months they could remain subdued but the long term story still stands so if one has a view of one year plus then one should be buying into these stocks otherwise at least for the next 2 3 months ignore this sector

6359959 first of all 3g is not going to be a money spinner immediately at least for the next year or two at the same time yesterday the chairman of idea clearly said that the mumbai will not be profit making for them at least for the next 3 4 years the overall telecom sector is going through a margin contraction and this will continue at least for the next foreseeable 1 2 years so looking at all that it does not make a sense in investing a stock like idea because yesterday it was surely a trigger for the stock and was an opportunity for people to exit the stock i really dont see much of an upside i think the max possible upside for the stock would be around rs 90 95 and beyond that it is very difficult

6359967 if you believe the story on his myspace page clutchy hopkins is the son of a motown engineer who studied with monks fought with nigerian revolutionaries and recorded in a cave before disappearing into the desert more likely than not some semi prominent musician threw this together on his four track and thought it would be amusing to release it with a bizarre backstory either way the track name less disc ends up mixing mf doom like hip hop instrumentals with india influenced guitar tracks and some smoother downtempo work that might fool portishead fans pick it up before someone reveals that it was dj shadow all along and copies are selling for 250 on ebay
