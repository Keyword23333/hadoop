6370000 apabila keadaaan sudah jadi begini tiada siapakah yang datang membantu kamu ameerah
6370001 tiada siapa datang membantu ini semua hanya permainan politik mereka syiah bekerjasama dengan us malah tanah arab di sekitarnya turut berkerjasama dengan us mereka tidak bisa berkata apa apa
6370002 di palestin situasinya berbeza mereka mendapat simpati dari seluruh dunia kerajaan arab di sekitar datang membantu mereka orang orang yahudi membunuh hanya segolongan daripada mereka sahaja golongan mujahidin yang mempertahankan al aqsa sahaja dibunuh serta ahli keluarga mereka yang terlibat dihalau dari tanah mereka sesetengahnya tidak dibunuh tapi hanya dihalau sekiranya dibunuh mereka akan dibunuh dengan senang menggunakan senapang dengan tembakan sahaja tetapi kami mereka menyeksa mencungkil biji mata kami hidup hidup seksaan yahudi itu lebih ringan jika dibandingkan dengan apa yang syiah lakukan apa yang yahudi mahukan hanyalah tanah palestin dan tapak haikal di al aqsa
6370003 tetapi situasi kami di iraq sangat sangat genting mereka membunuh semua orang sunni mereka mahu menghapuskan sunni dari tanah iraq ketahuilah syakira apabila mereka sudah selesai di iraq mereka pasti akan beralih ke negeri lain pula
6370004 jadi saya ingin tanyakan kepada kamu syakira yang mana satu perkara yang lebih berbahaya antara dua keadaan ini palestin atau keselamatan islam dan sunni di iraq ya syakira kamu foreigners mungkin kamu tidak tahu kami ini orang arab dari tanah arab kami tahu hal yang sebenarnya terjadi
6370005 jika kamu tanyakan kepada orang palestin bagaimana kehidupan mereka sekarang mereka pasti akan mejawab
6370006 gambar gambar kekejaman yang mereka tunjuk itu adalah gambar gambar lama lihatlah pada tarikhnya sekarang ianya sudah tiada lagi saya hairan dengan orang palestin yang mempromosikan hal ini mereka kata mereka bersedih tetapi jika ditanya adakah mereka berjuang menentang yahudi mereka menjawab tidak akan tetapi jika kamu tanya mereka tentang iraq mereka tidak tahu cuba kamu tanyakan mereka tentang gambar gambar kekejaman yang berlaku sekarang mereka tidak ada
6370007 saya ada gambarnya dalam laptop saya suatu hari nanti saya akan tunjukkan pada kamu syakira apa yang saya ceritakan ini bukannya mahu menagih simpati atau belas kasihan orang ramai tetapi saya berharap benar agar orang ramai akan tahu situasi yang menggugat islam sedang berlaku

6370050 the thesis we held is what if we can figure out a way to take that branding experience and put that inside video
6370051 there needs to be a way to better monetize the video itself and how to do so in a way thats non intrusive so you dont just click it off and just disengage
6370052 part of being non intrusive is to recognize youre being marketed to the thing youve got to do is make that less intrusive and more relevant if its not relevant then you really hate it
6370053 one of the reasons i believe interactive television is not there yet is because when you come home at 10 oclock at night to watch the news you just want to watch the friggen news

6370056 barack obamas ad is ridiculous because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6370057 however if barack obama wants to have a discussion about truly questionable associations lets start with his relationship with the unrepentant terrorist william ayers at whose home obamas political career was reportedly launched
6370058 the question now is will barack obama immediately call on the university of illinois to release all of the records they are currently withholding to shed further light on senator obamas relationship with this unrepentant terrorist

6370085 alpine skiing is an exciting sport full of action and it has become very popular in the recent years the same applies to the ac drives business and vacon we started our cooperation with the finnish alpine ski team already a couple of years ago and now we want to deepen cooperation because being a sponsor of this spectacular winter sports increases our visibility in important market areas
6370086 we think that it is significant that our cooperation with vacon has reached a new level and vacon is now our official main sponsor we have fis alpine world ski championships ahead of us in 2009 and thereafter our target is set to the olympic games in vancouver in 2010 this two year agreement will give stability to our teams while they prepare for these important goals vacon is a suitable partner for us in every way both parties have made steady and strong progress in their pursuit to be world class in their own fields
6370087 both alpine skiing and the ac drives business require long term work and the ability to react quickly therefore it is natural for us to cooperate with the alpine ski team and to offer inspiring experiences to our customers and personnel in finland central europe and north america
6370088 these numbers reflect the strength of our business model at a very difficult time for the industry even though many banks would be more than pleased with a 57 percent profit growth in the first half of a year like 2008 we actually wanted even better results
6370089 business development has been a little slower than expected and we are not yet where we want to be in terms of efficiency in our execution and processes we are taking decisive action to ensure that this continues to evolve over the coming 12 months our new top management appointments are a testament to our commitment to this plan

6370091 in 2008 markets have shown quite unusual behavior and earnings volatility has been above average at saxo bank we have so far coped well with this and our focus on streamlining the business should make us even better prepared for the longer term also with our multi product trading platform we have been able to increase cfd options and futures trading which works to our benefit turbulent markets offer investment opportunities but we still urge our clients to be diligent and careful when investing and also to make good use of our support functions

6370224 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that sharif said
6370225 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition iqbal said

6370231 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6370232 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6370233 qantas has an unrivalled safety record and safety will always remain our number one priority
6370234 the company is certainly fairly well placed to share the profits with the workers who helped achieve these profits
6370235 the fuel price and the slowing economy out there are having a dampening effect
6370236 how long did it take you to think up that question
6370237 one of the major planks of the republican attack on obama is going to be his lack of foreign policy experience
6370238 and so i think he needs somebody who can be very strong in defending the obama ticket in appearing in that vice presidential debate and putting the strongest voice forward for the democratic ticket
6370239 i will nominate a person to be vice president my running mate who shares my principles my values and my priorities and thats what i can tell you

6370251 he had gone to school with the intention to make them nobody in the specific get a fright and to hurt them but he never intended to kill anyone he just wanted to express his frustration and feeling of powerlessness he wanted to be somebody

6370263 realmente no jugamos bien s lo puedo estar satisfecho con el resultado yo esperaba que pudieramos controlar mejor el juego
6370264 hay mucho que analizar y que mejorar tenemos que intentar subir nuestro nivel antes del primer partido de clasificaci n para el mundial ante israel el 6 de septiembre si queremos conseguir un buen resultado pero lo importante es que tenemos un buen equipo que puede seguir mejorando
6370265 ser a un error esperanzarse demasiado por esta victoria israel ser una prueba mucho m s complicada pese a la victoria por 4 1 el equipo no estuvo del todo bien todav a hay dudas de si con este nivel el equipo es lo suficientemente fuerte como para poder derrotar a israel el 6 de septiembre en todo caso es un exitoso debut de ottmar hitzfeld en el banquillo
6370266 i have been a dolly fan all of my life she is a wonderful woman i really connect with her music and i cant think of a better role model for my children

6370276 in the second half we could have done a lot better but it was still a decent result for us we are still building and looking to get better for the qualifiers
6370277 we have got a game before the croatian one against andorra and it is important we build on our previous games and get the points there
6370278 all the players were really disappointed with not qualifying for the euros it really hurt not to be playing there this summer
6370279 but we will give 110 to try and qualify for the world cup and we needed that sort of test against the czechs going into the qualifiers
6370280 we needed a tough game and i think we got it they were really physical and well organised
6370281 there is more to come but we are always confident we can beat any team if we play at our best and we feel we can get it right in those games ahead
6370282 i had a lot of touches in the first half maybe i could have done more with the distribution of the ball and had a few more chances
6370283 but i am happy it is another game for me i missed a few games pre season so it will help with my fitness as well
6370284 what people have got to realise as well is it is the early days of the season the lads are still getting fit and sharp
6370285 everyone needs to improve we want to win every game as the other games come along i am sure the lads will be a lot fitter and a lot sharper so we shouldnt have a problem
6370286 the manager said it was another step forward we know we have to improve we are going to improve no doubt about that i keep saying it is early in the season we have played only one league game
6370287 this seasons selection offers some of the hippest sneakers that are easy on the eye as well as the pocketbook and planet earth

6370293 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene
6370294 i eat and seduce everyone theres a lot of kissing everyone boys and girls all kinds of craziness
6370295 everybody wants to know what it was like penelope had less facial hair than a guy so it was certainly more pleasant it was better than kissing jonathan rhys meyers in match point
6370296 i was skeptical when i first became interested in this subject and im not completely convinced today i need to see proof
6370297 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6370298 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6370299 first time buyers are the people who have been hit hard we would say whatever the government can do do it for first time buyers
6370300 i cant foresee the future but i cant anticipate any further job cuts at this stage
6370301 part of the lefts ability to elevate its minor figures
6370302 there is too much political journalism and not enough politics
6370303 the media is the part of the same malign machine
6370304 there isnt anywhere like earth in the solar system so we would have to go to another star
6370305 we are really excited by the broad spectrum of games we are showcasing at the german game convention and in particular the exciting new developments on guitar hero world tour call of duty world at war and quantum of solace
6370306 not only will guitar hero world tour now be available on wii freestyle but we have added a host of iconic anthems to the european playlist to give guitar hero fans a wider choice of tracks to rock out to
6370307 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6370308 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6370309 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6370310 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6370311 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6370312 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6370313 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6370314 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6370315 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6370316 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6370317 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6370318 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6370319 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6370320 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6370321 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6370322 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6370323 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6370324 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6370325 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6370326 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6370327 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6370328 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6370329 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6370330 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6370331 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6370332 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6370333 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6370334 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6370335 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6370336 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6370337 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6370338 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6370339 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6370340 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6370341 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6370342 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6370343 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6370344 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6370345 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6370346 we have a strong squad but a young squad and mika ls versatility experience and calibre will provide the extra depth we need to reinforce our challenge for honours this season his defensive adaptability will serve us well and its a big plus that mika l has top level experience and a great understanding of football in the premier league
6370347 sign up for one of three four charter planes helicopters buses camels leaving the next morning leaving at staggered departure times
6370348 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6370349 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6370350 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6370351 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6370352 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6370353 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6370354 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6370355 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6370356 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6370357 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6370358 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6370359 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6370360 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6370361 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6370362 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6370363 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6370364 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6370365 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6370366 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6370367 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6370368 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6370369 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6370370 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6370371 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6370372 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6370373 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6370374 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6370375 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6370376 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6370377 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6370378 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6370379 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6370380 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6370381 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6370382 this is a planning took where all things are going
6370383 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6370384 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6370385 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6370386 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6370387 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6370388 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6370389 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6370390 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6370391 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6370392 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6370393 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6370394 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6370395 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6370396 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6370397 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6370398 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6370399 bouna looked even better than usual too he had a few stops that single handedly saved the tie
6370400 i think tonight we took another step im happy i saw a lot of things which i had doubts on i think well be ready for the next game im happy for the draw because the reaction to the team to the last minute was good i think also that the first half we played with good football good style and created a lot of chances
6370401 we want him to stay i think thats obvious i think the fans want him to stay and for the length of time it has gone on it is hard to pre empt anything at this minute its not completely resolved
6370402 it was a special game with a new coach and that was why it was so important to win and get off to a good start
6370403 it is clear that i will never forget these two goals with la selecci n
6370404 i have been feeling very good recently and thats why things have turned out well for me
6370405 but i will try to continue to work hard to build up the coachs confidence in me
6370406 qpr have been forced to abandon their move for erjon bogdani after the albanian international demanded wages of 1million to move to loftus road
6370407 davide is following the situation anxiously and would crawl to bologna to play for them because they are his team
6370408 this will be my second season at liverpool and hopefully i can take my game to the next level
6370409 im just focusing now on getting my fitness levels back up to 100 after that we will see what players the manager brings in during the transfer market and what my role in the team could be
6370410 we can maybe see the best from ryan this season
6370411 i can see babel emerging this season we know his potential with babel improving daniel agger coming back the younger players coming through with the senior players of more experience we have a good balance

6370633 not long ago in baghdad al qaida took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is and were going to defeat this evil and the central battleground according to is baghdad mosul basra and iraq and we are winning and we are succeeding and our troops will come home with honor and with victory and not in defeat

6370638 unfortunately this does occur and we do need the undercover officers and operations to collect evidence for convictions such as this
6370639 the community really came through and provided information throughout this investigation so its kudos to the community as well
6370640 according to the drivers statement the other two passengers were being unruly
6370641 it slightly feels like relief to know the two people accused of murdering my brother are not on the streets
6370642 is one more proof that arroyos intention has been mainly to prolong her stay in power after 2010 by deleting in the constitution that provision that limits her to only one term
6370643 arroyo is primarily accountable for the deaths of civilians in mindanao for having triggered the ongoing conflict the indiscriminate aerial and artillery bombings of villages by government forces pose as threats at the very least on the lives of civilians
6370644 we also call for an end to the ongoing hostilities between milf forces and the afp armed forces of the philippines in mindanao and the resumption of peace negotiations and the holding of all those who violated human rights and international humanitarian law to be held to account for their crimes
6370645 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6370646 kay hull therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6370647 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6370648 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6370649 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6370650 in addition the four countries involved in the pilot scheme will decide who is put forward to participate in this program and have undertaken to only propose people of good character
6370651 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6370652 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment
6370653 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6370654 i am just a poor ofw overseas filipino worker dispatcher its up to the higher authorities
6370655 based on the reports that weve received there have been no untoward incidents
6370656 we are continuing to see greater and greater economies of scale
6370657 this is driving down the cost of devices and equipment and enabling more users access to media rich services

6370678 how much insurance to buy to offset the small chance of a ruinous catastrophe that is difficult to compensate by ordinary savings
6370679 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6370680 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6370681 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6370682 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6370683 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6370684 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6370685 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care

6370687 was a creation of the jihadist culture of the pakistani army after 9 11 the white house created the political myth that musharraf faced with a clear choice had
6370688 we are trying our best to come out of this critical situation without any damage to afghanistan and the taliban
6370689 its all about overcoming social deprivation but the message still comes out that schools teachers and pupils are to blame
6370690 and its that blame and the naming and shaming culture the government has indulged in that has destroyed the confidence of 60 000 teachers and half a million students
6370691 people dont just decide to teach in an inner city school theres a lot of people who see it as a social imperative to work to deliver equality because they are caring human beings
6370692 what hurts the most is that the government message drives a stake through the heart of our self belief it feels like a personal attack
6370693 theres a fixation with a standard which is based on raw attainment of standards when there should be an equal emphasis on achievement i e the distance the student has travelled
6370694 if every school had an equal intake then attainment would be the measure to use
6370695 we know what we want to do and we will always welcome in people to pass judgment on us

6370729 but we also to make sure that when general elections are held next april that the outgoing and the incoming governments are all behind this organisation
6370730 i can tell you that they are able to organise the world cup they will do it there is a movement to say trust south africa to organise the world cup trust them
6370731 when you speak about security in south africa you give me one country in the world where security is at 100 per cent sure it is not possible

6370743 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6370744 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6370745 theyre a wonderful wonderful wonderful side it will be a tough ask but well go down there and give it our best shot
6370746 were in pretty good form we have been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6370747 but going down to a hostile environment like that weve had some good wins down there in the last few years but weve come off a couple of hidings against geelong so we need to make sure were at our best
6370748 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry its a wonderful learning curve particularly for our younger guys that we go down there play the way we want to play and do the very best we can
6370749 certainly our footy club is not in a position to play ducks and drakes or resting players whereas the cats are probably in a bit of a different position

6370761 thus i have imparted to you wisdom that is more secret profound than all that is secret reflecting over the whole teaching do as you think fit
6370762 in this age of potential bio terror and random cross species crossover horrors like the avian flu this is incomprehensible
6370763 our animals are the canaries in the coal mine and as bad as the death toll was in our pets it could have been much much worse in both animal and human populations so why is there still not a national veterinary reporting system for a nationwide emergence of disease that is not only killing animals but could also potentially already be in or emerging in the human population and why are we still unable to inspect all but the tiniest percentage of imported foods
6370764 the pet food industry as a whole took a big hit and everyone learned some lessons companies across the board are looking more carefully at sources demanding and doing more testing and upping their quality controls
6370765 the industrys responses are voluntary and they need to do more to restore trust food industries cannot be counted on to regulate themselves and until there is better regulation including fda recall authority and better labeling there will still be grounds for distrust
6370766 id like to think that some good will result from this mess and i do see hopeful signs
6370767 lots of companies say they are using better ingredients in their products being much more careful about where their ingredients come from and demanding higher standards from suppliers and co packers companies say they are testing for melamine and other toxins some of the testing is driven by retailers pet food express for example only sells products from companies that provide actual test data
6370768 the recalls exposed deep problems with food safety regulation in china as well as in the united states and i see many signs of efforts to do something about them
6370769 lasting improvements wont happen overnight and they wont happen at all unless people who care about these issues keep pressuring the industry and the fda to do what they say they will do

6370880 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6370881 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years

6370883 a violation of the mou will have to be dealt with by the mediator
6370884 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6370885 there is one stumbling issue which we have been grappling with the framework of the power and roles of the president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of the transition leading up to 2 1 2 years
6370886 we have this new experiment in africa where people who loose elections want to negotiate their way back into government
6370887 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally any steps that we take have to be by consensus

6370890 for those foolish enough to go to the stadium we could put up a giant screen and maybe we could even create an animated version of our team winning and run that on a parallel channel during the finals and everyone the players the coach the managers all the fans could be black its called transformation
6370891 what we need is a proactive effort to train the countrys future thinkers as asian governments do when they send their students to places like the uss massachusetts institute of technology this country needs to develop a corps of young leaders and thinkers who will start rebuilding this place with or without the naysayers
6370892 i am against the intellectual arrogance of white people that makes them believe that white leadership is a sine qua non in this country and that whites are the divinely appointed pace setters in progress

6370900 the stay is important because it keeps me on the ballot
6370901 even if the maine court acts and grants the stay the likelihood is that we cannot depend on them to maintain the stay until the ballots are printed were protecting ourselves by going to the u s supreme court
6370902 if its approved we then file a writ of certiorari asking for a hearing on the constitutional issues
6370903 were modestly confident they will agree to hear the case
6370904 you can sit down and talk to someone but if youve never gone through what a soldiers done its hard to get them to understand where they are coming from
6370905 it was real nice of him to think of taking a couple of people out with him
6370906 honestly were the forgotten soldiers they always remember those who died and those who are fighting but there is a group of people who are not in those categories it puts us in a dead mans place
6370907 hopefully next year they can expand and get even more guys down here on the boat
6370908 it worked out fantastic seemed like the guys had a great time it sure made me feel good
6370909 we teach kids to be less focused on themselves and more on the community
6370910 they spend a couple hours each week on the project the kids are learning leadership skills
6370911 we decided to exist to equip kids to think live and bring about change in a culture that says kids are going backward not forward
6370912 in doing my masters thesis i found that what makes a difference in a kids life is an adult whos truly involved we are deeply involved in their lives in discipling and mentoring them
6370913 we wanted to form a school where kate would both know others and be known in deeper life changing ways and be challenged in every part of her life
6370914 three teachers with 12 kids is a great ratio its challenging academically but also personally and spiritually its not for every kid
6370915 were preparing them for college in intense ways and theres also a decidedly spiritual component its the education you dream about for your kid a partnering of school with the home
6370916 they taught the kids how to fundraise how to write a fundraising letter how to make a call how to run an event make a budget and develop a profit and loss statement
6370917 they were an energetic group very focused on what they were doing
6370918 we had a conversation with nancy parsons and rosemary moore and talked about how the project would fit the needs of the council we came up with the baby bag project it was a wonderful experience for the council and the kids from veritas they got an up close look at the workings of a nonprofit
6370919 its wonderful for the council to have an opportunity to expose future leaders to community service and citizenship
6370920 it teaches them as kids to support those kinds of community activities
6370921 the tuition is 4 200 per year but well work with parents and kids if they cant afford that
6370922 distinguished civic or conservation work making permanent improvement for public benefit e
6370923 it really is a nod to a lot of effort and a lot of people
6370924 i embrace the meaning of this park and what it stands for all of us in the community
6370925 you should have a look at those words and the flags it gives me goose bumps to this day
6370926 ive been seeing people reading books or just taking walks through there
6370927 we want what is best for the students because we are trying to not have an impact on the education of the students and continue high standards of education
6370928 if the founding principle of this rsu committee is keeping a school open then lets put some teeth behind the principle
6370929 im not sure including this would float with the kennebunk taxpayers
6370930 the town currently has no protection against large extractions at the regional or state level
6370931 a reasonable ordinance will take time to craft this will give us time this is not an anti water district vote its an attempt to protect the town
6370932 testing pumping and transport of wells groundwater surface water aquifers springs and well water
6370933 transportation through wells of water that has been pumped for other locations
6370934 were concerned the moratorium would limit our ability to look for ground water in 2007 the state passed significant regulations branch brook is not going to dry up and were not going to hurt it with this
6370935 we want to allow the citizens to decide if they want to allow a high impact business in town
6370936 we would like the moratorium to protect not just the water districts land but that of private citizens were not attacking poland spring or the water district
6370937 there are thousands of acres around the aquifer that are not permanently protected
6370938 this revenue would allow the water district to buy up the acreage what if a business bought this up an industrial accident caused a toxic spill the aquifer could be ruined
6370939 i had experience some years back of going through board of environmental protection and department of environmental protection hearings
6370940 if anyone thinks your rights are protected by the bep dep or public utilities commission i have several bridges i want to sell you i think people should look at the resources in town and protect them to say the state is going to protect you good luck

6370960 i think he played me he was not honest with me as a man or as a coach and my position coach wilbert montgomery didnt have anything to say either nobody was telling me stuff
6370961 i was so happy to get out of here after the last game
6370962 playing for martz last year i hated it you dont understand how hurt i was sitting on the sidelines and not getting that many carries i mean i started the season with like 15 carries and then i got like five carries actually nine against minnesota i know they are a good run stop team but that shows you were scared of them that ticked me off how many starting running backs do you know get five carries in a game
6370963 i know we are actually going to run the ball this year we are going to have plenty of chances we know its hard to run the ball in the first quarter anyway but by the second or third quarter when our guys start wearing them down we can start popping some big ones

6370970 understandably pretty unhappy about the situation as the federal government vowed to buy up more of queenslands water for the environment
6370971 im from south australia and i understand what its like to live at this end of the river and as ive said those people who live downstream are understandably pretty unhappy about what happens upstream she said
6370972 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia he said
6370973 the murray lakes and coorong wetlands cannot be allowed to die senator brown said
6370974 its not right that you have one part of the river system that is in virtual flood and the other part that is going to die he said
6370975 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia he said
6370976 homegrown cells in combination with such instructions as could be found elsewhere
6370977 it is a recipe for disaster when you mix them together you have a cocktail for a terrorist attack he said in the nsw supreme court
6370978 guiding people how to use their own special expertise for example the booby trapping section was helpful to those with a knowledge about car electricity

6370980 wir m ssen das projekt europa allen b rgerinnen n her bringen hier haben die regierungen der letzten jahre kl glich versagt statt zu informieren einblicke zu gew hren und ehrliche ffentliche diskussionen zu f rdern hat rot schwarz die eu leichtfertig als spielball f r die eigenen interessen missbraucht wie zuletzt die sp mit ihrer inszenierten kehrtwende in der eu politik solche darbietungen halte ich f r bedenklich das zukunftsprojekt europa verdient eine faire politik
6370981 der vertrag von nizza ist ein wichtiger schritt um die europ ische union handlungsf higer zu machen eine volksabstimmung ber einen solchen vertrag halte ich nur dann f r sinnvoll wenn sie eu weit stattfindet so lange das nicht m glich ist bef rworten wir eine ratifizierung durch die parlamente abstimmungen in einzelnen mitgliedsstaaten bringen nichts weil eu fragen zu oft der dortigen innenpolitik zum opfer fallen
6370982 karin resetarits ist eine ausgewiesene europa expertin und kennt die union mit all ihren chancen und problemen in ihrer politischen arbeit hat resetarits immer wieder bewiesen dass es ihr um eine glaubw rdige und faire politik jenseits von nationalstaatlichem kleingeistertum geht
6370983 im baltikum und in den ostmitteleurop ischen mitgliedstaaten herrscht eine russophobe haltung vor w hrend westeurop ische mitgliedstaaten wie frankreich ihre eigenen machtpolitischen eitelkeiten befriedigen wollen was sich auch in der georgien frage zeigt

6371002 diese zahlen spiegeln die st rke unseres gesch ftsmodells in einer f r die branche sehr schwierigen phase wider auch wenn viele banken mit einem gewinnzuwachs von 57 prozent im ersten halbjahr eines jahres wie wir es 2008 erleben mehr als zufrieden w ren hatten wir uns eigentlich ein noch besseres ergebnis gew nscht
6371003 die gesch ftsentwicklung verlief ein wenig langsamer als erwartet und wir stehen noch nicht dort wo wir hinsichtlich der effizienz unserer anwendungen und prozesse sein wollten wir werden jedoch alles daran setzen dass wir diese entwicklung in den kommenden zw lf monaten vorantreiben werden die berufung unseres neuen topmanagements bezeugt unser bekenntnis zu diesem vorhaben
6371004 die herausforderung f r saxo bank besteht heute darin unsere globalen abl ufe zu optimieren wir werden zuk nftig noch kosteneffizienter arbeiten und unsere prozesse verbessern um auch weiterhin ganz vorne mitzuspielen dar ber hinaus ver ndert die globalisierung den globalen markt in einem rasanten tempo bei dem wir mindestens mithalten m chten wir freuen uns sehr eric rylberg und karsten poulsen an bord zu haben sie werden uns helfen unsere ehrgeizigen ziele zu erreichen
6371005 2008 haben sich die m rkte sehr ungew hnlich verhalten wobei die ertr ge durch eine berdurchschnittlich hohe volatilit t gepr gt waren bislang haben wir dies sehr gut gemeistert und dank unserer fokussierung auf die weiterentwicklung unseres gesch fts d rften wir langfristig sogar noch besser ger stet sein zudem konnten wir auf unserer multi produkt handelsplattform den handel von cfds optionen und terminkontrakten ausweiten wovon wir profitiert haben turbulente m rkte bieten investitionsm glichkeiten wir raten unseren kunden jedoch nach wie vor bei investitionen sorgfalt und vorsicht walten zu lassen und auf unsere unterst tzung zur ckzugreifen
6371006 sp handelt vp nimmt ihre eigene ank ndigung nicht ernst
6371007 w hrend sp chef werner faymann ein anti teuerungs paket angeregt hat zu dem es noch diese woche konkrete gespr che geben soll nimmt die wiener vp ihre eigene forderung nach einer sondersitzung des landtages offenbar nicht ernst obwohl vor einer woche als
6371008 die wiener sp hat sich immer gegen ein sitzungs spektakel vor der wahl ausgesprochen jetzt zeigt sich dass offenbar auch die vp selbst von dieser idee nicht berzeugt ist
6371009 und das hat wien im eigenen wirkungsbereich getan b rgermeister h upl hat eine anhebung der mieten im verantwortungsbereich der gemeinde bis jahresende bereits ausgeschlossen und auch eine geb hren anpassung wird es in wien 2008 sicher nicht geben

6371018 die massiven pflegem ngel in der illegalen einrichtung in pustritz bei denen der verdacht besteht dass sie zum tod eines menschen f hrten h tten verhindert werden k nnen die kontrollorgane der sozialabteilung haben jahrelang gewusst dass hier gef hrliche pflege betrieben wird ohne dass sie zwischen oktober 2006 bis zum todesfall im juni 2008 eine pr fung durchgef hrt h tten
6371019 es ist unfassbar dass die sozialabteilung von oktober 2006 bis zum todesfall im juni dieses jahres keine kontrolle bei rapatz durchgef hrt hat obwohl der verdacht der k rperverletzung durch nicht sachgerechte pflege bestanden hat ebenso unverst ndlich ist auch dass die beh rde nicht ersatzvornahmen angeordnet hat indem sie ausgebildete pflegekr fte in das illegale heim geschickt hat
6371020 ich werde berall dort strafanzeige wegen verdachts der k rperverletzung durch unsachgerechte pflege an die staatsanwaltschaft erstatten wo nicht qualifizierte personen pflegeleistungen illegal erbringen ich bin verwundert dass die sozialabteilung einen solchen schritt noch nicht durchgef hrt hat es w re auch dringend n tig dass die pflegegeld auszahlenden stellen bei missbr uchlicher verwendung dieses geldes sanktionen ergreifen

6371025 ziel und aufgabe muss es sein es kriminaltouristen so schwer wie m glich zu machen und sie auch bestm glich abzuschrecken
6371026 weil sich die t ter durch absetzung ins ausland oftmals der begleichung des schadens beim opfer und den kosten bei polizei und justiz entziehen muss es neue regelungen geben um hier sicherheit zu schaffen
6371027 im verwaltungsstrafrecht gibt es bereits sicherheitsleistungen wenn der begr ndete verdacht besteht dass sich der beschuldigte der strafverfolgung bzw dem strafvollzug entziehen wird oder dass dies erschwert wird ich kann mir eine solche regelung auch sehr gut f r straft ter vorstellen also wenn es um einbr che diebst hle oder sonstiges geht
6371028 es geht nicht an dass etwa buntmetalldiebe auf freiem fu angezeigt werden mit ihrem auto zur ck in ihr heimatland fahren und sich der strafe entziehen sicherheitsleistung beschlagnahme und damit der kriminellen energie die ressourcen entziehen
6371029 damit wird das opfer garantiert entsch digt und das bedeutet entlastung f r den steuerzahler
6371030 besonders bei langen autofahrten sinken bei den kraftfahrern konzentration und reaktion aber auch wenn man m glichst schnell nach hause kommen will muss sicherheit vor geschwindigkeit gehen
6371031 nur wer ausreichend abstand nach vorne h lt kann auch die fehler der anderen ausbessern
6371032 klappt das einf deln nicht mehr ist das ergebnis ein sich schnell aufbauender stau
6371033 und nicht zuletzt k nnte man auf einer urlaubsfahrt bewusst auf eine autobahn etappe verzichten und eine abwechslungsreichere und ruhigere bundesstra e w hlen
6371034 die sehr gute entwicklung bei den g steank nften und n chtigungszahlen belegen dass vorarlbergs tourismus konkurrenzf hig im wettbewerb steht
6371035 die positive entwicklung der bisherigen sommersaison setzt sich fort besonders erfolgreich sind die gewerblichen beherbergungsbetriebe mit einem plus von elf prozent im vergleich zum sommer 2006
6371036 mit einem plus von 3 5 prozent bei den bernachtungen im vergleich zu 2007 und einem plus von 3 2 prozent bei den ank nften sind hier alle erwartungen bertroffen worden wenn der herbst noch freundliches wetter bringt d rfen wir uns schon jetzt auf eine erfolgreiche sommersaison freuen
6371037 die steuerliche absetzbarkeit der kinderbetreuung n tzt nur den besserverdienern w hrend der gratiskindergarten alle familien entlastet
6371038 die familien ben tigen ab dem ersten lebensjahr eine bestm gliche unterst tzung um die notwendigen ausgaben zu finanzieren
6371039 die steuerreform ist kein selbstzweck es geht nicht prim r darum die steuern in summe zu senken sondern um eine umverteilung der steuerlast zu gunsten der arbeitnehmer und des mittelstandes die es der ffentlichen hand gleichzeitig erm glicht die notwendigen angebote f r familien aber auch f r die pflege bereitzustellen
6371040 die steuerreform ist f r mich nicht selbstzweck es geht vielmehr darum die lebenssituation der klein und mittelverdiener zu verbessern wenn die familienpolitischen ma nahmen die eine sofortige entlastung der familien bewirken dazu f hren dass das volumen f r die steuerreform schrumpft dann muss man sich den spielraum zur entlastung des mittelstandes eben durch eine umverteilung zu lasten der reichen verschaffen
6371041 nur eine rasche entlastungsoffensive kann die sich immer schneller drehende spirale in richtung armut bremsen und den armutsgef hrdeten menschen wieder hoffnung und sicherheit geben

6371043 the case is that the images on the disk are illicit or illegal and they didnt seem to relate to a professional task
6371044 not as a rival or competitor not as a thief of their property but as a partner in the boys upbringing someone to be welcomed into their home
6371045 boys want sex with men boys seduce adult men the experience is very common and much enjoyed
6371046 stuarts done photography for us for 20 years his photos adorn the walls of our offices hes made such a difference blakes a relative newcomer but hes become another angel he videotapes everything for us
6371047 they both are among the nicest people you can meet
6371048 its a great honor to be acknowledged by the portland ballet
6371049 my involvement is one of great respect appreciation and love
6371050 one of the things that impresses me about the ballet and got me involved is their attitude toward education and the wellbeing of their students
6371051 thats the most important thing in a competitive society they are one example of sanity and proper values
6371052 it started with my wife taking lessons there she mentioned to them that i had a then hobby of videography ive now turned that into a retirement business i owe a lot of that to the portland ballet ive been getting just as much as i give in the work i do for them
6371053 in the past the award has been a beautiful framed and signed photo by stuart
6371054 we thought that wouldnt be appropriate this year so this year well be giving a painting by jan roberson each recipient will receive a painting by her a signed framed work of art
6371055 they have many qualified agencies and few awards but these students deserve a stipend because they do such good work
6371056 i used to get a lot of fs in regular school but now i get as and bs
6371057 the kids that come to sweetser are hands on learners so they really need to have that hands on training available to them
6371058 a lot of people dont want to take on the responsibility
6371059 i not only felt i was blindsided by what was taking place but this board was acting not so much like a judge and jury but to me more like a kangaroo court
6371060 the actions of this board in looking to satisfy the concerns of the fire personnel on some comments i made at a brush fire at my residence have now become completely political in nature and represent little more than character assassination
6371061 in summary one need not be an attorney educated in the law to know that robert j higgins was unquestionably deprived of the fundamental rights of all citizens to due processof the law
6371062 i think that we have an obligation as citizens in our town that we treat each other with decency
6371063 its amazing how it has energized our support and our efforts
6371064 we have to keep up that energy and i think they will continue to take notice
6371065 we put it on hold for a bit but decided that it was still important to continue this effort
6371066 we have to get used to each other im coming back and have to learn maybe i can partner freddie again in the world cup qualifiers
6371067 we need to put that to the back of our minds and concentrate on the world cup qualifiers starting at home to azerbaijan on 6 september
6371068 the manager had his reasons for dropping players to the u21s
6371069 im sure that theyll be back with us in a couple of weeks and well be stronger for that

6371071 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition sharif said in an interview published in the

6371073 war on terror have called for stability in the wake of his departure
6371074 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution sharif said
6371075 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that sharif said
6371076 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition iqbal said

6371090 die beteuerungen faymanns und molterers pl tzlich alles anders zu machen sind nicht glaubw rdig sondern eine frotzelei der ffentlichkeit die realit t ist ohne eine st rkung der gr nen wird es keine echte politische erneuerung keine echte bildungsreform keine wende in der energiepolitik und keine politik in richtung mehr soziale gerechtigkeit geben

6371106 college presidents from about 100 of the nations best known universities including duke dartmouth and ohio state are calling on lawmakers to take up a national debate about lowering the drinking age saying current laws actually encourage dangerous binge drinking on campus
6371107 middlebury smith syracuse mount holyoke trinity tufts colgate kenyon and morehouse
6371108 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6371109 being recognized as a top party school is not a good thing
6371110 our survey clearly shows 75 percent of people support greater enforcement of existing underage drinking laws and increased penalties for adults who give alcohol to those under age
6371111 lowering the drinking age passes this big problem to those in the high school community already dealing with very serious underage drinking issues

6371149 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6371150 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6371151 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans

6371183 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6371184 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6371185 our close work has produced an exciting application framework upon which the industry can collaborate innovate and differentiate this effort is one of what we believe will be many exciting new ways to bring the internet to the tv and it really shows the potential of what consumers can look forward to
6371186 on the pc and mobile devices yahoo is a leading starting point for millions of consumers around the world
6371187 yahoo aims to extend this leadership to the emerging world of internet connected tv which we call the cinematic internet
6371188 there has been a lot of talk about bringing interactive internet content to the television
6371189 but none of the approaches can match the ease of use flexibility and level of customization of the widget channel framework
6371190 we believe an open platform that delivers interactive tv applications will be a key driver for our industry over the next several years
6371191 it provides a broad canvas which allows content and entertainment providers such as abc to develop interactive applications around tv content and gives advertisers new and unique ways to deliver their messages while bringing consumers an intuitive new way to enjoy tv
6371192 merging the very different user experience of the internet with that of the tv is no small task
6371193 bringing the internet experience to the television will deliver amazing new services to consumers
6371194 consumer electronics and service providers can create closer bonds with their subscribers by delivering a new experience to that allows them to easily enjoy share and access internet content through their tv
6371195 the pga from tee to green was one of the best we play tee to green but the greens were a disgrace on a course that good
6371196 i think if the members were to play at the speed of the greens we played theyd all quit there would not be any members left
6371197 i dont know what the pga was going for i dont think they should have another golf tournament there if the greens are like that
6371198 get someone to redesign the greens they were a disaster

6371222 si alg ens hagu s dit anys enrere que acudir em a explicar a lestranger com veiem el m n gastron micament parlant no ho hagu ssim cregut
6371223 comenzamos 18 abuelas a hablar de nuestras receptes y ahora ya somos unas 100 pero despu s vimos que un libro necesitaba fotos y de aqu surgi la idea de organizar una cena que hacemos cada primer s bado de julio cada una lleva una cazuela para seis personas con guisados caseros de bacalao pollo conejo la caza no nos gusta y no queremos lomo de cerdo porque guisado queda muy seco
6371224 sils es un pueblo campesino despu s de la guerra mucha gente trabajaba en el campo y no ten a tiempo de cocinar las mujeres iban al huerto y los hombres con el ganado o al campo y por tanto cada d a se cocinaba escudella catalana que era el plato principal y no daba mucho trabajo por la tarde se com a la vianda jud as de careta alubias garbanzos y lo que sobraba serv a para almorzar el d a siguiente chafada y frita con una porci n de tocino los jueves al ser media semana se cocinaba una cosa aparte normalmente arroz fideos o patatas a la cazuela
6371225 hoy en d a se come diferente y se cocina deprisa pero la cocina tradicional es para ir poco a poco y de cosa buena
6371226 el otro d a hice un sofrito con diez kilos de cebollas y tres cajas de tomates para hacer en conserva en una ma ana tuve muchos potes de sofrito con caldo de carne o de pescado se puede guardar congelado hasta 4 meses y un sofrito puedes hacer cualquier guisado en poco tiempo
6371227 el cocinero profesional falla porque tiene que comprar hechos potes muy grandes de sofrito ya que la mano de obra es cara y muchos no tienen productos naturales
6371228 hoy en d a los platos tiene todos el mismo gusto cuando fuimos al ritz vi una perola negra con caldo que me dijeron que utilizaban para todos los guisados
6371229 a mucha gente ya no le gustan los huevos de pag s o la leche de vaca natural pero el pollo que tenemos en casa no tiene nada que ver con el que se compra
6371230 ahora en octubre volveremos al ritz en noviembre a madrid y sevilla no cobramos nada pero no queremos gastar nada tampoco nos pagan el viaje y la estancia

6371246 the last 24 years youve had an opportunity to do some great things for this state and this country and in my opinion youve failed
6371247 i think you have worked with a president for the last eight years closer than anyone i think hes failed in my judgment hes the worst president in my lifetime
6371248 my opponent is a good guy ive known him for years but the reality is hes only a few years younger than i am
6371249 and his chances of being in a position im in not only for kentucky agriculture but kentucky in general is slim to say the least
6371250 i think we are going to have some debates i enjoy them
6371251 hes not going to be for any of these trade agreements that will allow you to sell your products abroad because the afl cio wont let him
6371252 i always got the feeling with sen mcconnells background that he had a briefcase in the back of his car
6371253 its interesting that my opponent was raised on a farm but other than being interesting its totally irrelevant to the issue at hand today
6371254 it s not my fault that she only has 20 000 to her name i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
6371255 they must tie together for this project to get state approval
6371256 its better at this time to put more into the district than less
6371257 i dont think the city could justify spending what that property is worth to put a farmers market in there
6371258 im opposed to moving this process forward until they provide full disclosure and explain the financial viability of the project
6371259 permitting these activities will seriously violate the intent for which these properties have been designated
6371260 leaking out of the state agencies by the people working there
6371261 it is not true that the lieutenant governor wants to open all wildlife management areas or state nature preserves to atv use
6371262 it is true we are making an inventory to understand what lands we have
6371263 a premier destination for all terrain vehicle riders horsemen and outdoor enthusiasts from across the country
6371264 we have a constant problem with atvs running through and doing damage to the grasses and so on cutting off trails and running up hills
6371265 i havent been personally lobbied but i know danny mongiardo is pushing adventure tourism
6371266 if thats what they wanted they would let us know
6371267 companies and high net worth individuals therefore have to be more vigilant than ever ensure they are taking all of the necessary measures to safeguard against this threat and generally stop and think before clicking on an attachment or volunteering information
6371268 some organizations forget to secure their web servers because the website is not seen as a revenue generating system but a media avenue public sector sites especially
6371269 we believe that this will establish the psp as a viable communication device
6371270 the mandate is to expand outside of the u s
6371271 international growth is one of our key strategic priorities and that includes boosting our ability to create programming for specific local audiences around the world

6371317 its only ever been a problem in scotland and when you first start in comedy you dont know how successful or otherwise youre going to be it was only about three years later in glasgow that i got some gyp onstage because of it around the world no one thinks anything of it
6371318 i tend not to deal with hecklers at all nowadays in theatre shows you dont want to spend the whole show talking to the drunk guy at the back with pub gigs its part of the show but it can be a bit of a catch 22 if you get on with them they think they are helping the show the great thing about stand up is the unpredictability of it you never know where youre going to end up every six months or so i take stock am i happy
6371319 theres just something about the australians that either appeals to you or doesnt
6371320 what is great about australia for me is that its still an emerging comedy market and its not as cynical as we are here now a lot of people coming to my shows can be seeing comedy for the first time and theres something beautiful about creating an atmosphere where people discover what stand up is all about in 2003 i started out there in a room above a pub to 10 people and five years on i was playing the biggest theatres in oz
6371321 i think it was just word of mouth in some ways australia is quite a small community in a huge country people in canberra talk to people in melbourne and so on and it just seemed to grow organically i did a couple of stand up spots on tv over there and it just took off
6371322 you have to show youll be an asset to their country and now i employ people there and have production managers but i did have to hand in police reports and medicals so it was pretty thorough
6371323 i found out that 10 of the people deciding about my residency were coming to one of my shows so i did take out quite a bit of swearing that night

6371339 there is no evidence to suggest there are organised gangs using the reserve for sport it appears to have been a few isolated incidents
6371340 but we would urge dog owners to be aware that they have to be responsible when using this area to exercise their dogs and have a care for local wildlife
6371341 we received two reports about two different dogs and a further two reports about the same dog
6371342 we dont know who the owners are but we have been told one of the dogs was a wolfhound and the other is believed to be a cross collie
6371343 i dont think they managed to catch up with the deer it might have been possible for the wolfhound but i think the collie would have struggled
6371344 but being pursued by dogs would obviously cause great distress to the deer and its cruel
6371345 this would be deemed a reckless act and as such is illegal under the nature conservation scotland act
6371346 people who allow this to happen can face prosecution we dont want to stop people with dogs using this space but i would urge dog owners to keep their pets under control
6371347 apart from the distress to the deer it would be very upsetting for members of the public particularly children if a dog was to catch one of them

6371353 theyve added some italians and spanish players but they are also very strong in certain areas and we have to be aware of that
6371354 i have never thought that you should be too fixated on your opponents because for me it is always how we perform that matters most
6371355 but at the same time you have to take everything into account when you prepare for games
6371356 they were both trying to take responsibility and these things happen thats football

6371435 if there was leftover bread on the table she would package it up and hand it to the customers so they could have it for their toast in the morning
6371436 then when she came back here as a girl she came through ellis island and was processed as an immigrant
6371437 it was during the depression and she ended up raising a family
6371438 her older sister was out of the house at a very early age and got married my mother had to quit school and manage the household duties

6371441 i have family members who are losing their houses their jobs i think people need to get excited about the future

6371460 last night we finally hit the sely tradewinds after a day which i can best describe as laborious we opted to cross the doldrums which stretched between borneo and singapore on the indonesian side we stayed with the breeze the whole time but some big clouds which are fairly characteristic of this zone blocked the establishing of the tradewinds and hence the hour of our deliverance we just had to be patient
6371461 eventhough you are already the state government but you still act like the opposition
6371462 in these 18 years when he governed penang from the 28th floor in komtar there had been about 10 000 pieces of paper work
6371463 if there were about 5 7 errors referring to the scandals brought up by lim it still means our performance rate was 99 9 percent
6371464 even if there were one scandal involving millions i would be very worried
6371465 because the case was still going on and it is subjudiced
6371466 a right is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a mans freedom of action in a social context there is only one fundamental right all others are its consequences or corollaries a mans right to his own life
6371467 it was the concept of individual rights that had given birth to a free society it was with the destruction of individual rights that the destruction of freedom had to begin
6371468 any alleged right of one man which necessitates the violation of the rights of another is not and cannot be a right
6371469 according to the latest internationally comparable data from the world bank individual inequality in malaysia as measured by the common gini coefficient is the second worst in all of the asian countries for which data is available only papua new guinea ranks worse

6371472 we had to dig dig dig ourselves but do not worry because when we had no resources in opposition we still managed to uncover scandals what more when we are in government
6371473 it is also interesting to note that you fail to mention that lim guan eng did not answer at all koh tsu koons question regarding the issue why the new cm keep hyping on 40 million when he also made a statement that the quarry owner have agreed to a much lower price of less than 2 million
6371474 filthy rich people trying to act more than they deserve and drain this country out of its wealth just to serve their own selfish purpose in life at the expense of others who really are in need of help
6371475 kak wan is visibly hurt by by some of the filthiest comments she has everheard
6371476 deputy housing and local government minister datuk hamzah zainuddin revealed that dato seri anwar ibrahim harassed kacau his wife in 1998 anwar wanted to take advantage of his friends wife even though they were still best friends therefore he thinks that the voters should not vote for pakatan rakyat under the helm of such person

6371483 one of my colleagues used to work for a company that decided it needed to downsize the company took the bizarre step of announcing who would be laid off in stages with each announcement coming on a friday the 13th
6371484 this creates fear and tension among employees and also creates an us vs them mentality there werent any disasters on that occasion but its not hard to imagine tensions boiling over
6371485 if you need to lay this type of person off its important to be very explicit about why they were chosen and why this was a logical decision
6371486 if its because of economic reasons be very clear that its because of economic reasons
6371487 otherwise the tendency to believe theyre out to get me often takes over
6371488 one of the worst things you can do is create ambiguity
6371489 while the managers might think they are sparing feelings they are also giving ex employees an opportunity to spin conspiracy theories which fuel anger and resentment
6371490 be kind and respectful but also as candid as possible
6371491 a big problem with these reactions is that they dont always go away once the stress is reduced
6371492 people become addicted to alcohol or irreparably harm their reputation at work or their relationships with family members
6371493 fortunately the really dramatic stress related incidents like workplace shootings are rare
6371494 reducing bad stress often can be done by reducing bureaucracy and listening to employees concerns to see if they can be addressed
6371495 what you generally dont want to do is try to reduce employees overall stress levels by taking away the good stress the aspects of a job they find enjoyable and energizing
6371496 i wish that you could manage the money to billion or 10 billion without depleting it so that the country has money to spend

6371506 theyre probably areas of the state that found the rains very beneficial
6371507 when people come into our custody we have an obligation to protect the people that do come in from each other to protect the community from escape so thats why the security is important

6371509 the first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least five years the world meteorological organisation wmo said on wednesday
6371510 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
6371511 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
6371512 the almanacs 2009 edition which goes on sale tuesday says at least two thirds of the country can expect colder than average temperatures with only the far west and southeast in line for near normal readings
6371513 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
6371514 sunday lunch is a time for everyone to share a meal and enjoy each others company
6371515 we have trouble with poor children having lower vaccination rates theyve missed so many shots by the time they arrive for kindergarten that we cant just give them a shot and bring them up to date
6371516 he almost died he had a high fever he was delirious
6371517 but i feel a great degree of guilt because i never read any toxicity studies before she got her shots
6371518 the weight of the evidence indicates that vaccines are not associated with autism but cdc knows that some parents may still have concerns about this issue so we will continue to study the role of vaccines
6371519 hed be up at 5 a m and often work until 10 p m
6371520 if it didnt rain you didnt get a day off that week even on sundays
6371521 he was a hard taskmaster but i dont regret it
6371522 i really respected him and i think i had a better life with the family than i would have
6371523 no amount of work really bothered me after that i could go after any job and think this is easy
6371524 he would get them out in the hillsides so they wouldnt bang up the ground
6371525 he had a lot of pride in his work he really had a heck of a ranch he built
6371526 he said he wasnt going to destroy what the families had built he wasnt going to break it up
6371527 he was very much 100 percent at peace with his decision of selling it and who he sold it to
6371528 they were pounding the nails out straight and putting them in a box to reuse them i thought that was so cool
6371529 i would have got away with not being injured if there hadnt been children on the playing field i turned off to avoid the kids and struck a metal fence and that was it
6371530 this is belfast at its very best bringing them out to dinner is the least i could do
6371531 the staff were phenomenal at no time when i looked at them did i see despair and believe me it was a despairing time
6371532 it was more difficult than anyone could ever imagine it was seriously challenging
6371533 but the staff along with my wife hazel gave me the strength to pull it together
6371534 the burns unit is a very difficult place to work because the injuries are so severe and the recovery is long so you have to have nursing staff who are really really dedicated
6371535 the transition after i was discharged to day to day life was hell
6371536 you have to be prepared just to get on with life
6371537 there is very little i cant do now and that is thanks to the physios of belfast
6371538 there is the trauma and the recovery from that but your body doesnt work and if you dont have the physios whove got dedication your body will never work
6371539 i had a physio who gave up her lunch hours to come in and give me extra work that is dedication
6371540 it is hard enough to maintain staff in any walk of life nurses need to be made feel so important and to validate them
6371541 since day one after being discharged ive been into the office and have done that every day since its been a very important factor in recovery
6371542 its about making goals ive just achieved my jet captains licence it is sort of a pinnacle for me and ive just taken delivery of my new aircraft life is still good

6371547 i have to say that we lived dangerously in some of our games to date and we cant take any chances obviously there is a lot of speculation surrounding the kerry game on sunday as they are tipped to go all the way which is really hardly surprising
6371548 police were called to a domestic related incident in the galliagh area of londonderry shortly before 3am on saturday morning august 16 it was reported that a man had locked himself in a house along with his two young children
6371549 a taser unit was discharged by specialist firearms officers during the incident as an appropriate and proportionate tactical option to bring the matter to a safe conclusion
6371550 at around 6 50am one 37 year old man was arrested and was subsequently detained under the mental health act
6371551 the police ombudsman of northern ireland poni was informed and are carrying out an investigation in line with agreed psni protocols
6371552 i am glad that this incident came to a successful conclusion and that no one including the children was hurt
6371553 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope these little things that have to be fulfilled are done soon
6371554 shevchenko in the rossoneri shirt there really isnt much more to be done i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan

6371563 i went to my bank and they advised me not to put the cheques in any account
6371564 they told me if anything goes wrong it will come back on me a number of people around dungiven have received these cheques all for the same amount
6371565 my son went for it because of the credit crunch he was afraid that his work would dry up but we became suspicious the minute we saw it
6371566 i would hope that other people wont be tempted to put these cheques in their accounts and that they would seek advice before doing anything
6371567 police are aware of several reports by members of the public who have received cheques in the post in suspicious circumstances
6371568 enquiries are continuing however police advise anyone who finds themselves in similar situation to contact their local station
6371569 it is not on the agenda as far as i am concerned and i will be chairing the meeting

6371572 the key priority is to ensure the protection of patients we believe that significant improvements in hospital hygiene must be achieved and we will continue to undertake unannounced hygiene inspections until we are satisfied at a time when hospitals are under considerable public scrutiny we believe that these inspections will lead to increased public confidence whilst many of the issues raised require investment others can be achieved through a change in culture within hospitals
6371573 important step towards reducing the carbon footprint of northern irelands homes
6371574 simple measures such as the installation of loft insulation can make a big difference
6371575 if the rest of the world lived as we do in northern ireland it would take three planets to support the global population
6371576 some of belfasts most desirable and valuable homes are characterised by high density
6371577 this is achieved widely in other european countries where cities of equivalent populations to belfast occupy much smaller areas
6371578 in northern ireland there are understandable historic reasons why people arent living in city centres but we must now encourage them back
6371579 development should be integrated with transport making workplaces and services much more accessible
6371580 northern ireland is one of the only rail networks in the uk that doesnt carry freight and the fact there are no rail links to any of the provinces three major airports is incredible

6371582 ive spent a large part of my career at united the last nine years and ill remember that time fondly but feel im ready for a new challenge
6371583 arsenal are known for playing technical and skilful football and have a young but experienced squad im really excited about this next stage of my career hopefully playing my part in helping the club to new successes

6371585 conway court homeless hostel in west belfast is an excellent example of partnership working between dsd the housing executive simon community and oaklee housing association

6371594 china takes 9 of the 14 olympic gymnastics gold medals
6371595 the last game against auxerre definitely ruined his desire to stay

6371597 of the deals i have mentioned two of those would be loan deals
6371598 theres one or two players we believe that people will say i didnt see that one coming
6371599 nobody has come to me from newcastle but i have found out about their interest by other means
6371600 at the present time im with real madrid and my future is here
6371601 when the league begins then we will see what my situation is but my desire is the same to work hard and have minutes on the pitch it is important that the coach trusts me its the best thing that can happen to a footballer i hope to play enough games to justify my presence i already have that confirmed from schuster in confidence
6371602 whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

6371611 torture outside the olympic village a guide to chinas labor camps
6371612 a computer illustration printed on vinyl film glued to panels and attached on the unfinished concrete skeleton of an eight story building
6371613 the site is close to changan street and the beijing hotel but for some reason the building that stood there was de constructed and then this year they started constructing there again but it could not be finished before the olympics they covered it up otherwise it would have been ugly
6371614 everything will be ok after the olympics so please endure it
6371615 when the olympics come to china everything smells and tastes differently
6371616 all three guns underwear brand with no 16 quality check number is a product from this labor camp
6371617 a diverse collection of individuals fitting no single demographic profile nor do they all follow a typical pathway to violent extremism
6371618 challenge many of the stereotypes that are held about who becomes a terrorist and why
6371619 the mamou playboys are the main thing for all of us were all musicians and so we play with other musicians but this is our band
6371620 my grandfather would have parties at his house and the greatest cajun musicians would play some of the real pioneers of this music nothing moved me like the accordion
6371621 the players in this band are all very accomplished at their instrument and with their voices we honor the traditions of cajun music and we write songs that we think can last most of it is sung in french and we stay true to a lot of the great music that we grew up with i think the mamou playboys are playing better now than we ever have
6371622 northern ireland gcse students continue to excel and should be proud of the results they have produced this year
6371623 options include staying on at school to do a levels going to a further education college and going into employment
6371624 this can be a very anxious time for young people and their parents as they often have to make decisions fairly quickly
6371625 if you do not get the grades you wanted dont panic or make hasty decisions there will be an option that will suit you
6371626 the careers service can talk you through your options and help you to make a well informed decision as well as look ahead and map out a career plan
6371627 congratulations to all involved in achieving these excellent results and the teachers and parents who inspired and motivated our young students
6371628 however while overall these are excellent results too many young people are leaving education without five gcses that is one of the reasons why i have a number of progressive reforms under way to improve the education system
6371629 if you did not achieve the results you had hoped for today is not a day to panic as there are many other opportunities available to you and i would urge you to examine these fully

6371800 creo que geijo va a venir a la real he insistido tanto en su fichaje porque hemos pensado que sus capacidades que no tienen muchos son muy complementarias a las de los jugadores que ya tenemos y adem s est dentro del marco an mico de lo que es este vestuario por los conocimientos que tengo de l como persona
6371801 lo que me da mucha pena de este asunto es que al final se ha convertido en un culebr n y la gente lo va a mirar como si fuera un salvador cuando es un futbolista como los dem s y si no se gana el lugar no jugar y que quede claro que lo traigo porque creo que es lo mejor para la real que no viene para jugar en el jard n de mi casa porque pienso en mi
6371802 yo no eludo que nuestro objetivo es subir qu le vas a pedir a la real si ha estado cuarenta a os seguidos en primera qu vas a pedir a una entidad que es la admiraci n en much simos sitios vamos a decir que el objetivo es quedar d cimos aunque nos faltase una pierna y un ojo a cada uno de los que estamos la aspiraci n es ascender
6371803 a partir de ah sab is que tenemos dependencia de que haya salidas para que haya nuevas entradas porque lo piden los administradores mi intenci n es tener veintiuno del primer equipo y al filial pero si no viene nadie m s estar rezando para que no se lesionen los que tenemos pero no pensar a que tengo que perder ning n partido si no se me lesiona ninguno
6371804 espero que se produzca la salida de alguno de los jugadores con los que no contamos pero ojala no la de uno de los que si entran en mis planes con esto no cuento vamos a ver que pasa hasta el 31 porque todav a hay tiempo para que puedan pasar cosas que si entendemos que son buenas para la generalidad las hagamos v ctor y fran m rida no los descarto pero igual hay otros
6371805 sistema s lo hay en el minuto de silencio porque luego se mueve el bal n y se mueven los jugadores estamos jugando 3 4 3 para tener claro el reparto del espacio pero luego todos los jugadores andan donde pueden lo importante es que el equipo tenga un estilo y unas ideas claras
6371806 es evidente que hay cosas que queremos hacer mejor pero algunas ya las hacemos bien lo que pasa es que algunos recuerdan algo malo cuando se han hecho cosas muy buenas quiz s por sus propios temores y si vamos para atr s dir n que porque no vamos para arriba
6371807 vamos a dejar este tema porque se trata de beneficiar a la real y no de hacerle da o cuanto m s audible y visible haga lo que paso menos ayudar al club al que represento y quiero
6371808 the true reason will be that it will kill everything some of the them have worked for their whole lives

6371810 if you do that youre not worthy of your jobs
6371811 the ability to expand the curriculum is limited by both enrollment and economic factors
6371812 it is the administrations belief that the merged district will provide programs for students that would otherwise be impossible
6371813 simply said we believe that we can accomplish more together than any one district can accomplish apart
6371814 what is important is that everybody was at the table trying to work it out
6371815 the education of the kids is what we have to keep in front of us
6371816 when the time comes im going to nip it and tuck it all

6371821 we are continually looking for ways to tweak our system to better our controls but the technology in my opinion will stay the same
6371822 having new backpacks and the dignity of choice is important to the children for their success when they return to school
6371823 some donations that we were counting on being large have come in a lot smaller but then weve had new donations that we werent even aware of that have come in
6371824 will we have enough will we be able to serve all the people
6371825 i see more multiple issues with people now it is three four five issues with one of them being my house is in foreclosure thats one of the toughest things we hear
6371826 so many of them are struggling day to day and that one thing just kind of sends them over the edge
6371827 i just reassure them that it is a difficult step so many people are embarrassed to do it but they are helping their families by doing that
6371828 are you telling me that this is actually more difficult than going through the cancer treatment
6371829 if they have a favorite character favorite color well even go into our reserve and try to match them up with something thats really special to them
6371830 it might seem like a small thing but seeing that child walk out with that special backpack and just feeling so pleased about it is enough for us
6371831 a lot of people think in this school district that we dont have a lot of need but we do approximately 10 percent of children attending our elementary schools live with families that cant provide the basic school supplies needed for each semester
6371832 if we can help create a level playing field for disadvantaged children as they enter the school year there are multiple positive results from that
6371833 it boosts their self esteem but from a more practical standpoint it gives them the tools that they need to continue their educations successfully
6371834 there is absolutely nothing that cannot be disclosed to parliament because cabinet accounts to parliament and not parliament to cabinet
6371835 but why are they so gloomy and grim how come they never smile i thought the whole point of what we do is to make others smile
6371836 son i was there i was a little kid back then but i saw it with my eyes
6371837 elfo dear where do you think you get your little inside glow from your grandfather and all the fairies at the time had a similar glow the whole village used to glow with light from a distance those were the times when they had free time for themselves and less effort to burn their light over im telling you dear elfo it was true these are not mere bed time stories
6371838 but still this is no excuse for fairies not to smile where they live and save all their smiles for other beings this cannot be fair does this mean i have to do this one day naaah this doesnt make sense
6371839 but this is still unfair why do we have to be keepers of their welfare while none of them ever think about our welfare they just keep multiplying and filling the planet to the top without a care in the world do they not ever think of how it would be with them if we ever fail to do our jobs is it not possible at all
6371840 but what if years from now it started affecting our jobs too what if the overworking and consumption prevents me and all the other fairies from carrying out our destined job why is it our destined job to just make them happy should we not have a life of our own if not for ourselves than at least to do a more spirited job
6371841 youre not elfo i havent seen him in weeks i know but i know my son elfo has a very distinctive glow that i could see from a distance you are not elfo sweety is that really you
6371842 umm elfo honey before you say more it was your great great great grandfather
6371843 i dont care this cannot keep going any longer i object to my grandfathers rules as well intentioned as he probably was he obviously wasnt very insightful
6371844 elfo respect elfo the great was one of the founders of our village he was your great great great grandfather youre named after him do not disgrace him like that
6371845 well then thats it im changing my name from now on my name is sprazzo i will not go by great elfos name or rules i will make my own rules which will strive to serve all blissens us included in the best possible just way you fairies of the village are free to follow me or to stay as miserable as you are you are not to condemn me for what you know is my lawful right as a blissen myself you are not to call me elfo i am sprazzo and i will not let my glow die out
6371846 but when im a senior is anyone going to make anything for me
6371847 you have this mind set that your senior year is going to be your year instead were going to be like the new kids in a whole new school
6371848 its like a big experiment and were the lab rats
6371849 i dont like that it will be our last year
6371850 there will be more teachers to pull from and our funding will be better
6371851 i think there will be more opportunity having a bigger class
6371852 when you go apply to colleges and youre in the top 10 percent of your class but its only a class of 50 what does that mean
6371853 were going to stay with our group and theyre going to stay with theirs
6371854 theyre going to push us all together and think its going to go well and its not going to happen
6371855 i think theyre just going to play the center kids and not the monaca kids
6371856 i was born in monaca and have gone to school there my whole life
6371857 now were going to have new teachers and theyre not going to know you in monaca everybody knows you
6371858 everyone goes to the football game every friday it just wont be that exciting at a new school
6371859 i think if were winning it will all be fine
6371860 should have more functions to try to get the monaca kids and the center kids to communicate
6371861 you need to have the 2010 11 seniors more involved
6371862 if its a vote were going to win just because were bigger
6371863 the chief of army staff coas vision has made it emphatically clear
6371864 any kind of electronic device they have on them has to be turned off if it becomes visible during the school day its taken from them
6371865 you can have them you just cant have them on
6371866 to tell a kid you cant have a cell phone in this day and age is almost ridiculous but what were asking is that they dont have them on mostly because of text messaging
6371867 ill bet we had maybe two or three last year thats a pretty low number
6371868 were stressing that under safety initiatives here that while cell phones are a convenience we ask that parents dont call your child in school
6371869 and cell phones can be a homing device so if there were god forbid a terrorist situation we want the phones off
6371870 but ill be the first one to tell you because i have kids and they have cell phones that it isnt easy
6371871 they electronics are not permitted none whatsoever in the building
6371872 i know the kids carry them and its the 21st century here but this is still a school
6371873 we encourage students to lock things up in their lockers and they are encouraged to bring their own personal locks to gym class
6371874 any time you have electronic devices in school there could be an increase in theft
6371875 the bigger problem is they do take videos weve had kids take pictures of something going on at school and they post them on youtube
6371876 not that youre trying to kid anyone that things dont happen you just dont want that stuff out there on the internet
6371877 our action provides an incentive that makes the townships position more competitive with other municipality options the company may be considering
6371878 hopefully bolttech will hire mostly local people which would be a boost to the norwin community
6371879 there were several between 1995 99 and a few since
6371880 lerta was used by the county department of community development to successfully attract industries to the industrial park along colonial manor road in the township
6371881 the origins of the hanna family the scots irish and their 18th century migration to the pennsylvania frontier
6371882 theyre eager to help and were eager to have them help
6371883 they have a different kind of knowledge and kids have a different kind of respect for them
6371884 parents trust us with their children and parents trust us to correct their children we can call parents on their cell phones and kids dont want us to do that
6371885 this initiative also enhances community relations between service providers teachers and counselors
6371886 to have all of the talent of the entire district in our building thats rich
6371887 i believe were in a position to provide the best to our students
6371888 many are hoping for change but based on experience are hesitant to believe i understand its hard to believe people can change a school district
6371889 i cant do it by myself thats why we put together the best leadership staff this district has ever seen
6371890 i just felt at that moment that i didnt make a difference
6371891 the combination of rapidly increasing costs for payroll and benefits for our police department is too much for us to handle right now
6371892 but i dont know if were ready for that just yet
6371893 the heart and soul of a town are in its people
6371894 its not in its facilities its not in its police force or ambulance service
6371895 we bring you the revenue from your outstanding receivables and make that available to the district immediately
6371896 the dramatic scenes are intense but are not too intense for a 10 year old
6371897 if we get 17 school districts we can show real change in the next five years
6371898 there is evidence that the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine does wear off after time weve seen cases of whooping cough in teens and adults
6371899 the additional doses are on top of the initial dose that you get when you are younger before you start school
6371900 they have to make that declaration and it has to be on the record and in the students file
6371901 the student who is not vaccinated is at increased risk of getting a disease but it poses no threat to the other students because the number is so small
6371902 i know space is limited but i dont feel we need to rush into renovation of the administration building i knew the district projects extra money but why spend
6371903 it would cost each member about 250 a month out of pocket
6371904 i cant see us agreeing to pay just to see ourselves on television
6371905 one door closed for me making the olympic team and another door opened
6371906 im still in her corner but from a different perspective
6371907 it doesnt really make a difference if swin was never to win a game again she could honestly say she is blessed
6371908 the end result will hopefully be a place where she can come down and run basketball camps
6371909 shes a great articulate young lady and knows the game and played in the olympics
6371910 the experience and the friendships that i made thats what i miss
6371911 if anything not making this team and having to report it has made me hungrier and more focused to be playing
6371912 i just feel to round everything out i need my second gold medal
6371913 it was an animal path that became a major indian trail
6371914 it was used for communications between villages for hunting for trading and for diplomacy
6371915 trinity lutheran held its first services in a log church very close to where the marker will stand
6371916 the land along those indian paths was prime commercial real estate
6371917 they were often the first areas to see population growth and development
6371918 what i like about the marker program is that markers raise historical awareness in the region history is not just something that happened in philadelphia or boston
6371919 i think the markers are especially important in smaller towns where local people often dont realize that something of national significance happened here
6371920 residents realize that a local person someone from their home town did something great
6371921 the markers are educational for travelers passing through who can learn something about the history of pennsylvania but they are more meaningful for local folks who can take pride in their history
6371922 weve had so much change its mind boggling but its a chance to grow and get a different point of view
6371923 what id like to say to parents is calm down let it happen and be a part of it kids are much more resilient than parents think i think they will be excited about the changes
6371924 i think the numbers are growing to larger than the district thought they would especially in the younger grades where you want smaller classes for fundamentals
6371925 yes its a clock no your mom cant read it
6371926 ok some moms can read it the kind with degrees in computer science our bad
6371927 there is evidence that the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine does wear off after time weve seen cases of whooping cough in teens and adults
6371928 the additional doses are on top of the initial dose that you get when you are younger before you start school
6371929 they have to make that declaration and it has to be on the record and in the students file
6371930 the student who is not vaccinated is at increased risk of getting a disease but it poses no threat to the other students because the number is so small
6371931 gentile lettore se alla fine di un capitolo credi di aver individuato il colpevole non perdere pi tempo e leggi dieci capitoli avanti
6371932 if there are issues i sure hope we expose it all
6371933 i think people the public needs to have confidence in local government people need to know that its clean and for those of us in office we need finality
6371934 its alright its okay you make love the other way
6371935 its alright its okay you may look the other way

6371938 these incidents have been painful for the victims and their families for priests not involved in these incidents who have served faithfully and for the whole church
6371939 based on advice from legal counsel and on prayerful reflection over this most difficult matter i believe that this settlement while costly is a responsible resolution for these individuals and their families and in the best interest of the diocese
6371940 our clients are trying very hard to right the unrightable wrong
6371941 the civil process is not something that is amenable to righting this kind of wrong but theyre working very hard to try to come to a process where children in the future are protected
6371942 im glad to see this is settled but i feel sad though
6371943 there were so many people involved families good priests good people in the church who have been hurt by this
6371944 targeted audience in basel and basel miami has seemed to be american
6371945 people like ubs who are having terrible hits really probably shouldnt have 500 million tied up in art
6371946 they have some freuds and theyve got some major pictures in their collection
6371947 theres no facility in our community that treats eating disorders
6371948 our girls have to go as far as tampa and many travel outside of florida for treatment of eating disorders
6371949 nationally 80 percent of children in need of psychiatric care are not receiving any treatment at all
6371950 theres a dire need for beds for people that dont have financial resources
6371951 i think theres an adequate number of beds for people who have the ability to pay

6371970 the government favours a dialogue as it feels that any attempts to inflame passions both in the valley as also in jammu would have a negative impact on the country with pakistan seeking to take undue advantage
6371971 we have had these shutdowns ever since the shrine land row started and there have been no sessions in the college the teaching staff doesnt come no transportation and the main issue as of now is that our exams are approaching and our syllabus is not over as yet
6371972 protesters used to shout slogans on the streets protests and agitations are staged everywhere we have been suffering for the past one and a half months our studies have suffered a lot
6371973 i am very happy he has brought about glory to the very profession of wrestling it has increased our value in the field of sports
6371974 it is a matter of happiness for us he has become a source of inspiration for the coming generations and people would now increasingly take this sport which was originally a sport of the common man

6371976 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6371977 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6371978 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution
6371979 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that
6371980 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition
6371981 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president
6371982 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus
6371983 it is vital that this piece of property is put under contract
6371984 i have a problem with what were paying for it
6371985 id much prefer that the 525k per month go to help the governors property tax campaign or to buy four new ferraris

6371988 everyone has to pay for this health care and it is too much money
6371989 when you buy more you pay less we can pass those savings onto the taxpayers and the seniors and poor who need the prescriptions
6371990 if i need knee surgery or a medical procedure i should be able to shop around and choose the best procedure for the best price
6371991 the sicker you get the more money you get for treatment
6371992 veterans receiving medical care have to drive to a clinic or veterans hospital yet people on state care get to go anywhere they want

6371995 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6371996 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
6371997 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 dollars an ounce
6371998 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6371999 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations
6372000 so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6372001 so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6372002 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost
6372003 its alright its okay you make love the other way
6372004 its alright its okay you may look the other way

6372007 it was completely a different type of performance that physically disabled children have presented its unbelievable that they had been able to perform in such a wonderful way it was a beautiful performance
6372008 it was a wonderful performance all the artistes they are so incredible that you cant say anything we dont have words to say about them but they really bring so much of emotions out of us that we really should take care of the freedom we have received just in heritage
6372009 i feel that these disabled children seek more freedom as out country has not been disabled friendly so they should be provided that type of freedom they have not been given opportunities and freedom in education and employment for that they want freedom they are enthusiastic to do something in life they have given such a wonderful performance to prove they also have a right to live in the society they seek their dignity and equality in the society they are keen to take part in the independence day celebrations
6372010 now they are coming forward they have given wonderful performance today they have conveyed a message that they are no way less than anybody they dont need anyones mercy but seek an opportunity to prove themselves
6372011 i know john mccain i know his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that

6372013 we were in the middle of kersey days when we got the bolo be on the lookout message from greeley
6372014 we had most of our officers on the street for the celebration so we were able to stop the car
6372015 one of our officers stopped two of the men and had them on the ground in the front yard of a house
6372016 then one of the other suspects trying to make it look like it was his house walked up and asked the officer what was happening our officer knew the man didnt live in that house so he arrested him also
6372017 the best things for the merchant to check are the peoples id cards and social security cards those have also been showing up as phonies
6372018 we want the impact to be as minimal as possible
6372019 we want the number of reduced hours to be as small as possible
6372020 the study found that there are clusters of departments that are overstaffed when compared to other community hospitals
6372021 we are not in financial trouble quite frankly its just the opposite but its just prudent of us to make these changes
6372022 unfortunately over the 80s and 90s there was always a kind of boundary heres hopkins and heres east baltimore we felt that this parcel could be that link that gateway for the community into hopkins
6372023 every time a shovel goes in the ground in the city it gives someone the confidence to say things are happening again lets get moving
6372024 we do not view what would be happening more than a half mile away as necessarily competitive to our efforts but i do think it behooves all of us that we do coordinate our respective efforts to ensure the future of east baltimore is a solid one
6372025 debates are part of campaigning and campaigning is part of the job
6372026 he should be here to answer why he wants to extend social security benefits to illegal immigrants i wouldnt do that
6372027 i dont think it can be untouchable theres no way to solve this unless we have a discussion about the big issues
6372028 weve got to get more of these people to talk to more people

6372040 robinho never said that he wasnt comfortable at real madrid but the thing is that he has a financial offer that is very interesting its only that

6372065 the public is sick of woefully inadequate and ineffective services
6372066 this will ensure that it is the public that is shaping our bus services
6372067 there needs to be tighter control of bus services to ensure that passengers get the services they deserve
6372068 if bus companies want to operate services they will have to offer a full service not just cherry pick the most profitable routes and times
6372069 we must take into account the social need for services where they may not be profitable and ensure that people do not become isolated within their communities
6372070 and it is tough to attract younger engineers because they know they may have a smoother career in the commercial sector where demand doesnt rise and fall on the whim of world politics
6372071 i just wouldnt want to build missiles for a living i dont think i would feel good about that kind of work for myself
6372072 im more interested in water the civil and environmental issues surrounding the use of water
6372073 it is critical that we replace these retiring engineers this is not the kind of work that we can just outsource overseas
6372074 some college students say they dont want to work on anything that kills people
6372075 well thats a hard sell in the military training business i can understand medical engineering is a popular area and being green is too but were still seeing young engineers who want a real challenge they can get that challenge here and contribute to something that is important to the country as well
6372076 this generation grew up with web technology and the virtual world
6372077 i think theres going to be pressure on the industry to send many nonsensitive engineering functions offshore because it is so difficult to maintain the recruiting base of engineers here

6372082 the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement
6372083 but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today
6372084 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6372085 some additional forces on top of that for the current fight
6372086 now that means we just need to figure out a way to get them discuss
6372087 we have all been there we call for service only to be 134 in the queue when we simply need a balance update or tracking number

6372100 how shall we escape if we neglect if we drift away
6372101 for if it is by grace than is it no more of works
6372102 john doesnt teach repentance to be saved and john is sufficient for salvation therefore repentance is not needed for salvation
6372103 is the doctrine of the rapture taught in the bible
6372104 christ is become of none effect unto you who would be justified by the law ye are fallen from grace
6372105 professor hodges if someone is trusting in christ plus works do they need to repent of their works

6372108 mccain will get them gas prices down i tell you
6372109 all that obama guy wants to do is check tire pressure some solution
6372110 at the end of aught six your republican congress passed the
6372111 yep and at the time the price of oil was about sixty bucks a barrel
6372112 in july your senator mccain reversed his 2000 position opposing off shore drilling
6372113 and shortly after received some 1 2 million in campaign contributions from big oil executives
6372114 it appears his change of opinion was purchased by big oil
6372115 theyre convinced that that is the answer more drilling i mean
6372116 but the oil companies already have some 60 million acres in oil leases theyre not now exploiting
6372117 they dont want to increase supply and risk reducing their profits increasing supply does not make good business sense
6372118 besides it would take five to ten years to even begin pumping if they started now
6372119 and even then it would do little to reduce prices

6372134 wir halten eine derartige entwicklung f r absolut denkbar denn wir revolutionieren das gesamte verkehrssystem dies wei auch die deutsche bahn als unser kooperationspartner die uns direkten zugang zu ihren entwicklern gegeben hat damit wir eine intelligente abstimmung zwischen bahn bus und taxi vornehmen k nnen
6372135 the overall sentiment remained weak with concerns about the us economic health but after the downtrend recently many of the bluechip counters are attractively valued now particularly the plantation stocks
6372136 however the investors are still avoiding the lower liners particularly the construction sector which have been under selling pressure recently and these counters might facing further selldown on lack of fresh incentives in the near term

6372146 some theories say that small black holes in globular clusters should sink down to the center and form a medium sized one but our discovery suggests this isnt true

6372149 mobile is basically built into everybodys launch strategy at this point
6372150 the whole digital revolution is really in stride basically the artists are realizing they have the ability to utilize the studio in the basement to record music and quickly get ringtones out into the hands of their fans
6372151 ringtones and ringback tones are personalization products that use music and other sounds to say something about the user of the phone
6372152 there is no indication that the demand for such products is diminishing in fact new geographic markets are still developing and as advanced networks and handsets are rolled out more technology demanding products will become available to a wider audience
6372153 i think that theres been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers which is that the perception of free content
6372154 cfd hat es uns erm glicht die kompressionseigenschaften des anzugs zu nutzen um unter r cksichtnahme auf die physiologischen und biomechanischen erfordernisse des sportlers dem k rper eine m glichst ideale form zu geben

6372159 we forecast that global mobile data revenues will only increase 77 from 2007 to 2012 compared to a 1088 increase in mobile data traffic over the same period

6372163 how can monetary base growth slow for seven straight years without pushing inflation down if you agree with friedman it should have caused a decline in inflation but every measure of inflation is higher not lower
6372164 swimming isnt as visible in this part of the country as say florida and south california and texas
6372165 there are a number of teams in new england we are going to be pushing the problem that we all face in this area is the challenge of pool space it would be great if we could use this as a launch off to keep pools open or make more
6372166 one year after the olympics we had our tryout for the lesson program which basically is learning about the sport
6372167 we had a line outside the pool and in the lobby and into the parking lot over 100 kids tried out that day
6372168 its the success a lot of good athletes just tend to gravitate toward swimming because of the success if you get a bunch of new people to try out and even half of them decide its not for them you have more people on the team that wouldnt have tried if it wasnt for the olympics
6372169 swimming is not necessarily looked on as a mainstream boys sports
6372170 phelps has given validity to the masculine aspect of the sport hes incredibly in shape and athletic even the basketball team was there rooting him on hes definitely been positive for the visibility of the sport
6372171 i think michael phelps that name will last a long time in the mainstream
6372172 rather they dont meet our needs in terms of price and quality were looking for the jets not older than five years and in good technical condition
6372173 hence our aim is to identify and take financial or operating lease on 10 to 12 lower priced second hand aircraft with relatively short after shop life to make sure that they dont entail major overhaul issues
6372174 despite an injury time act by joe cole englands supposed bright new dawn under fabio capello is suddenly looking like all our miserable yesterdays
6372175 the italian coachs ludicrous claims that his england side are a match for euro 2008 champions spain were exposed for the hollow irrelevance they were
6372176 last night england were shapeless aimless and hopeless tactically chaotic and technically stunted a mess from start to finish
6372177 if the smell of blood on the carpet at fa headquarters soho square this morning is familiar so too last night was the stale odour of an england performance that carried more than a whiff of the dregs of the steve mcclaren era
6372178 one of the worst performances ive seen from an england team
6372179 how will things change with no musharraf to pillory anymore to begin with let no one be under any illusion regarding any dignified distancing from the us that the us in its traditional casting off of third world leaders when they become politically costly and expendable has found even more loyal partners in the zardari led ppp and the husain haqqani gen durrani rahman malik troika is rooted in the linkages all three have had with the us establishment for many years now husain haqqani already had an information sharing relationship with the us when he was our high commissioner in sri lanka and ms teresita schaffer was the us ambassador in colombo pakistan paid a heavy cost for this linkage at the time also general durranis current defense security advisor and ex ambassador to us links go back to the days when he was working for shirin tahir kheli of the us establishment and this linkage continued with the formation of the balusa group ostensibly as a track 2 path between pakistan and india according to published data on the internet rahman malik had a security set up in the uk which worked closely with british intelligence so the us moved away from musharraf only after it had its other surrogates in place as well as the nro sealed
6372180 one night i was just relaxing at home watching a movie and i thought to myself why don t i look on myspace just maybe she might be on there
6372181 so i typed in her name and hers was the first picture that popped up
6372182 the first thing i asked him was have you had a good life
6372183 i just want to give him a big hug and even though he s a man and not a little boy i just want to hold him until there s no tomorrow
6372184 i just didn t know how to act it was like it was the missing jigsaw to my whole life
6372185 campbell did it with the prevalent fuel of the day we re doing it with the prevalent fuel of tomorrow
6372186 donald campbell had his massive cubic capacity engines and energy dense fossil fuels we have just the wind
6372187 but the wind will still be here in 50 or 100 years time the age of renewables has been a long time coming back but will endure
6372188 we need the weather to come right the lake is wet at the moment and it should be dry this time of year and we need the wind window which is coming any day now
6372189 the lake is 500 sq km and is a salt lake so it s very flat and we can sail in any direction it has some good wind as well but it s really the space we need
6372190 wind powered cars are the way of the future we re going to have our prototype on the road in december

6372195 they might be foreign but its important to bring in players who know the premier league

6372197 i had three players on the shopping list its gone up to four after the weekend
6372198 but the rcp average of all polls has obamas lead over mccain down to just 1 2
6372199 for the first time ever mccain leads by 274 votes to 264 for obama
6372200 it is too close to call of course but what is significant is the race is now becoming too close to call
6372201 does evil exist and if it does should we ignore it negotiate with it contain it or defeat it
6372202 evil does exist it has to be confronted but we must be humble and cautious because a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we are trying to confront evil
6372203 defeat it and i will pursue osama bin laden to the gates of hell

6372205 sollten es wirklich zu einem strikten verbot der werbung f r alkohol und des sponsorings seiner produzenten kommen dann bedeutet das einen deutlich schmaleren spielraum f r veranstalter von kultur und sportevents
6372206 statt einer generellen einschr nkung sollte die politik lieber auf eine verst rkte aufkl rung und pr vention setzen mit einer entscheidung f r ein verbot wird festivals wie dem k stritzer spiegelzelt aber auch vielen anderen veranstaltungen im kultur und sportbereich die wirtschaftliche existenzgrundlage genommen
6372207 denn es berdeckt die leistung derjenigen die ohne finanzielle zuwendungen von land oder kommunen auskommen m ssen und hochwertige und dank des sponsorings dennoch beliebte veranstaltungen anbieten in th ringen sind viele vereine und veranstalter nur durch das engagement von heimischen brauereien in der lage kleinere feiern oder gro e events durchzuf hren ich bezweifele ernsthaft ob der laut statistik sinkende alkoholkonsum durch dieses verbot st rker reduziert wird als durch regelm ige kontrollen
6372208 denmark were better than us in the first half but we reacted well and ended up playing a good game against high level opposition
6372209 we have to recognise that if it hadnt been for defender carles puyol and goalkeeper iker casillas we would have conceded at least one goal but the players confidence and skill allowed us to overcome the poor start and win the game
6372210 weve got two world cup qualifiers coming up and we have to get things right because we cant afford to make any mistakes we are the favourites to win but we cant slip up especially when we play at home
6372211 this system worked at the european championship with the players we have in the team we need to keep playing the same way and it worked against denmark especially in the second half
6372212 there are a lot of young players in this team and we havent fulfilled our potential yet
6372213 we want to continue the same progress we made at euro 2008 and with del bosque it looks as though we are going to maintain the momentum
6372214 well do our opposition meeting this morning and itll probably be a bit shorter because i think if you go into it too much it can become quite daunting
6372215 so lets concentrate on what were trying to achieve rather than looking at the whatever you want to call them behemoth
6372216 theyre a wonderful wonderful wonderful side it will be a tough ask but well go down there and give it our best shot
6372217 were in pretty good form we have been much more consistent in the back half of the year and we want to keep that going
6372218 but going down to a hostile environment like that weve had some good wins down there in the last few years but weve come off a couple of hidings against geelong so we need to make sure were at our best
6372219 i dont think we can afford to keep any of our powder dry its a wonderful learning curve particularly for our younger guys that we go down there play the way we want to play and do the very best we can
6372220 certainly our footy club is not in a position to play ducks and drakes or resting players whereas the cats are probably in a bit of a different position
6372221 theyve got three or four that have been out do they play them or do they give them an extra week to make sure theyre right
6372222 committed to bring the latest info in science amp technology and its latest reviews
6372223 the objectives of the delegation will be to reassure ourselves with the work that the local organising committee of the 2010 world cup is doing
6372224 but we also to make sure that when general elections are held next april that the outgoing and the incoming governments are all behind this organisation
6372225 i can tell you that they are able to organise the world cup they will do it there is a movement to say trust south africa to organise the world cup trust them
6372226 when you speak about security in south africa you give me one country in the world where security is at 100 per cent sure it is not possible
6372227 we know that in south africa that its not the best but if you know where the devil is then you know also how to take measures against that

6372278 ik had gehoopt dat er elke dag iets zou zijn dit is tenslotte het olympisch dorp religie is belangrijk voor atleten en ik ben ook verbaasd dat het zo in een achterafhoekje zit
6372279 de eerste preek die ik voor het olympisch dorp had voorbereid ging over coaching in veel opzichten voel ik me verwant aan coaches en de preek ging erover hoe jezus een coach was voor zijn discipelen
6372280 het is fijn om weg van huis een kerk te hebben ik had gedacht dat het wat groter zou zijn maar het was leuk zo intiem

6372290 following a strong first half of 2008 the dry bulk market has taken the usual european summer downturn and has also been affected by the olympic games as the chinese have temporarily reduced imports
6372291 the prices of both new buildings and secondhand ships have continued to firm
6372292 the negative effect should be limited as yard delays and possible cancellations increased scrapping and increased demand for commodities should balance out the market
6372293 the broader consensus was not to use force to curb the protest rallies of the separatists
6372294 though the broad consensus is to continue with a no confrontation approach there are serious issues
6372295 the desecration of the tricolour and extremely provocative slogans are a serious problem we have to deal with that too
6372296 i believe if you qualify you should be able to represent your country at the olympics and if you win or come in the first three you deserve a medal i dont think medals should just be given away
6372297 but then i would have had to deal with the problems caused by drag if my hair was hanging loose in the water you dont need that
6372298 what is important is that we understand there is a slowdown in new housing developments as a result of escalating building costs and the shortage of land and therefore we have had fewer new houses available in the market we understand that people in rdp houses and old township houses want to improve their lifestyle
6372299 doing extensions or refurbishments will also increase the value of the houses and contribute to personal wealth creation

6372313 we know of one person riding a vintage harley from brazil
6372314 im certainly not close to being one of the guys coming the furthest but its still going to feel like a pilgrimage
6372315 my wife couldnt get enough time off from work but im still going to go
6372316 im sacrificing my real family for the harley family my wifes not thrilled about this but i didnt make it to the 100th i gotta do it
6372317 i still love the organization but it was just a business move you cant mix personal things with business it was a business decision i accepted that and we moved on
6372318 they gave me an opportunity to play 11 years and take care of my family so i dont have any animosity toward this organization especially the coaching staff because the coaching staff is just like family
6372319 jeff and i talk off and on hes always wanted me to come back
6372320 its good that he feels welcome to come back in the building he knows hes welcome anytime
6372321 its just that growing spurt hes got to go through and hell realize it
6372322 people dont understand this is only his third year vince has a lot to learn he has a lot to improve on and hes willing to do that hes so competitive and he wants to do everything right and it gets to him if he doesnt live up to the fans or the coaches expectations
6372323 i expect some sales to be delayed we have written to all our customers advising them of the need to get an epc and have put together a panel of providers the problem is that vendors are not fully aware
6372324 because we are uncertain about how it affects existing clients we have not yet written to customers to advise of the legislation
6372325 this could have a severe impact on the market it is the last thing we need and we are still waiting for absolute definite clarification
6372326 i was just looking at the past history of things that have happened with other players and what the disciplinary actions were theres been a lot more violent situations but they have to do what they have to do
6372327 i get to play monday night pockets are a little lighter but i still get to play
6372328 jolly hasnt been proven guilty or hasnt been to court yet so i dont know what hes facing
6372329 but i would tell him this speak with the nfl before entering a plea agreement
6372330 if i would have fought it and it came back not guilty im sure it wouldve been a different disciplinary action from the nfl im sure it wouldnt have been that steep im not going to say my total actions were innocent on the night but there are certain situations they said happened that didnt but bottom line its all over
6372331 ive coached him for a while and ive tried not to put my nose in there too much and give my opinion
6372332 but the last couple weeks as he started to struggle i told him if you need to talk im here and when hes calling me for help he knows hes struggling a little bit but hes listened to everything ive said and he agrees its kind of a head game with him right now
6372333 clearly residential investment is the weak link in construction and the data might overstate the weakening of the sector because of their volatility
6372334 but its a sign that we have probably not seen the full impact of the downswing in residential investment and also a warning bell about non residential investment which though dynamic is not as strong as a year or two ago
6372335 in terms of nonresidential buildings there remain good investment opportunities as long as the investor has done a proper analysis
6372336 the rebound ti was expecting in late 2009 or early 2010 will not occur

6372374 the story is a long complicated one winding its way from china to france by way of the first world war the oil cartel the pharmaceutical cartel and iraq to its final destination a syringe full of something claiming to be a vaccine against the newly deadly avian flu
6372375 our best intelligence estimate is that pandemic avian flu has already been created through genetic engineering
6372376 as a physician i understand a basic virological fact that the public has not been told it is impossible to make a vaccine against a virus that does not yet exist public relations efforts to the contrary if a vaccine is being made against the avian flu virus in its pandemic form that means the pandemic virus must already exist so the fact that the avian flu vaccine is already being manufactured in china by sanofi pasteur reported to be a wholly owned subsidiary of total petroleum a french arm of the cartel supports our contention that the weaponized avian flu already exists as we saw in the case of the anthrax scare of 2001 an allegedly disgruntled government employee can release deadly toxins from even the most secure government facility
6372377 publicly available information shows the pharmaceutical industry and us government are both actively preparing for an avian flu pandemic this is shown through their own promotional literature and propaganda
6372378 the whole notion of an avian flu pandemic occurring without technological intervention is highly questionable to date there have only been around 385 human cases of avian flu identified worldwide assuming those identifications are trustworthy of course with 243 deaths to put the absurdity of this effort into perspective sudden cardiac death scd which many researchers believe is heavily associated with aspartame consumption is a leading cause of death according to the cdc for example scd killed 460 000 americans in 1999 and the numbers keep rising www cdc gov mmwr preview mmwrhtml mm5106a3 htm but aspartame a product of monsanto is an approved substance while the currently non pandemic avian flu is the focus of hugely expensive seemingly irrational preparations if there is no intent to create that very pandemic
6372379 given the shockingly obvious lack of any threat from an un weaponized h5n1 virus how can we explain the bush administration spending billions of dollars preparing each of the 50 states for what it drums into us is the

6372510 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
6372511 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
6372512 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
6372513 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data regarding efficacy and risk of sequelae
6372514 dermatologists are keenly aware of the ways skin diseases may have a substantial impact on a patients overall quality of life however in an environment in which health expenditures are allocated by non physicians it is critical to demonstrate the burden of skin disease relative to non dermatologic disease to funding sources government agencies and the lay public
6372515 in terms of social value preference weighted questionnaires are instrumental in evaluating the extent to which increased health care expenditures lead to patient benefits because they incorporate a summary description of health status social values and life expectancy
6372516 fundamentally utilities measure true patient preferences uninhibited by physician assumptions such measurement refocuses physicians on the primary goal of our profession improving the care of our patients
6372517 n o se pode lidar com estes problemas no meio de muita turbul ncia
6372518 uma vez passado este per odo como certamente vai acontecer queremos sentarmo nos e analisar qual o sistema apropriado e o papel apropriado destas institui es
6372519 langs short play the actors triumph is another publication that we intend to publish this year it is based on shakespeares romeo and juliet the play also got published in the mofussilite and was never staged we plan to enact the play this year
6372520 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
6372521 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
6372522 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
6372523 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
6372524 association between 24 hour urinary cadmium and pulmonary function among community exposed men the va normative aging study
6372525 this agreement is part of a growing movement towards collaborative approaches to first nations health a prime example of our commitment to work together to create meaningful and significant changes that will improve the delivery of health services
6372526 it will make real improvements to the health status of saskatchewan first nations people
6372527 its important that governments work together to close the gap between the health status of saskatchewans first nations people and that of the general population
6372528 this mou will be the instrument to facilitate the development of high quality accessible health and wellness programs for first nations people
6372529 we believe first nations are ready to take control and ownership of a more holistic and forward thinking health and wellness plan that meets the needs of our communities and provides opportunities for our people in all sectors of a health care system
6372530 most importantly this historic evolution of our treaty relationship will help to provide critical health care to first nation children youth and families first providing clearly a more seamless and culturally appropriate service our traditional medicines and approach to wellness must continue to drive change in todays health care system
6372531 there was some shell damage to buildings plus signs of widespread looting
6372532 there is an urgent need to provide people with food now we are particularly concerned about the people living in villages to the north of gori town
6372533 we have ordered in education and recreation kits to supply 40 000 displaced children
6372534 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 per cent between 1979 and 1984 to 74 per cent between 1996 and 2001 which is great news but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6372535 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6372536 our research has also identified cancers where survival rates remain poor highlighting the need for continuing research in those areas to drive up survival
6372537 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6372538 its important that this group of patients receive the most appropriate treatment and cancer research uk will continue investing in research to work towards this goal
6372539 these findings suggest that it is important children first learn how to calculate answers on their own but after that initial phase using calculators is a fine thing to do even for basic multiplication facts
6372540 the study indicates technology such as calculators can help kids who already have a strong foundation in basic skills
6372541 for students who did not know many multiplication facts generating the answers on their own without a calculator was important and helped their performance on subsequent tests
6372542 but for students who already knew some multiplication facts it didnt matter using a calculator to practice neither helped nor harmed them
6372543 teachers struggle with how to give kids immediate feedback which we know speeds the learning process so another use for calculators is allowing students to use them to check the answers they have come up with by themselves giving them immediate feedback and more time for practice
6372544 kids enjoyed them its one way to make memorizing your multiplication facts a more interesting thing to do
6372545 so much of how you teach depends on how you market the material presentation is very important to kids
6372546 many of these students had never used a calculator before so it added a fun aspect to math class for them
6372547 its a good tool that some teachers shy away from because they are worried its going to have negative consequences
6372548 i think that the evidence suggests there are good uses of calculators even in elementary school
6372549 the government will do all it can to support the families in this difficult situation

6372553 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the uk where we can do that
6372554 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6372555 might be useful to come out at this stage and get an update and be able to go back and brief the president
6372556 its a very gratifying time because were in a position where we believe were going to be able to hand most security functions to the iraqis

6372567 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
6372568 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
6372569 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
6372570 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it
6372571 these grants are a tremendous boon to the investigators but also to the stem cell field overall
6372572 they will fuel the research of some of the most creative stem cell scientists in the world allowing them to pursue the significant scientific challenges they have set for themselves

6372577 preventing infection in mri best practices for infection control in and around mri suites
6372578 any patient lying on an imaging table could be a carrier capable of contaminating surfaces in the radiology suite
6372579 mrsa and other pathogens can live on and in common mri table pads and positioners for periods as long as several months
6372580 at many mri centers there exists a false belief that merely placing a clean sheet over contaminated table pads without actually cleaning them between patients will somehow prevent the spread of infectious agents what is most concerning is that very few mri centers regularly clean their pads even once a day much less between patients
6372581 additionally almost all pad sets i have seen in use that are over a few years old are torn or frayed and should have been discarded long ago it is disgusting to see the terrible conditions of some of the pads that patients come in close contact with in these mri centers old torn and frayed pads are impossible to properly clean and are a breeding ground for bacteria
6372582 the best way i have found for patients to protect themselves is to ask to see the centers written infection control policies before their scans and visit the center if there are no written policies i can assure you that infection control has a low priority at that mri center and i would look for another mri center where infection control was taken seriously

6372586 drtv has enabled us to expand our offline media mix significantly over the past six months in a very competitive market where current media such as press and magazines are saturated
6372587 tmw have aided us to develop our drtv strategy successfully and we have high hopes for this media going forward
6372588 it appears that google is embracing the walled garden approach of salesforce com and microsoft instead of the cloud approach of amazon
6372589 i strongly believe that in the future most if not all server side software applications will be deployed in a cloud computing like manner
6372590 there need to be tools available that enable a developer to build and deploy an application without having to download anything to their desktop

6372593 they seem to think that during periods of lower economic activity it gives them a rare opportunity to establish themselves in new areas of emerging technology that may give them a competitive advantage down the road
6372594 its my belief that the future model for providing it infrastructure and services in large organizations will very much resemble what you describe and what many call cloud computing but will occur behind the firewall

6372597 its all about overcoming social deprivation but the message still comes out that schools teachers and pupils are to blame
6372598 and its that blame and the naming and shaming culture the government has indulged in that has destroyed the confidence of 60 000 teachers and half a million students
6372599 people dont just decide to teach in an inner city school theres a lot of people who see it as a social imperative to work to deliver equality because they are caring human beings
6372600 what hurts the most is that the government message drives a stake through the heart of our self belief it feels like a personal attack
6372601 theres a fixation with a standard which is based on raw attainment of standards when there should be an equal emphasis on achievement i e the distance the student has travelled
6372602 if every school had an equal intake then attainment would be the measure to use
6372603 we know what we want to do and we will always welcome in people to pass judgment on us
6372604 the population of the country is aging and people now live with chronic diseases longer so its important to understand from a health perspective how people are being treated as they age
6372605 older people with any physical vulnerability are about 13 percent more likely than those without one to report verbal mistreatment but are not more likely to report financial mistreatment
6372606 perhaps the respondents are including fairly routine arguments perhaps about money with their spouse sibling or child in their reports or perhaps older adults are more reticent to report negative behavior
6372607 elder mistreatment in the u s prevalence estimates from a nationally representative study
6372608 is there anyone who insults you or puts you down
6372609 is there anyone who has taken your money or belongings without your ok or prevented you from getting them even when you ask
6372610 is there anyone who hits kicks slaps or throws things at you
6372611 it has become increasingly and enticingly clear that our bodies are outfitted with an array of stem cells
6372612 according to several research articles published in just the last month adult stem cells may have a far more immediate impact on regenerative therapies than first imagined
6372613 certainly none of these reports is the final word on stem cell research but they each in their own way show how our understanding of the bodys capacity to heal is moving forward one small often molecular step at a time
6372614 the incredible promise of stem cell research to at minimum advance scientific understanding and perhaps ultimately to treat persons with devastating diseases gives moral force to efforts to conduct this research

6372624 when our rivalry can unwittingly damage the business and employment prospects of indians in companies run by pakistanis and for pakistanis in companies run by british indians those who look back cannot look forward we must look forward to living in peace and harmony not only in britain but throughout the world for our own good
6372625 our roots are the same we can always live in two countries but this should not stop us from being friends
6372626 they both remain committed to working for prosperity friendly rivalry is always good but to the extent which harms is unjustifiable
6372627 our people need bread and not bombs we are wasting our meagre resources on weapons of mass destruction when we cannot even provide clean water or feed them
6372628 to live boldly encompasses many things an invitation to act true to your nature to act in accord with your natural strengths absent that it is the vision to begin to act in accord with your inclination seeking out that thing you would like to be or face even when the natural ability or the courage isnt yet within your grasp living boldly is walking right into the thing you need at the moment and putting it on seeing how well you can make it fit
6372629 live boldly before yourself so you live through your day to that just before sleep moment where you offer yourself the certain approval today i have done my best thats when you get to present yourself a trophy a trophy for living boldly forward in your day living as if no one were looking

6372648 weve been working to find more benefits for institute members and were excited about this one
6372649 one of our goals is to help luxury home agents add the best resources to their marketing tool boxes while squeezing more value from their marketing dollars property ads in the wall street journals online edition certainly offer great exposure for luxury listings the fact that our active members get up to eighteen 60 day property listings at no cost makes this a huge benefit especially in todays market
6372650 not only will this add more marketing value to my existing property marketing plans but being able to offer to put a sellers home on the wall street journals website gives a prospective seller one more reason to list with me

6372655 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6372656 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6372663 we have plans to expand to other markets and decided to launch in thailand first as we have local offices in thailand after our huge success with asiativ com as global brand we decided to use the asiativ brand for individual markets as well
6372664 i have seen the opportunities for the thai market as internet penetration is significant and the demand for offline payment channels is still important we therefore integrated with 7 11 and the atm system
6372665 it seems as though a day cannot pass without the media touting the dismal state of our national housing market what is not discussed is that the housing market as are most markets is cyclical in nature in the lake tahoe real estate market we have seen downward trends before and we will see them again but how often have we heard the words i could have should have
6372666 it is not known how long the housing market will remain in todays current state what is known is that it has been quite some time since we have seen such levels of affordability combined with low interest rates in the south lake tahoe area
6372667 this partnership factors strongly into our plans to expand our reach on a global basis and gives the spa week brand a distinct competitive edge
6372668 this will help to set us apart from our competition and serve to underscore our intent to continually offer our consumers new and exciting cutting edge content
6372669 this is only the beginning over the next several months we intend to unveil several exciting additions to our line up of programs and content offerings so stay tuned and enjoy the ride
6372670 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6372671 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6372672 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6372673 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6372674 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6372675 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6372676 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6372677 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6372678 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6372679 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6372680 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6372681 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6372682 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6372683 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6372684 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6372685 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6372686 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6372687 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6372688 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6372689 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6372690 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6372691 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6372692 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6372693 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6372694 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6372695 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6372696 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6372697 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6372698 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6372699 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years
6372700 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

6372704 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6372705 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6372706 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6372715 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6372716 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6372717 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6372718 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6372719 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6372720 who are open to doing something on the production side
6372721 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

6372742 came into being on the basis that democracy would be strengthened and judges restored
6372743 and of course we would restore the constitution as it stood before musharraf overthrew an elected government
6372744 we are very very close to an agreement but its not done
6372745 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6372746 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6372747 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6372748 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6372749 obviously i will also check progress on the negotiations on the strategic frameworks agreement and on an agreement to allow our forces to continue to operate in iraq after the expiration of the united nations security council resolution

6372760 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that sharif said
6372761 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition iqbal said
6372762 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president mukhtar said
6372763 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus iqbal said
6372764 they have unilaterally floated the name of mr zardari it is their prerogative but we have not been consulted yet he added
6372765 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6372766 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6372767 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6372768 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6372769 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world

6372787 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6372788 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6372789 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6372790 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6372791 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6372792 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6372793 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6372794 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6372795 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6372796 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6372797 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6372798 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6372799 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6372800 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6372801 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6372802 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6372803 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6372804 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6372805 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6372806 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6372807 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6372808 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6372809 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6372810 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6372811 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6372812 deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life

6372851 people had a right to choose some got georgian passports but the larger part of the population got russian ones

6372874 unfortunately there was no chemistry between gen musharraf and afghanistan president karzai which did not facilitate cooperation between the two countries
6372875 i do not think the introduction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers

6372889 you would be absolutely psychotic not to sit down and absorb this and not move forward
6372890 youll be able to live work and play here like the early villages in the united states
6372891 my friends who are very pro urban see high gas prices as a terrific boost to urban living
6372892 im not so sure as a culture weve bought into the notion of spreading out were going to do our darndest to make it work
6372893 its a very different map than what weve looked at in the past were looking at states like alaska and georgia odd places for those of us who have been stuck in the map of the polarized american politics
6372894 i think its pretty clear that obama has his own set of strengths and his own set of weaknesses that make his candidacy not just historical but fairly unique
6372895 thats why this race is so close nationally despite the political environment totally going his way the fact this is a very close race nationally underscores challenges obama faces and not being seen as a leader
6372896 what he had to do to win the nomination has lost him a great deal on the other hand obama does have important advantages on bringing the right kind of change being on your side restoring our respect in the world those are also important presidential attributes
6372897 toward the beginning of this thing i was thinking if a republican was going to win i wish it was him
6372898 he was probably the best candidate i had but after ive seen all this other stuff and his campaigning is bothersome too ive lost almost all respect for him
6372899 just uh when obama talks he doesnt really say what he stands for you think mccain tells you what he really thinks yes
6372900 were spending too much money and too many people are dying that shouldnt be dying
6372901 this election is about two people if you go back to 1988 and look at the selection of dan quayle it was a major media firestorm at the time but proved not to be that significant in terms of how people voted
6372902 ultimately this is going to come down to the debates and how people judge mccain and obama against each other
6372903 youre going to have to change your diet youre going to have to lose weight exercise stop smoking
6372904 if its not an important priority keep doing what youre doing ill give you the pills but if you really want to be there youre going to have to change
6372905 id been using medications in these patients they were hopefully following my recommendations
6372906 we still couldnt get their blood pressure under control and i was somewhat skeptical that meditation could be the key to blood pressure control
6372907 it was a foreign concept in terms of my normal practices
6372908 their blood pressure dropped and they dropped some of their medication it was striking it was statistically significant but more important it was clinically significant to these people
6372909 its basically a plumbing problem youre pushing the same amount of blood through a bigger pipe
6372910 and thats what nitric oxide which all of us make in our body does in response to relaxation response

6372913 we got 70 concerts mostly in small towns and high school auditoriums and so it really became a trip where we tried everything out and became a trio
6372914 they said you know chamber music isnt that bad and so somehow they started to like it
6372915 its largely a testament to one man to menahem pressler
6372916 and his ability to reinvent himself as an artist and to reinvent the group around him as an artistic entity
6372917 it was almost like a piece of sand got introduced into the interior of an oyster
6372918 so there was this sense of grittiness for a while and a sense of provocation and urgency as the players got used to each other and then the rough spots and the abrasions would wear away so one way or another they take the new elements in and work it around so that everything is smoothly integrated in the end
6372919 you felt a fear that you didnt really know what it was that was pressing on your chest
6372920 and i understand now that you are going now for your careers where you have all my heart and all my wishes to both of you that you do get the career because you deserve it as musicians and as people

6372922 this act is contrary to the principles of international law we appeal to all citizens to remain calm and to offer no resistance
6372923 it was big shooting it was dramatic when they came to the studio and stopped from our broadcasting
6372924 we succeeded in informing the population and the world not only that there is invasion it was clear but that it was refused and condemned
6372925 i realized they had no idea where they are why they are here they were told of course they had to crush counter revolution but they were at such a loss
6372926 there are delegates of party congress and all wenceslas square applauding them it was first time in history somebody applauding the communists yes
6372927 it was a really huge outburst of creativity in culture in arts
6372928 civil society was being revived at a very fast pace so it was a one party state but with many different centers of independence
6372929 from this tribune you could hear really strong criticism of everything censorship and the party bureaucracy
6372930 he criticizing the whole regime as a lie and as collection of mistakes
6372931 his most famous sentence is that this regime didnt solve even one human problem and that they should be grateful if we are patient still
6372932 society got infected so to speak with this virus of freedom and people realized ok now it is our turn
6372933 i was provoked by the situation of openness free discussion it helped to orient my life it had a clear civilizing open minded effect we all were formed by 1968
6372934 the invasion destroyed the international communist movement which was i must say the main merit of this prague spring
6372935 the election is the best way to renew a political team to outline new policy for achieving those strategically correct goals that our country has
6372936 the presence of a huge and powerful parliamentary majority and the weakness of the opposition
6372937 the situation is in fact the same now or even worse
6372938 i am more than sure that right now i have to play a very active role in the country
6372939 at least from now on our policies any step taken by us must always be carefully thought through with a cold mind only then will we be able to really achieve the goals that the georgian government has
6372940 real racing will also have online features including the ability to automatically convert your most recent lap to a video and upload it to youtube

6372944 according to the drivers statement the other two passengers were being unruly
6372945 australians cannot simply rely upon emergency services to do it all
6372946 we must realise that regardless of who we are or where we live we all have a role in disaster preparedness
6372947 if people are able to sustain themselves in the immediate aftermath of a crisis it takes pressure off emergency responders who are able to focus on addressing the immediate crisis
6372948 in asking individuals within communities to go the extra mile in preparing themselves against disaster the government also expects a similar approach from private enterprise particularly the insurance industry
6372949 we want insurance companies to be clearer in telling their clients just what their insurance covers especially in defining flood events

6372953 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6372954 came into being on the basis that democracy would be strengthened and judges restored
6372955 and of course we will restore the constitution as it stood before musharraf overthrew an elected government
6372956 although i wasnt convinced with his arguments i went along i asked if the judges would be reinstated within 24 hours of impeachment and he said yes
6372957 we produced that in writing so we supported him on impeachment its now his turn to support us on reinstatement of judges
6372958 i would very much like to see this coalition stay intact but this coalition wasnt without an agenda and that agenda is strengthening democracy the rule of law and to restore the constitution and judges
6372959 the judges were removed without any constitutional authority so if we dont restore them what are we doing thats the core issue
6372960 but somebody who dismisses parliament subverts the constitution arrests the judges must tell the people why he did that he must answer these questions under whatever forum the law provides
6372961 more important than being prime minister is to put this country back on the rails
6372962 for myself or for my party i would like to have a man of national consensus

6372966 the connection between models and food was not an obvious one
6372967 dramatic loft like space with chandeliers dangling from the high ceilings like diamond earrings and sexy black leather chairs
6372968 even with the effects of the credit crisis on investment returns in the first half we have achieved a strong return on equity over the next two years we expect the diversity of our underwriting to be increasingly recognised as a key strength as rate increases in areas such as uk commercial motor and property lines help compensate for the softening of rates in other parts of our business
6372969 profit before tax is down but the real message is that we continue to deliver some very strong underwriting returns
6372970 while the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule it is accepted that words from modern
6372971 we further find that every translation made of record agrees that ammiraglia means flagship
6372972 the fact that the marks ammiraglia and flagship have the same meaning resulting in a highly similar overall commercial impression is sufficient for us to conclude that confusion is likely despite the differences in their appearance and sound
6372973 is outweighed in the context of the additional material in the mark in particular the cyrillic russian characters other english wording and design elements
6372974 key for varios operations mostly for writing numbers i hold
6372975 as lenders continue to amend the profile of the borrowers they seek to attract by changing their acceptance criteria it is a good idea to seek help from a broker
6372976 independent advice remains invaluable as it still remains very difficult to navigate the market and get an acceptance for a loan
6372977 it is undoubtedly true that the negotiators have taken this very very far toward an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today
6372978 but i will have a chance with the prime minister to really know if there are any other gaps that we have to close from washington
6372979 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6372980 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6372981 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6372982 accidents on takeoff are relatively rare the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away

6373013 as a person whose life unfolded in the lecture hall and in diplomatic negotiations melanchthon faced a different challenge than did luther who remained preacher even before his students in striking the delicate balance between holding gods and human responsibility in tension on the one hand and on the the other attempting clear explanations for curious learners or hostile negotiators for the other side melanchthon strove his entire life to reach this balance through the wittenberg way of practicing theology as he sought to divide the word of truth in wittenberg or augsburg regensburg and worms

6373024 one of these days ill sell my soul and let them find out what they bought
6373025 the last eight nine years of my life have been a mess
6373026 maybe the last two have been a little better less rolling in the trough of the wave have you ever been analyzed i was afraid of it at first afraid it might destroy the impulses that made me creative an artist a sensitive person receives fifty impressions where somebody else may only get seven sensitive people are so vulnerable theyre so easily brutalized and hurt just because they are sensitive the more sensitive you are the more certain you are to be brutalized develop scabs never evolve never allow yourself to feel anything because you always feel too much analysis helps it helped me but still the last eight nine years ive been pretty mixed up a mess pretty much
6373027 they just seem to want to hear what i have to say thats why i do all the talking
6373028 im supposed to be on a diet but the only things i want to eat are apple pie and stuff like that
6373029 that has been my main trouble my inability to love anyone
6373030 i cant love anyone i cant trust anyone enough to give myself to them but im ready i want it and i may im almost on the point ive really got to
6373031 because well what else is there thats all its all about to love somebody
6373032 he seemed to have a built in hideaway room and was always rushing off to it to worry over himself and gloat too like a miser with his gold but it wasnt all gloomsville when he wanted to he could rocket right out of himself he had a wild kid kind of fun thing once he was living in an old brownstone on fifty second street near where some of the jazz joints are he used to go up on the roof and fill paper bags with water and throw them down at the stiffs coming out of the clubs he had a sign on the wall of his room that said you aint livin if you dont know it yeah there was always something jumping in that apartment marlon playing the bongos records going people around kids from the actors studio and a lot of down and outers hed picked up and he could be sweet he was the least opportunistic person ive ever known he never gave a damn about anybody who could help him you might say he went out of his way to avoid them sure part of that the kind of people he didnt like and the kind he did both stemmed from his insecurities his inferiority feelings very few of his friends were his equals anybody hed have to compete with if you know what i mean mostly they were strays idolizers characters who were dependent on him one way or another the same with the girls he took out plain sort of girls nice enough but nothing thats going to start a stampede of competitors
6373033 its as though marlon lived in a house where the doors are never locked when he lived in new york the door always was open anybody could come in whether marlon was there or not and everybody did youd arrive and there would be ten fifteen characters wandering around it was strange because nobody seemed to really know anybody else they we just there like people in a bus station some type asleep in a chair people reading the tabs a girl dancing by herself or painting her toenails a comedian trying out his night club act off in a corner thered be a chess game going and drums bang boom bang boom but there was never any drinking nothing like that once in a while somebody would say lets go down to the corner for an ice cream soda now in all this marlon was the common denominator the only connecting link hed move around the room drawing individuals aside and talking to them alone if youve noticed marlon cant wont talk to two people simultaneously hell never take part in a group conversation it always has to be a cozy t te t te one person at a time which is necessary i suppose if you use the same kind of charm on everyone but even when you know thats what hes doing it doesnt matter because when your turn comes he makes you feel youre the only person in the room in the world makes you feel that youre under his protection and that your troubles and moods concern him deeply you have to believe it more than anyone ive known he radiates sincerity afterward you may ask yourself is it an act if so whats the point what have you got to give him nothing except and this is the point affection affection that lends him authority over you i sometimes think marlon is like an orphan who later on in life tries to compensate by becoming the kindly head of a huge orphanage but even outside this institution he wants everybody to love him
6373034 i can walk into a room where there are a hundred people if there is one person in that room who doesnt like me i know it and have to get out
6373035 i go about it very gently i circle around and around i circle then gradually i come nearer then i reach out and touch them ah so gently
6373036 i draw back wait awhile make them wonder at just the right moment i move in again touch them circle
6373037 they dont know whats happening before they realize it theyre all entangled involved i have them and suddenly sometimes im all they have a lot of them you see are people who dont fit anywhere theyre not accepted theyve been hurt crippled one way or another but i want to help them and they can focus on me im the duke sort of the duke of my domain

6373048 krs managers were hardly geniuses but blaming them for the disaster thats overtaken their former empire is like blaming the lifeguards on sri lankan beaches for the tsunami deaths what happened was and is bigger than all of us
6373049 your argument that the decline of the philadelphia newspapers was due in large part to chain ownership is unconvincing there are enough non chain newspapers out there washington dc st petersburg buffalo come to mind that would make it possible to analyze if being part of a major chain affected financial performance during the past few years

6373054 we cannot allow a situation where we talk peace we undertake a peace process and the parties concerned are taking up arms

6373057 there has been a deterioration in the whales condition over the last couple of hours weve decided it is in the best interests of the whale that it is put down
6373058 we have occasionally heard reports where a calf appears to have lost its mother and goes searching for other whales and attaches itself to the pod but theres no indication that theyre adopted and fed
6373059 it is undoubtedly true that the negotiators have taken this very very far toward an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today
6373060 but i will have a chance with the prime minister to really know if there are any other gaps that we have to close from washington

6373102 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
6373103 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
6373104 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
6373105 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it

6373159 gli stranieri inconsapevoli rischiano pesanti multe se fanno cose che sono perfettamente legali da qualsiasi altra parte del mondo eccetto in quella citt o paese dove si trovano scrive il giornale a genova per esempio ora illegale camminare per strada con una bottiglia di vino o una lattina di birra

6373170 previously batteries have only been used in small scale applications and even modern lithium ion batteries cannot boast the energy storage capacity of diesel and petroleum however scientists from the university of massachusetts may soon change all that with a combination of half a battery and half a chemical fuel cell according to the green optimistic the batterys negative electrode or cathode is made from vanadium boride this effectively serves double duty as fuel too unlike the flowing fuel of a fuel cell material is held internally much like the anode material of a battery the vanadium boride reacts with oxygen bringing in a supply of air from the outside a chemical reaction occurs and the cell has a theoretical energy capacity of 27kwh per litre compared to 9 7kwh per litre of petroleum however both figures are limited by practicalities to smaller figures yet the new system should have a usable energy capacity of around 5kwh which is still almost double that of petroleum other designs may yield even higher energy densities than the vanadium boride system a lithium air cell should give twice the energy density of a vanadium boride air cell

6373304 summers here and so its time for us all to spend as much money as we can possibly imagine on those ubiquitous festivals i myself have already rattled my way through a few and there are still more to come on my dj horizon i like them though they give me a chance to get out of the sweaty clubs and my windowless bunker of an office and get some fresh air since ive become one of these profess to be professional djs i have been especially lucky to experience the highs and lows of the music festival from the other side well i dont quite get a trailor or anything but i do get free drinks and can skip backstage as a short cut rather than stumbling along with the general public i also got a lift from westwood at last years bestival anyway what im trying to get at here is that it is the summer there are festivals happening and im playing at the big chill this very weekend yes i am i have been asked to roll up with my posse in tow and laces fattened at the soundcrash stage on friday night as well as doing a little charity work on the amnesty international stage on saturday night shazam as my man rambunctions would say
6373305 nous avons not le d part de deux petites colonnes

6373308 the victims are aged between their early 20s to one woman in her mid 60s
6373309 irregular warfare the nonkinetic solutions some whole of government approaches but particularly looking at the notion of information dominance in the battle space and things that we can do with our interagency partners to achieve effects without necessarily totally leaning on
6373310 this is a very long term strategy that we must be engaged in and it runs the gamut from just counter terrorism to counter crime to however you want to look at it
6373311 threads of violent actors that range across the scope of terrorist actors to just international organized criminals to i think narco terrorists or drug traders and then in some cases just basic gangs thieves and thugs that can come together and represent a very formidable threat to our region for a number of reasons
6373312 these are not necessarily you know standing organized armies that wear uniforms like we all envision warfare to be
6373313 it takes a different kind of tactic in terms of countering disrupting and defeating this kind of threat
6373314 if were going to establish a security line of operation in afghanistan then obviously from that you dont necessarily get security if you cant resolve the economic and agricultural conundrum of what is the money maker well its the poppy product so a strategy has got to deal with that
6373315 what do we do the military does not necessarily do that but what can we do to establish desired strategic objectives that the interagency could step up to with maybe department of agriculture u s agency for international development and state department to do that what can nato do to also help influence that
6373316 afghanistan is a different battle space than iraq so the lessons of iraq may or may not work in afghanistan
6373317 the situation is much different the people are much different the dynamics are much different so still a lot of work to be done in afghanistan
6373318 long term endeavor to engage at a strategic level to do those things across all of the many areas of need that would need to be done
6373319 a productive society that can govern and provide services to its people as well as develop a gross national product
6373320 that does not come overnight thats an institutional change that will take some time
6373321 make sure that we are comfortable with any commercial tie ups and that they make sense for the freerun lifestyle the clincher for us here is that barclaycards global ambitions for the sport match our own

6373330 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6373331 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6373332 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6373333 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6373334 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work

6373347 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process of creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and people will have a stake in the future for the long term
6373348 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6373349 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication
6373350 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart

6373357 with more time and increased number of photos we can start to identify individual cats look at which cameras they show up on to get an idea of range and possible range overlap with the smaller cats
6373358 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6373359 kay hull therefore i presume the national party the national farmers federation appear to be supporting the governments position yet we have mr nelson rowing in exactly the reverse direction
6373360 i think it is time the liberal and national party the opposition sorted out whether they have got any policy on this at all
6373361 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6373362 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6373363 in addition the four countries involved in the pilot scheme will decide who is put forward to participate in this program and have undertaken to only propose people of good character
6373364 im representing my electorate we badly want a program like this weve argued for it for years and subject to the detail im supporting it
6373365 look i honestly cant understand just where the direction is coming from at the moment
6373366 i am not sure where the advice is coming on this and im you know i am aware that if there were concerns about health issues and criminal checks and etc that there are significant guidelines and criteria to be put in place to cover all of those aspects
6373367 highly opportunistic does not come close to the true value of continental does not create trust and lacks a convincing strategic rationale
6373368 following the hard work over the last weeks continental has come to an acceptable overall concept
6373369 for its costumers continental remains a reliable long term partner that is extremely well positioned the continental employees can continue to rely on the clear focus of our concept for the future which we have developed over the last years
6373370 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6373371 when you are in hospital and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to want to think about the next day or week you just think about the next hour
6373372 it teaches you to be patient when you are lying in a hospital bed and that was almost the same strategy i chose here to wait for my chance in the pack
6373373 australians cannot simply rely upon emergency services to do it all
6373374 we must realise that regardless of who we are or where we live we all have a role in disaster preparedness
6373375 if people are able to sustain themselves in the immediate aftermath of a crisis it takes pressure off emergency responders who are able to focus on addressing the immediate crisis
6373376 in asking individuals within communities to go the extra mile in preparing themselves against disaster the government also expects a similar approach from private enterprise particularly the insurance industry
6373377 we want insurance companies to be clearer in telling their clients just what their insurance covers especially in defining flood events

6373484 first thing id do as president is to go to see the speaker of the house and the majority leader of the senate i assume that that would be sen reid i hope not but i think thats probably the reality of this election and i would say lets have an agenda lets work together we know what the solutions are and we know what the options are on restraining spending on medicare on all of these energy independence on all of these issues

6373544 pre rolls post rolls and banner ads are too intrusive and are ineffective
6373545 the thesis we held is what if we can figure out a way to take that branding experience and put that inside video
6373546 there needs to be a way to better monetize the video itself and how to do so in a way thats non intrusive so you dont just click it off and just disengage
6373547 part of being non intrusive is to recognize youre being marketed to the thing youve got to do is make that less intrusive and more relevant if its not relevant then you really hate it
6373548 one of the reasons i believe interactive television is not there yet is because when you come home at 10 oclock at night to watch the news you just want to watch the friggen news

6373556 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6373557 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6373558 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim
6373559 while these concerns are understandable their actual impact likely is overstated although there may be cases in which such considerations will arise there are likely to be few in which a copyright owners determination that a particular use is not fair use will meet the requisite standard of subjective bad faith required to prevail in an action for misrepresentation
6373560 considerable doubt that lenz will be able to prove that universal acted with subjective bad faith
6373561 while the court merely declined to throw the case out at this early pleadings stage
6373562 we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter
6373563 i hope to live up to it to the best of my capabilities today rediffusion is brimming with the energy to excel beyond expectations and our work is comparable with the best i look forward to taking on the role of group ceo and ensuring that the same energy and excellence now pervades all our endeavours across the entire group

6373589 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6373590 tell anybody youre a sculptor and theyll say oh how exciting how wonderful and i tend to say whats so wonderful its like being a mason or a carpenter half the time but they dont wish to hear that because they really only imagine the first part the exciting part but as khrushchev once said that doesnt fry pancakes you see that germ of an idea does not make a sculpture which stands up it just sits there so the next stage is the hard work can you really translate it into a piece of sculpture
6373591 when i have a job that takes a lot of effort slowly i pretend im in jail if im in jail time is of no consequence in other words if it takes a week to cut this itll take a week what else have i got to do im going to be here for twenty years see this is a kind of mental trick otherwise you say my god its not working and then you make mistakes my way you say time is of absolutely no consequence
6373592 this idea to create something is not my aim to be different is a negative motive and no creative thought or created thing grows out of a negative impulse a negative impulse is always frustrating and to be different means not like this and not like that and the not like thats why postmodernism with the prefix of post couldnt work no negative impulse can work can produce any happy creation only a positive one
6373593 id say one of the most common failures of able people is a lack of nerve theyll play safe games in innovation you have to play a less safe game if its going to be interesting its not predictable that itll go well
6373594 i think it is very important to find a way to be detached from what you write so that you cant be so identified with your work that you cant accept criticism and response and that is the danger of having as much affect as i do but i am aware of that and of when i think it is particularly important to detach oneself from the work and that is something where age really does help

6373597 what force india has proved is that we look competitive in race conditions and under the right circumstances can pick up points if the chances come our way
6373598 weve performed well on street courses too and with two in the final part this could be a good opportunity for us
6373599 we need to look for 100 reliability to ensure that whenever these chances come our way we are really able to take advantage
6373600 if we take our eye off the ball we could miss out on getting some good finishes
6373601 that said work for 2009 will step up immensely towards the end of the season so we can make sure we are ready

6373620 the players in this band are all very accomplished at their instrument and with their voices we honor the traditions of cajun music and we write songs that we think can last most of it is sung in french and we stay true to a lot of the great music that we grew up with i think the mamou playboys are playing better now than we ever have

6373661 ich will nicht anma end klingen aber es gab einen gro en territorialen konflikt bei der gr ndung der nato der hie ostdeutschland
6373662 und wir haben westdeutschland deswegen nicht daran gehindert der nato beizutreten
6373663 schlie lich hat deutschland in der nato nicht nur seine teilung berwunden sondern auch durch demokratischen frieden seine sehr schwierige geschichte mit den nachbarn
6373664 wir m ssen uns an diese geschichte erinnern wenn wir ber die territorialen probleme georgiens reden

6373666 ich habe niemals geglaubt dass das argument georgien sei auch f r den map ungeeignet weil es ein territoriales problem gibt viel sinn macht

6373668 lack of access to cutting edge medical technology has significant consequences the most obvious is that a patients survival or return to full health is compromised because of a later or less sophisticated diagnosis and more invasive treatment
6373669 equally disconcerting is that canadas total healthcare expenditures are among the highest in the developed world and yet the limited inventory of advanced medical equipment found in our health care system is often old and outdated
6373670 the results of our failure to invest in new medical technologies are exemplified by long waiting times less efficient use of medical resources and less timely and sophisticated diagnosis and treatment
6373671 canadas failure to invest in the latest medical technology cannot be explained by a lack of money on the contrary canadas universal access health insurance program is among the developed worlds most expensive such programs
6373672 canadians desire access to modern and advanced medical technologies and they are already paying for that superior access so why is spending on new medical technologies so constrained in canada why are canadas relatively high levels of expenditures not purchasing the access to medical technology that one might expect

6373689 understandably pretty unhappy about the situation as the federal government vowed to buy up more of queenslands water for the environment
6373690 im from south australia and i understand what its like to live at this end of the river and as ive said those people who live downstream are understandably pretty unhappy about what happens upstream she said
6373691 the nature of the water system is that the further south you go the tougher people tend to be doing it right through until you reach the end of the system in south australia he said
6373692 the murray lakes and coorong wetlands cannot be allowed to die senator brown said
6373693 its not right that you have one part of the river system that is in virtual flood and the other part that is going to die he said
6373694 the fact is the lions share of water taken from the murray darling basin every year is taken by nsw victoria and south australia he said
6373695 understandably pretty unhappy about the situation as the federal government vowed to buy up more of queenslands water for the environment
6373696 this was a particularly tricky project as it required many system changes to occur in coordination with the guidewire claimcenter implementation
6373697 throughout this project hcl was responsive and adaptable to the various changes that occurred while remaining focused and productive additionally hcl has a sharp understanding of our business processes and technology environment which has offered us the added benefit of not disrupting our own staff during this important integration
6373698 with our deep experience in packaged implementations and our ongoing investment in building solution accelerators for low cost risk implementations we are in a unique position to offer insurance carriers the expertise needed to implement packaged solutions and assist in their business transformation initiatives
6373699 our implementation of claimcenter for njm is enabling the company to streamline and reduce risk in the claims transformation process and increase value to their customers
6373700 hcl resources have been involved with several implementations of guidewire claimcenter
6373701 their team has demonstrated a good understanding of our product and what it takes to make these mission critical enterprise projects successful
6373702 these data demonstrate unequivocal excellent efficacy mediated by krp 104 that is comparable to the marketed and late stage dpp 4 compounds and supports the dosing flexibility possible with krp 104 suggested in the studies
6373703 the good tolerability observed in this trial is well supported by our extensive preclinical experience including non human primates
6373704 we continue to be optimistic about the potential of krp 104
6373705 this phase iia trial clearly demonstrates the efficacy of krp 104 and we believe that our other studies differentiate krp 104 from the competition and support our position that krp 104 has best in class potential and is an attractive partnering candidate
6373706 while we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers he said
6373707 while i am pleased to make todays undertaking our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase
6373708 the recent fall in short term funding costs provides an opportunity to undertake to move rates in line with the rba decision but future interest rate decisions will need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors
6373709 all australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time
6373710 therefore any consideration that the federal government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates
6373711 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time she told an investor briefing
6373712 if lower short term money market rates are sustained and the reserve bank lowers the official cash rate there will be flow onto anzs variable rates an anz spokeswoman said this morning
6373713 our simulations show a benefit of two to three tenths over one lap and possibly more as the driver has the option to get on the power earlier as the car isnt upset by the gear change
6373714 the driver can be smoother with the acceleration so theres less disturbance when cornering and under power
6373715 we will see an advantage everywhere as you will always ratio the gearbox to get the most out of it at each circuit so its effect over a lap will be fairly consistent from circuit to circuit
6373716 we tested the gearbox for the first time at a shakedown at silverstone and then again for three days at jerez but for such an important component that really isnt enough to be able to validate it
6373717 running it on friday in hungary gave us the opportunity to conduct further testing plus we avoided the penalty of changing gearboxes in the middle of a four race cycle
6373718 with our limited resources the team have done a very good job to get it introduced this season
6373719 nortels r amp d and incubation teams are focused on creating revolutionary communications experiences to improve the way businesses interact with their employees partners and customers and web alive will be one very tangible example of that focus
6373720 people are no longer satisfied with existing collaboration tools or with static web sites supported only by a telephone contact center as the main point of interaction they want to discuss potential purchases with others exchange ideas make business proposals and fluidly interact with others in real time
6373721 additionally web alive will offer security not available with other virtual environments today because it is integrated with corporate enterprise systems and software
6373722 we have had rain 18 days so far this summer
6373723 i am definitely behind schedule but susan poulin props me up says im not as behind schedule as i say i am but i know better

6373734 this took a lot of hard work im very happy about this achievement and about how happy everyone is back home
6373735 i had a good start but then i had to go back because of the disqualification i knew throughout the race that i could better my position i made some strategic decisions and they paid off after the first buoy i could see it was possible and i went for it
6373736 you have no idea how excited we all are for you
6373737 ive been following your performance over the last couple of days and i admire your composure i can see you on television waving the flag i wish you the best of luck

6373745 i believe that its our destiny to win the gold both teams deserve to be in the final but i think we will be the ones who end up as the champions
6373746 were really confident but well just have to wait and see because argentina have the likes of messi aguero riquelme and mascherano in their squad and they will give us a hard match
6373747 but its not going to be easy for them we have some great individual players and the coach has moulded us into a team were working hard for one another and were getting to be more compact in our defence
6373748 we have only conceded three goals during this tournament and i think were getting better as a team with each game that we play for me our best performance was against belgium and our second best performance was against c te divoire in the quarter finals but we want to be at our peak for the final match and i believe that we will be
6373749 to know that the hard work before and during the competition has taken us to the final and a shot at the gold is incredible
6373750 to see the improvements weve made since our performance in our first game is absolutely wonderful we have really grown as a team during this tournament and now were going to beijing reaching the final was one of our objectives when we got here and now we have to make sure we win the gold

6373755 weve essentially put a dent now in the coatesville drug trade
6373756 its not going to be business as usual anymore so if people felt comfortable doing the drug dealing out in the open i dont think that they should feel that way from this point forward
6373757 this sends a message to the community that were on top of it
6373758 what we want to do is clear the streets so that the citizens can take control of the streets and so that we can once again ask our citizens to participate in the criminal justice system without fear
6373759 there was no pattern to it which made him hard to catch

6373768 canadian zinc believes that operating to the highest environmental standards is paramount to our future plans and as a company we have continually strived to both operate and plan for the future in an environmentally sensitive manner this has included working with and listening to the local communities in order to address their concerns we are very pleased that we have been able to plan for the future without the use of sodium cyanide such that the prairie creek mine will be able to operate in an environmentally responsible manner while providing a tremendous economic boost to the local area
6373769 we believe we should have been given more than what we actually got
6373770 were very surprised at their attitude because even before they left the country they knew they were entitled to 100 a day
6373771 we were even magnanimous enough to have paid them the money upfront and for three weeks the usual practice is for the athletes to be paid daily so as soon as they complete their event the allowance is stop
6373772 but it was in an effort to inspire them that we decided to pay them a lump sum covering more than the actual duration of the games
6373773 while the games ran for only 17 day we paid all our athletes 23 days this was done as a way of trying to motivate them the money might not be much but they should also realise that it is only what we receive from the government that we can give them

6373782 but that does not mean ill just go through the motions tomorrow it will be the same vigour and the intensity too would remain same im going for the gold
6373783 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen

6373785 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihren kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben

6373791 im going to do whatever it takes with an all out full effort to get sen barack obama elected president of the united states
6373792 other than sen clinton herself i was tremendously disappointed she was not the nominee
6373793 if she is enthusiastic about sen obama then all the clinton supporters should be enthusiastic about sen obama we all need to grow up and get ready for a historic general election and pull together as good democrats
6373794 it is also very important for the supporters of sen obama to extend their hand of friendship relationship and partnership and healing to make it that much easier
6373795 it is a way to motivate and activate people and get them ready for what basically is a bit of a sprint leading to election day
6373796 what i shared with them is sen obama will ultimately get a little extra effort from me in the general election because as much as i was 101 percent for clinton in the primary i was not against sen obama i was just for sen clinton in the general election i am for sen obama more than 101 percent and i am against sen john mccain so it is a heightened support
6373797 we are going to use the mayor to give speeches coordinate field efforts and probably do things outside of philly too he is very popular

6373812 but the last couple starts its hard to think they can give me any more opportunities than they have in this stretch especially with only a month and a half left in the season and the pennant race as close as it is now youve got to send guys out there that you believe are going to go out there and give you a win or give you six seven innings and i havent been doing that so i hate to say it was the right decision but i believe it was
6373813 mosport is one of the most challenging tracks there is because you have a lot of uphill and downhill blind corners and also some long straights overall the average speed is very high its very challenging at mosport for every sports car driver
6373814 its always great to go to a different country for a race thats number one the canadian people are wonderful people theyre happy theyre knowledgeable about racing and just from a driving standpoint the track is awesome because it is so fast its got some very challenging places turn 2 is really challenging even turn 1 and as a race car driver youre interested in going fast and there probably isnt a better track for that
6373815 its a quick really really fast track and the atmosphere at that track is awesome too you get really good racing i think it suits itself to the prototype cars and at the end of the day those cars like to be driven fast so well be real excited to go back there
6373816 i think the fans at mosport are really passionate about their motorsport they know what is going on in our series and what they can expect is the great season long battle that we have in the lmp2 class and the gt2 class and in all the other respective categories they know whats going on and its always a treat to go up there because they respect and honor their one chance to get up close and personal with the cars and drivers for the season as its the only time we visit canada
6373817 its like the worlds fastest rollercoaster except youre in control i just love it i cant wait to get there i wish we would go there 12 times a year its just tremendous the fans are fantastic this year they are going to be starved for their motorsport a little bit its going to be fun to be able to entertain them and i think we will put on a good show im sure well have a lot of new fans coming along to add to the ones we already have its just spectacular to watch and to drive
6373818 the canadian fans in mosport definitely have something different about them last year we had a great run we finished fourth in class so that was really nice for us so were looking forward it suits our car and we look forward to going there again
6373819 its the most challenging track i know if you are scared please dont go there mosport is all about turn in speed but with very quick and blind corners this is not so easy you need to build up your personal limit from below otherwise your car is missing some parts there is not one corner to pick up but for sure one of the most important ones is the hairpin followed by a long uphill straight here you need to have a very good traction
6373820 last year was my first time and its a really difficult track very fast and i can tell you it was one of the hardest races for me last year its weird because a lot of people come to see the race and that makes the race more interesting i think this year is going to be even better hopefully so well try to win this year again
6373821 we are extremely delighted to add scott to our driver lineup for petit le mans

6373836 my message will be the same as when i was asked why am i supporting obama
6373837 by comparing the two candidates my conclusion was the policies obama will enact will be the result of a considered and intelligent process
6373838 and i hadnt envisioned being a speaker until about a month ago
6373839 i feel honored that they would want to hear an alaskan perspective on reform needed in government and an alaskan perspective on prosperity for our nation

6373841 make sure courage guides your sword hand not your fear

6373846 the underwriting result is the main source of the beat with good levels of reserve releases

6373849 the public is sick of woefully inadequate and ineffective services
6373850 this will ensure that it is the public that is shaping our bus services
6373851 there needs to be tighter control of bus services to ensure that passengers get the services they deserve
6373852 if bus companies want to operate services they will have to offer a full service not just cherry pick the most profitable routes and times
6373853 we must take into account the social need for services where they may not be profitable and ensure that people do not become isolated within their communities
6373854 make sure courage guides your sword hand not your fear
6373855 make sure you die on your feet and not cowering behind some fetid corpse
6373856 yeah but will it be in a bag or on a pair of valkyrie wings
6373857 as executor of the will of the aesir i will destroy you
6373858 did you toast to me when i lay upon a marble slab in hell
6373859 nat rlich wird dies auch die milit rische kooperation betreffen
6373860 ich will nicht anma end klingen aber es gab einen gro en territorialen konflikt bei der gr ndung der nato der hie ost deutschland
6373861 und wir haben westdeutschland deswegen nicht daran gehindert der nato beizutreten
6373862 schlie lich hat deutschland in der nato nicht nur seine teilung berwunden sondern auch durch demokratischen frieden seine sehr schwierige geschichte mit den nachbarn
6373863 wir m ssen uns an diese geschichte erinnern wenn wir ber die territorialen probleme georgiens reden
6373864 georgien wird wenn es das will mitglied der nato werden
6373865 ich habe niemals geglaubt dass das argument georgien sei auch f r den map ungeeignet weil es ein territoriales problem gibt viel sinn macht
6373866 serdar tasci hat all das umgesetzt was wir von ihm erwartet haben
6373867 f r das erste l nderspiel hat er seine sache wirklich gut gemacht

6373869 wenn er auf dem niveau weiter spielt wird er noch viele l nderspiele machen
6373870 ich bin froh dass es jetzt geklappt hat die null muss stehen das haben wir geschafft

6374017 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6374018 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6374019 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet
6374020 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6374021 one line of inquiry officers are investigating is that the boy may have been chased prior to the fall
6374022 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats

6374028 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone

6374033 well be pressing on the pakistanis themselves to be involved with us in fighting terrorism and making sure the number of terrorists coming into afghanistan from pakistan is limited
6374034 obviously we have had a period of political uncertainty in pakistan i think its very important now that we see the pakistan and afghan governments working together
6374035 we have obviously also suffered casualties because of the summer offensive
6374036 we have always expected there to be a summer offensive because of the fact that there was very little of a spring offensive
6374037 its a summer offensive of the taliban we will see that happening but in our view our strategy will be to build up the afghan army to build up the rest of afghan society
6374038 sort out the government so that we have a full attack on corruption
6374039 we want to see on the ground the delivery of results

6374052 london retailers continue to outperform their uk counterparts buoyed in july by tourists discounts and the central london economy holding up better than the rest of the country
6374053 but factors affecting other parts of the uk such as falling house prices and the squeeze on incomes are starting to impact on the capital hitting sales of more expensive house related goods
6374054 central london has once again outperformed the rest of the uk but by a lower margin that we have seen in the previous two months

6374062 we have to recognise that if it hadnt been for defender carles puyol and goalkeeper iker casillas we would have conceded at least one goal but the players confidence and skill allowed us to overcome the poor start and win the game
6374063 weve got two world cup qualifiers coming up and we have to get things right because we cant afford to make any mistakes we are the favourites to win but we cant slip up especially when we play at home
6374064 this system worked at the european championship with the players we have in the team we need to keep playing the same way and it worked against denmark especially in the second half
6374065 there are a lot of young players in this team and we havent fulfilled our potential yet

6374090 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres
6374091 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6374092 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6374093 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance

6374115 i learned that if you do a little bit of work ahead of time you can do so much better in an emergency
6374116 she really pioneered the teaching of cpr to our residents with very little support
6374117 we kept track of the impact of her training along with actual cardiac arrests in the hospital and over time she demonstrated that survival rates were getting better
6374118 it takes a lot of individuals and resources to bring simulation in the training of doctors
6374119 if we put our heads together we can develop new modules and then evaluate their effectiveness in learning
6374120 it became very frustrating because this was happening too frequently
6374121 i started to interview people and collect data on resuscitation and i saw that we were asking too much from the first responders
6374122 instead of administering basic cpr they would prepare the room for advanced life support like getting the epinephrine and the defibrillator ready
6374123 this critical gap for all simulation research is the challenge to relate what happens in simulations to what happens in real situations
6374124 if providers learn and do well with simulated patients does that really mean better outcomes for actual patients
6374125 once students make mistakes they have less of a chance making them the second time around which may include real patients

6374129 i think that the tension is more problematic and severe
6374130 the crm issue is in the mobile space we are abandoning the mobile space and putting it on the back burner
6374131 the next generation of computing takes us into this wave of thinking
6374132 to be competitive they will have to get beyond a subset of a browser to a full personal computer system this is where apple has rewritten the rules of mobile when it comes to computing
6374133 not only is it an important tool to gain and access but also as a medium for advertising
6374134 we have to stop talking like we are doing something to the customer and start talking about what we are doing with the customer
6374135 whats the customer advantage now and whats the competitive advantage for yourself
6374136 part of the issue has to do with having the right technology in place to do the customer experience ive gone through multiple experiences where companies bet on the wrong technology and spend millions on the wrong thing and it blew up in their faces
6374137 ultimately hes right you still have to have a step in determining what technology delivers the best customer experience
6374138 what we are talking about here is especially true in crm technology in general is the vehicle to deliver experiences there is a weight and shift towards the way people will communicate work and learn and its all based on digital architecture
6374139 its all focused around not only the delivery but the interaction

6374190 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6374191 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6374192 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6374193 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6374194 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6374195 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6374196 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6374197 you know that you are on the front line in the fight against the taliban you know that by what you are doing here you prevent terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6374198 as a result of the talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6374199 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members
6374200 this does not affect the industrial action for the scanner workers who are employed by airport services
6374201 sadly some unscrupulous traders have taken advantage of the distinction between solicited and unsolicited calls duping or pressuring customers into buying products without the chance to change their minds
6374202 they turned up at 10 30am and i had to tell my 17 staff they didnt have a job i just cant believe it im in complete shock
6374203 they have told me i need to pay a deposit of 10 000 and pay rent of 2 500 per week to keep the pub going
6374204 im in no financial position to do that no wonder cains went into administration if thats the amount of rent they were paying
6374205 the rent is ridiculously high after utility bills staff salaries and so on i would go bankrupt in a matter of months
6374206 theyve already had a guy looking to buy the tenancy out from under me but i live above the pub this pub is my life ill not only be losing my job but my home and my dignity
6374207 they took all the real ales out and put in cains and i lost all my regulars ive recently put moorhouses pendle witches brew back on and ive had my regulars back in
6374208 i have people from canada and australia who come here specially for the fish and chips and the real ale i could turn this pub around if they gave me half a chance but punch are not willing to compromise
6374209 its a crying shame they used to have an annual beer festival they have so many historical connections with the canal network
6374210 lets hope when all the dust settles with cains the blood tub will be back up and running
6374211 punch is aware that all of the staff at the pub including the manager have been made redundant by cains pub company as a consequence of the administration
6374212 although the situation is unfortunate these staff have at no stage been employed by punch taverns
6374213 punch taverns offered the lease to the current manager of the pub who opted against taking this agreement

6374244 what you are doing is part of an incredibly important process of creating not only a terrorist free afghanistan but an afghanistan where there will be democracy and people will have a stake in the future for the long term
6374245 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6374246 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication

6374253 lerta was used by the county department of community development to successfully attract industries to the industrial park along colonial manor road in the township
6374254 i know space is limited but i dont feel we need to rush into renovation of the administration building i knew the district projects extra money but why spend
6374255 it would cost each member about 250 a month out of pocket
6374256 i cant see us agreeing to pay just to see ourselves on television
6374257 yes its a clock no your mom cant read it
6374258 ok some moms can read it the kind with degrees in computer science our bad
6374259 we bring you the revenue from your outstanding receivables and make that available to the district immediately

6374262 it was an animal path that became a major indian trail
6374263 it was used for communications between villages for hunting for trading and for diplomacy
6374264 trinity lutheran held its first services in a log church very close to where the marker will stand
6374265 the land along those indian paths was prime commercial real estate
6374266 they were often the first areas to see population growth and development
6374267 what i like about the marker program is that markers raise historical awareness in the region history is not just something that happened in philadelphia or boston
6374268 i think the markers are especially important in smaller towns where local people often dont realize that something of national significance happened here
6374269 residents realize that a local person someone from their home town did something great
6374270 the markers are educational for travelers passing through who can learn something about the history of pennsylvania but they are more meaningful for local folks who can take pride in their history
6374271 weve had so much change its mind boggling but its a chance to grow and get a different point of view
6374272 what id like to say to parents is calm down let it happen and be a part of it kids are much more resilient than parents think i think they will be excited about the changes
6374273 i think the numbers are growing to larger than the district thought they would especially in the younger grades where you want smaller classes for fundamentals
6374274 theyre eager to help and were eager to have them help
6374275 they have a different kind of knowledge and kids have a different kind of respect for them
6374276 parents trust us with their children and parents trust us to correct their children we can call parents on their cell phones and kids dont want us to do that
6374277 this initiative also enhances community relations between service providers teachers and counselors
6374278 to have all of the talent of the entire district in our building thats rich
6374279 i believe were in a position to provide the best to our students
6374280 many are hoping for change but based on experience are hesitant to believe i understand its hard to believe people can change a school district
6374281 i cant do it by myself thats why we put together the best leadership staff this district has ever seen
6374282 one door closed for me making the olympic team and another door opened
6374283 im still in her corner but from a different perspective
6374284 it doesnt really make a difference if swin was never to win a game again she could honestly say she is blessed
6374285 the end result will hopefully be a place where she can come down and run basketball camps
6374286 shes a great articulate young lady and knows the game and played in the olympics
6374287 the experience and the friendships that i made thats what i miss
6374288 if anything not making this team and having to report it has made me hungrier and more focused to be playing
6374289 i just feel to round everything out i need my second gold medal

6374302 interpretare la poesia del mito come biografia storia o scienza significa distruggerla un simile infortunio senza dubbio occorso alla bibbia e a gran parte del culto cristiano
6374303 negli stati uniti c una forma di fanatismo per la ricerca del s autentico in se stessi e negli altri
6374304 una delle molte dolenti anomalie degli stati uniti di oggi che tanta gente ossessionata dalla bibbia pur non avendola mai letta
6374305 a noi non interessa in modo particolare sapere se rip van winkle kamar al zaman o ges cristo sono realmente esistiti quelle che ci interessano sono le loro storie e queste storie sono cos ampiamente distribuite nel mondo ogni paese ha i suoi eroi che il sapere se questo o quel portatore locale del tema universale sia realmente esistito o meno diventa per noi di secondaria importanza linsistere su questo elemento storico porterebbe ad una confusione e riuscirebbe solo ad offuscare il messaggio dellimmagine
6374306 le religioni le filosofie le arti le forme sociali delluomo primitivo e storico le scoperte scientifiche e tecniche gli stessi sogni che popolano il sonno scaturiscono indistintamente dalla fonte magica del mito

6374310 in china haben wir uns an zweistellige wachstumsraten im inlandsgesch ft gew hnt dieses jahr wird es hingegen nur noch ein einstelliges wachstum sein
6374311 die vielzahl der tarife und sonderaktionen sorgt nicht zwangsl ufig f r mehr wechselbereitschaft beim kunden viele kunden bleiben lieber ihrem anbieter treu als sich mit dem tarifwirrwarr auseinanderzusetzen
6374312 da helfen auch die t glichen call center attacken der anbieter nicht weiter um den kunden mit halbseidenen angeboten zu berrumpeln und ihm teure vertr ge aufzuschwatzen das f hrt im endergebnis noch zu einer h heren ver rgerung der verbraucher
6374313 die praxis zeigt dass es vielen tk unternehmen nicht gelingt ihren werbespr chen gerecht zu werden sie schlagen sich anscheinend lieber in ihren kundendienst abteilungen mit den auswirkungen und symptomen schlecht konzipierter produkte und services herum und bet tigen sich in der brandbek mpfung ohne die ursachen wirklich zu beheben
6374314 besonders bei den festnetzanbietern bekommt man zuweilen den eindruck dass sie alles tun um m glichst viele servicevorf lle zu generieren
6374315 all das f hrt schnell zu kundenfrust mitarbeiter sind oftmals nicht in der lage ein problem am telefon zu l sen da sie lediglich f r einfache ausk nfte die so genannten faqs geschult sind und ber keine oder geringe vollmachten verf gen um ein kundenanliegen schnell und unb rokratisch zu l sen
6374316 diese mehrfach kontakte werden dann zum echten problem wenn anfragen ber unterschiedliche eingangskan le nicht einem vorgang zugeordnet werden k nnen diese f higkeit besitzen leider die wenigsten unternehmen zudem gibt es oftmals keine ad quate m glichkeit einfache vorg nge schnell selbst zu erledigen wer es gewohnt ist seine fl ge online zu buchen den telefonischen quick check in bevorzugt und sitzplatzreservieren per sms liebt der hat wenig spa bei den meisten angeboten der telefonfirmen zur selbstadministration per telefon oder im internet

6374328 to tell a kid you cant have a cell phone in this day and age is almost ridiculous but what were asking is that they dont have them on mostly because of text messaging
6374329 ill bet we had maybe two or three last year thats a pretty low number
6374330 were stressing that under safety initiatives here that while cell phones are a convenience we ask that parents dont call your child in school
6374331 and cell phones can be a homing device so if there were god forbid a terrorist situation we want the phones off
6374332 but ill be the first one to tell you because i have kids and they have cell phones that it isnt easy
6374333 they electronics are not permitted none whatsoever in the building
6374334 i know the kids carry them and its the 21st century here but this is still a school
6374335 we encourage students to lock things up in their lockers and they are encouraged to bring their own personal locks to gym class
6374336 any time you have electronic devices in school there could be an increase in theft
6374337 the bigger problem is they do take videos weve had kids take pictures of something going on at school and they post them on youtube
6374338 not that youre trying to kid anyone that things dont happen you just dont want that stuff out there on the internet
6374339 there is evidence that the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine does wear off after time weve seen cases of whooping cough in teens and adults
6374340 the additional doses are on top of the initial dose that you get when you are younger before you start school
6374341 they have to make that declaration and it has to be on the record and in the students file
6374342 the student who is not vaccinated is at increased risk of getting a disease but it poses no threat to the other students because the number is so small
6374343 creating new jobs is great for the local community here in reading and my business will be recruiting around 160 local people to fulfil the roles generated by this growth

6374358 broadband on the move is bringing about a change in consumer behaviour
6374359 consumers can now do the things they would normally do at home when they are out and about
6374360 the days of the internet being something for the home are over for a growing number of savvy shoppers the online and in store worlds have now merged retailers should take advantage of the fact that customers may now have access to the internet whilst in store and for example use their wifi connections to deliver expert advice via a store intranet channel
6374361 la pol tica del gobierno nacional continuar seguir redistribuyendo este recurso idh al pueblo boliviano y a sus instituciones eso es lo que piden los distintos sectores y regiones del pa s
6374362 la gente que tiene plata convoca a un paro y obliga a los pobres a que paren sus comercios su trabajo pero los comercios e industrias de los platudos no pararon
6374363 en tema del idh el gobierno nunca ha cerrado el di logo pero busquemos un nuevo pacto fiscal que de esa lucha los sectores sociales se beneficien todas las instituciones y regiones del pa s

6374365 hay personas que van agrediendo atacando que van realizando acciones totalmente injustas entonces siento que es una forma de no respeto a la poblaci n hablan de tomar instituciones eso es pr cticamente un golpe civil al estado boliviano
6374366 es clara la provocaci n de ese tipo de medida impulsada por prefectos como el cruce o rub n costas o el acaudalado empresario branko marinkovic que s lo buscan sembrar m s violencia
6374367 lo nico que queremos es terminar con el estado unitario que es justamente por lo que est peleando el gobierno y eso es la raz n por la cual choca contra la autonom a
6374368 lo que ahora estamos pidiendo es una reuni n con los ministros de salud de justicia de hacienda y el viceministerio de coordinaci n con los movimientos sociales para formar parte de la reglamentaci n de la ley aprobada
6374369 por la votaci n que logr nuestro presidente en el referendo revocatorio en la ciudad de el alto con m s del 80 por ciento de apoyo de la poblaci n de esa ciudad se deduce que el pr ximo prefecto debe ser un ciudadano alte o comprometido con los cambios
6374370 en los primeros meses podemos efectivamente fue propositivo cumplimos un rol de oposici n caso de la firma de los contratos petroleros pero luego se radicaliz y podemos se convirti en un instrumento m s de los conflictos que se desataron entre los departamentos de la media luna y el gobierno
6374371 costas al ser adulto cronol gico y biol gico tiene una autoestima baja y a su edad no puede ser muy alta eso se traduce en un discurso agresivo que es un mecanismo de defensa para camuflar su baja autoestima y su inmadurez emocional
6374372 lo que se busca es la confrontaci n entre bolivianos y esto no genera ning n r dito favorable a las regiones que entraron en el paro c vico por imposici n de sus prefectos y comit s c vicos
6374373 camaradas s siento y comparto la rabia contenida que albergan sus corazones por los hechos ocurridos en los ltimos tiempos contra la instituci n policial quiero decirles con toda firmeza y sin dudar que no permitiremos m s ultrajes a nuestra instituci n del orden y mucho menos el atropello a la investidura de nuestras autoridades y efectivos policiales
6374374 detr s de todo esto hay una estrategia orientada para tener ocupado al gobierno en una serie de demandas que le impiden llevar adelante su plan de reformas y sus pol ticas de gesti n

6374407 iowaska in brazil it was nuts man its like a vine that they boil all three phases of the psychedelic trip powerful stuff man
6374408 today is iowaska day for me and i wake up with my mind rushing of thoughts of what this drug is going to do to me this drug a tree vine has changed peoples lives for the better i was greeted by a guy dressed as a tree yep thats right a grown man dressed as a tree shouting nonsense at me and blew this stuff up my nose then bang off i went into another world
6374409 so did you get to try any iowaska in brazil
6374410 all of a sudden youre gonna have this massive great hook in your ear

6374412 a british resident being held in guant namo bay today won his high court bid to force british security services to reveal secret information on him
6374413 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart
6374414 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge
6374415 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6374416 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded
6374417 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work

6374420 with more time and increased number of photos we can start to identify individual cats look at which cameras they show up on to get an idea of range and possible range overlap with the smaller cats

6374436 i wanted alaskans to have a firsthand opportunity to learn the facts of this matter

6374441 vivo como si fuera un recluso nadie sabe quien soy
6374442 well i dont know how much time it is going to be
6374443 it is an injury similar to the one that linebacker cato june had last year this is one strange bird ive said that about wide receiver joey galloway but knowing davin he is the kind of guy that might take the boot off and play im not going to discount him playing in the opener or in the third week of the season im just going to say that right now he will not play against jacksonville there is a chance that he might not be ready for a couple of weeks but well just keep updating you week in and week out and see how davin does
6374444 hes not depressed by it or anything like that hes ready to get back to work once hes done with rehab
6374445 when i came here i knew i was going to play several positions but some days more guard reps than center and some days more center reps than guard i just do whatever they tell me to do
6374446 the coaching staff hasnt told me anything yet i came out to practice and they told me to play right guard that was it
6374447 the coaches said you just have to be ready for your chance because you never know when its going to come and if youre not ready for that opportunity when it comes it might never come again
6374448 its not opening day yet so im just trying to get better each day
6374449 hopefully by the time opening day comes ill be ready im just trying to get ready for tomorrow im taking it one day at a time
6374450 as a rookie one of the biggest problems is how fast the game moves
6374451 its happening that way because you dont know exactly whats going on along the defensive line or you dont know 100 percent of what youre doing if you know what youre doing then the game will slow down for you that only comes with experience
6374452 davin and i have our own calls that we made up ourselves that way no one else will know them
6374453 honestly we have stuff like that we dont really talk during the games that much anyways we know what each other is going to do davin is one hell of a player jeff faine will tell you that davin knows whats going on before the play even happens he helps you out as much as possible
6374454 z zuttah is doing great you can obviously tell that hes come a long way since otas he knows what hes doing and has learned the playbook fast which is impressive he has all of the physical tools so i expect him to do well
6374455 hes been coming out here and working his tail off each day and preparing and staying focused if he keeps preparing that way hell be just fine
6374456 will it be seamless obviously not there will be some growing involved in it
6374457 should it be detrimental to our ability to effectively play absolutely not
6374458 were working on our rotations at this point in time
6374459 zuttah hes just shown us that he is a quick study he is a guy that we think has the range to be an interior player whether it be a left guard right guard or center obviously there will be some growing pains im not going to say he is going to be the right guard im just saying he is a candidate but we do like our young offensive guard from rutgers
6374460 nobody has announced the starting lineup for the new orleans saints game if you look at our preseason games each week one of those two men buenning and zuttah has been featured at guard and or center it was jeremys week to be the center last week and its his week to be the guard this week i think youd be premature to read anything into it at this time
6374461 i cant imagine getting much more intense to be honest with you
6374462 jeff garcia looked much better today and joey galloway looked better today i dont know eithers availability until actually we kick this thing off on saturday

6374556 pour les s ries cela ne devrait pas tre un gros probl me mais sil ny a pas dam lioration cela aura certainement une influence
6374557 une la jambe et lautre au pied l o le tendon dachille rencontre los
6374558 concernait son pied mais nous ne savons pas quand il sest bless il en souffrait depuis six ou sept ans d j m me avant les jeux dath nes en 2004
6374559 samedi il a eu un probl me apr s le traitement les docteurs nont pas r alis que c tait aussi s rieux et pensaient quil sentra nerait sans probl me aujourdhui personne ne savait quil ne pourrait pas concourir aujourdhui
6374560 je tavais bien dit que jaurais une m daille mais personne ne me croyait
6374561 il sait ce quil veut et o il va embraye son agent rachid esmouni cest quelquun qui vit dans sa bulle et qui naime pas en sortir un peu comme manaudou cest la raison pour laquelle il para t introverti mais cest juste quil naime pas d ranger
6374562 on est dans un monde de doutes reconna t son entra neur je ne peux rien y faire tout ce que je peux dire cest quil valait beaucoup mieux que ses 814 22 son ancien record personnel d sormais port 810 49 il donne son sang et son urine quand les pr leveurs le lui demandent il a pass tous les contr les et il ny a aucun probl me les gens peuvent toujours parler lui il prouvera le contraire sur le terrain
6374563 il fallait ne pas se faire pi ger je me suis dit quil fallait surtout ne pas me faire sortir comme ath nes jai fait beaucoup de fautes mais javais les cannes jesp re que jaurais les m mes demain je sens que je monte en puissance
6374564 51 a t rep ch parmi les quatre qualifi s au temps avec le 16e et dernier chrono
6374565 si je marrache demain la finale est faisable maintenant ce nest que du bonus
6374566 nous avons deux semaines avant la fin de la p riode des transferts et je pense que ce seront les plus importantes jai lu qualex ferguson voulait un nouvel attaquant et jesp re quil sagit de berbatov
6374567 franchement j tais vraiment vraiment vraiment fatigu je navais vraiment plus rien jai d croch au train cest lorgueil qui la fait remonter de quelques places ndlr je navais vraiment plus rien jai rattrap un deux trois coureurs mais c tait trop juste
6374568 je me suis fait d border un peu trop et je nai pas embray assez rapidement cest difficile car cest un grand championnat il y avait trois courses et ce nest pas toujours le meilleur qui gagne mais celui qui r cup re le mieux
6374569 je my tais pr par normalement a aurait d passer mais jai re u un gros coup de chaud au 5e kilom tre ndrl de la course pied cest clair que a ma certainement handicap mais normalement j tais pr t pour cette chaleur apparemment peut tre pas assez
6374570 jai fait la course de ma vie apr s une longue attente je vois enfin le bout du tunnel
6374571 au 5e kilom tre jai compris que ce serait un grand jour pour moi quand on sest retrouv trois sur la fin je savais que la m daille tait assur e mais je voulais d crocher lor je me r p tais sans cesse que ce moment tait celui dont javais r v toute ma vie
6374572 ce match a t p nible jouer p nible manager p nible arbitrer et s rement p nible regarder
6374573 je crois que le minimum quon pouvait obtenir tait un nul on m ritait ce nul on ne m ritait certainement pas la d faite mais cest comme a jesp re que nous serons dans le m me cas que paris que nous gagnerons des matches sans lavoir m rit dans le jeu
6374574 je comprends quil puisse dire a il aurait m me pu dire que bordeaux m ritait la victoire
6374575 paris a t tr s r aliste au contraire de bordeaux je ne pense pas quils m ritent leur victoire mais la r alit est que paris a pris trois points et bordeaux z ro
6374576 je suis satisfait du jeu produit m me sil y a des choses am liorer je dirais quil a manqu un peu de percussion offensive m me si je pense quon est devant paris aux nombres de situations dangereuses devant le but cest bien beau davoir la ma trise du ballon mais il faut que a se concr tise au tableau daffichage et cela na pas t le cas
6374577 on doit tre d u du r sultat mais la d faite nest pas si grave on a perdu contre une quipe qui n tait pas meilleure que nous il arrivera dans la saison que lon soit battu par plus fort que nous mais l ce n tait pas le cas on verra par la suite si cette d faite tait inqui tante comme on dit toujours il ne faut pas shabituer la d faite
6374578 il faut certainement jouer plus simple cest la chose la plus compliqu e dans le football si on conserve cette ma trise et quon arrive simplifier notre jeu on gagnera plus de matches quon en perdra

6374730 i trained on that one table its where the bosses in my dads work unit play i found some european players who were on break to play with me
6374731 to get to the final eight in the olympics it really wasnt easy
6374732 to win this game i really put forth my biggest effort
6374733 representing the u s its much more relaxed its not like china where you have to win the gold its a different mentality
6374734 the mentality is we do the best we can theres no pressure
6374735 for so many people to be cheering for me i felt like i was still a chinese athlete everyone was pulling for me they were all speaking chinese
6374736 at one point one girl shouted really loud and it made me mess up my shot
6374737 in such a big competition theres no way to say whos going to win or lose it just depends on how you play
6374738 thats not something anybody can do hes a special type player
6374739 ben has worked extremely hard and i think hes about what we anticipated he would be
6374740 hes a guy who can move the chain with the run game
6374741 when i was at tennessee i was sharing a lot of reps with bo i was the run blocker and he was the pass catcher here im able to just go in and be more of a complete player where im asked to do everything
6374742 i think the coaches obviously know if the ball is thrown to me im going to be able to make the catch
6374743 his strengths are his run blocking but he also can catch the ball its not just that hes a glorified offensive tackle
6374744 anytime a guy goes back and plays against a team where he played from start to finish there is some emotion associated with it
6374745 hes a very very mature veteran hell stay focused and hell deal with it hes part of this team and hell be concerned with nothing but making sure he can help contribute to our offense
6374746 he has great hands knows how to use his body
6374747 the funny part about it i like seeing him after practice when hes in the locker room maintaining his body taking care of his body thats good because it shows the expectations he wants to have of this team
6374748 i gave those fans everything i had and i still live in atlanta in the offseason

6374818 it ought to be obvious to anyone with a modicum of common sense that the model of school we all know so well the model in which students come to school as essentially empty vessels waiting to be filled by the teacher is hopelessly flawed and outdated in this day and age
6374819 if you want to understand the effects of the ludicrous examination systems we have been smothered by for so long just read the comments
6374820 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6374821 on take off pilots reach a point of no return known as v1 speed which is usually reached about two seconds before take off
6374822 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6374823 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6374824 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6374825 im very aware of the effect that the announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone

6374846 i think michael jordan is the best athlete in the world not only for how he played the game but for all he did to grow the sport of basketball
6374847 what he achieved no other human has or in my opinion will its hard enough surviving cancer but winning seven tour de france titles after that is amazing
6374848 has the ability to drown out all distraction and focus in on the moment i feel like i am in a similar situation in swimming since swimming is an individual sport how you perform can impact only you
6374849 jackie joyner kersee is the perfect athlete because she dedicates every day of her life to perfecting herself
6374850 its not so she can be the greatest athlete for her own selfish reasons but so she can deliver hope to a younger generation
6374851 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6374852 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6374853 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6374854 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6374855 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6374856 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation

6374867 its amazing how many times youre casually in the sun without realizing it all the freckles and leathery skin thats a result of cumulative sun damage amp sun exposure there are a lot of golfers tennis players gardeners and whole lot of other people that simply wont use a topical for whatever reason which makes the sunpill a timely option for year round protection
6374868 persons who suffer from this unexplained skin condition report a range of cutaneous skin symptoms including crawling biting and stinging sensations granules threads fibers or black speck like materials on or beneath the skin and or skin lesions e g rashes or sores in addition to skin manifestations some sufferers also report fatigue mental confusion short term memory loss joint pain and changes in visions
6374869 to learn more about who may be affected with this condition the symptoms they experience and to look for clues about factors that might contribute to the condition
6374870 we are aware that many patients have suffered from this condition and i can tell you that here at cdc we have really been seeing an increasing number of these reports over the past year or so
6374871 all morgellons patients screened to date have tested positive for the presence of agrobacterium whereas this microorganism has not been detected in any of the samples derived from the control healthy individuals
6374872 agrobacterium may be involved in the etiology and or progression
6374873 theres almost always some history of exposure to dirt basically either from gardening or camping or something
6374874 release of these plants may also result in release of the
6374875 very few authors actually test to ensure that the antibiotics succeed
6374876 here is where the possibility of gene escape arises the presence of the disarmed agrobacterium in the tissue would not be a problem if the binary vector had been lost but now its survival and spread are real possibilities
6374877 the opportunistic and systemically moving agrobacterium vector infectious to a wide host range might eventually cause infection and damage to crop plants or natural vegetation
6374878 not presently visited by the traditional vectors of the virus disease
6374879 future research has to show whether agrobacterium mediated transformation contributed to horizontal gene transfer between microorganisms in the rhizosphere
6374880 have a ready route for horizontal gene escape via agrobacterium helped by the ordinary conjugative mechanisms of many other bacteria that cause diseases which are present in the environment

6375109 it was completely a different type of performance that physically disabled children have presented its unbelievable that they had been able to perform in such a wonderful way it was a beautiful performance
6375110 it was a wonderful performance all the artistes they are so incredible that you cant say anything we dont have words to say about them but they really bring so much of emotions out of us that we really should take care of the freedom we have received just in heritage
6375111 i feel that these disabled children seek more freedom as out country has not been disabled friendly so they should be provided that type of freedom they have not been given opportunities and freedom in education and employment for that they want freedom they are enthusiastic to do something in life they have given such a wonderful performance to prove they also have a right to live in the society they seek their dignity and equality in the society they are keen to take part in the independence day celebrations

6375132 brits are simply not proactive or spontaneous during their bank holidays preferring to lounge around the house and catch up with some rest
6375133 there is still a growing debate around adding an extra bank holiday to the calendar particularly one that celebrates a shared identity or sense of britishness
6375134 but for this to work people need to get off the sofa and get involved much like our overseas counterparts who often celebrate national days with fiestas and carnivals
6375135 today it seems that bank holidays lack any real meaning beyond having a day off work
6375136 the challenge in adding an extra bank holiday is to find a day that celebrates national identity in an increasingly multicultural britain
6375137 the smart money has to be on remembrance day in order to space out bank holidays more evenly but more importantly it is a day on which everyone can reflect no matter what their background is
6375138 it is worth noting that this growth is entirely driven by new stores and new shoppers spend levels for existing shoppers remain unchanged and quite low compared with the top four typical monthly spend per household is 45 for aldi compared with 126 for tesco
6375139 until 1986 the vast majority of candidates both democrats and republicans joined the public funding program wisconsin had one of the best programs in the nation however by halting spending limit increases in 1986 the legislature made it increasingly difficult for those accepting public funding to compete
6375140 it may not be easy but wisconsin was once a leader on this vital and increasingly important issue of public campaign financing it can be a leader again

6375146 although political spending is going up the legislature has neglected its once successful public financing law this law no longer achieves its goals it doesnt limit spending and most candidates dont take the program seriously
6375147 he has some quite considerable time left on the contract hes been brilliant when we signed him from watford we paid a lot of money for him but we didnt pay a lot of money to him
6375148 he was a young kid and he was happy to do it i had seen enough of him to know that he would come through
6375149 he took a bit of time to settle started off quite brightly and then went into a bit of a lull then he started to find it at the back end of last season again and then carried it right through the summer and its gone on
6375150 it was still a lot of money to pay for him but at the end of the day he might be worth three times that now

6375155 the second quarter delivered many positives europe generated improved operating results and the united states made significant inroads we maintained financial discipline in our operating units and we continued to develop our global opportunities
6375156 progress continued toward advancing our european distribution network as we purchased the remaining 49 of altra trading gmbh through which we hold our european operations we are confident this purchase will enable us to efficiently manage our european operations europe is an important market for shamir and we are committed to increasing our footprint in this geography and will continue to make appropriate investments in leadership marketing and sales
6375157 in terms of our overall strategy we continue to invest for long term growth while closely monitoring operational expenses our positive performance thus far this year combined with our commitment to growth and operations position us to achieve the goals we have set forth for shamir based on our results through the first six month of 2008 we reconfirm our previously announced forecasts of estimate for growth in the range of 10 16 based on the december 2007 exchange rates and excluding the results of our mexican operation
6375158 these numbers reflect the strength of our business model at a very difficult time for the industry even though many banks would be more than pleased with a 57 percent profit growth in the first half of a year like 2008 we actually wanted even better results
6375159 business development has been a little slower than expected and we are not yet where we want to be in terms of efficiency in our execution and processes we are taking decisive action to ensure that this continues to evolve over the coming 12 months our new top management appointments are a testament to our commitment to this plan
6375160 the challenge for saxo bank today is to optimize our global operation we will continue to improve cost efficiency and execution to stay ahead of the game moreover globalization is changing the market place at a rapid pace that we intend to at least match we are delighted to have eric rylberg and karsten poulsen on board to help us achieve our ambitious goals
6375161 in 2008 markets have shown quite unusual behavior and earnings volatility has been above average at saxo bank we have so far coped well with this and our focus on streamlining the business should make us even better prepared for the longer term also with our multi product trading platform we have been able to increase cfd options and futures trading which works to our benefit turbulent markets offer investment opportunities but we still urge our clients to be diligent and careful when investing and also to make good use of our support functions

6375171 the merger of the two provinces as i have pointed out through these columns earlier was not for the benefit of the tamils either of the north or the east but to meet indias security needs getting hold of trincomalee which is strategically important for india by paving for a de facto satellite enclave comprising the north and the east whose leaders would take the cue not from colombo but from new delhi or chennai that was amply demonstrated during vartharaja perumals short stint as chief minister colombo did not know even his movements across the palk strait to india

6375185 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
6375186 the big difference which cant be overlooked is that the united states and the european union are intervening in the tensions between georgia and russia
6375187 in 1968 you couldnt say that about czechoslovakia washington and all of western europe accepted the situation as it was and they accepted the idea that czechoslovakia belonged to the soviet sphere of influence
6375188 yesterday on august 20th 1968 at around 11 p m forces from the soviet union the polish peoples republic the german democratic republic the hungarian peoples republic and the bulgarian peoples republic crossed the state border of the czechoslovak socialist republic
6375189 this happened without the knowledge of the czechoslovak president the head of the national assembly or the prime minister and the first secretary of the central committee of the communist party of czechoslovakia and its official bodies
6375190 in these small studios there were people from czechoslovak radio and they were broadcasting for a number of days underground
6375191 they were getting news from all over prague people destroyed the names of the streets on the walls of prague it was difficult for the soviets to know where they exactly were and that brodcasting continued for a number of days
6375192 i remember the most famous athlete emil zatopek he was going from one tank to another tank and he was discussing the situation with the soviet soldiers
6375193 some of them didnt feel well you could see it they expected people with weapons fighting and now they could see just regular people who were trying to persuade them that there was nothing going on against the soviet union or that someone here in czechoslovakia wanted to start a third world war it was fascinating it was fascinating what people were doing and there was unbelievable courage
6375194 its a big mistake that your newspapers and magazines dont write the truth
6375195 if they wrote the truth you wouldnt need to come here there is no counterrevolution here as your papers write
6375196 everybody in the country was asked this wonderful question do you agree or disagree with the brotherly help of the soviet union and the warsaw pact countries and you knew quite well what that meant
6375197 you could say well i thought that they shouldnt be doing it but i was wrong and i now agree with invasion and you could keep your job in case you were a party member you were still a party member
6375198 not only you but your kids eventually could not enroll into university and you were either expelled from the communist party or crossed out if you were crossed out you still had a chance eventually to rejoin the party but if you were expelled that was the end both my parents were expelled from the communist party
6375199 it remains to this day a big trauma its a big problem which most people had to cope with but these are mostly people who come of age during the husak normalization for the younger generation the events of 1968 are truly a chapter in history which they can learn from or not but its not a personal issue for them theres a big generational difference

6375207 we plan to develop a cooperation framework which should enable us to fund some infrastructures including the slaughterhouse in brazzaville the market of national interest but also the training and building up of laboratories for control and food quality

6375212 if president mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament appoint a new cabinet it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the mou which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we dont know what his intentions are
6375213 there is one stumbling issue which we have been grappling with the framework of the power and roles of the president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of the transition leading up to two and a half years
6375214 we have this new experiment in africa where people who lose elections want to negotiate their way back into government
6375215 president mugabe will not proceed to do anything unilaterally any steps that we take have to be by consensus
6375216 eso s una vez que se han levantado los pisos estos se adjudican a las familias con m s necesidades a los que tienen muchos hijos a los que tienen a su cargo un familiar enfermo o personas mayores
6375217 una vez que la persona entra a vivir en el inmuelbe y s lo si es de nueva construcci n el propietario tendr que pagar el 10 de sus sueldo hasta que salde su deuda con el estado
6375218 claro es un m nimo por los costes de la construcci n
6375219 la nica opci n que se les facilita es la de la permuta de viviendas similares entre cubanos familias que deban trasladarse de residencia normalmente por motivos laborales y tengan que cambiar su casa con otra familia en su misma situaci n
6375220 el 60 de las familias pueden llegar a suma hasta cuatro generaciones conviviendo en un mismo hogal porque no tienen casa donde vivir claro eso hace que muchas parejas se planteen tener hijos ya somos el segundo pa s m s viejo de am rica latina despu s de uruguay pero se calcula que para 2025 seremos el primero y el acceso a una casa tiene mucho que ver en esto
6375221 adem s esta escasez de viviendas tambi n es una de las causas generadoras de la migraci n en masa
6375222 una persona se puede hacer muy vieja esperando que le den una casa por eso lo que est intentando la gente es no construirse una vivienda nueva porque eso es muy costoso sino acoplar habitaciones o pisos superiores a las casas que ya poseen pero incluso esto es complicado porque para poder hacerlo se necesita un permiso urban stico tiene que aprobarlo el arquitecto de la zona el abogado y nunca se podr construir nada que contraste con la imagen paisaj stica existente
6375223 si el ministerio de energ a necesita una persona para trabajar le van a ofrecer un hogar de una bolsa de viviendas destinada concretamente a estas personas que van a cuba a trabajar lo mismo pasa con los m dicos por ejemplo
6375224 es parad jico que en cuba el metro cuadrado alcance en muchas zonas a nueva york para estas personas s que existen inmobiliarias especializadas para ellos para los extranjeros pueden pagar por un piso entre 2 000 y 3 000 euros al mes de alquiler
6375225 los clientes de esa zona son especiales porque o tienen una vinculaci n con el barrio o son m s bohemios o tienen menos poder adquisitivo
6375226 ha comprado gente a la que le interesa la fusi n entre la arquitectura moderna y la historia de su ciudad

6375229 i came here at the age of six weeks in a laundry basket so you see with the exception of a few summers i have been coming here a long time
6375230 this is an area where an adviser can really add value if you have a long enough relationship with clients every one of them will go through medicare decisions
6375231 and if this is near the starting point of your relationship its a tremendous opportunity to secure a client for life
6375232 but lets say you dont enroll at that point because youre still working and have group coverage
6375233 i recently saw a 118 000 bill for just one morning of medical treatment
6375234 thats usually a very bad decision for anyone who could be on medicare because the government doesnt recognize 18 months of cobra as an excuse for missing a medicare enrollment period
6375235 fortunately his family discovered his problem in first quarter of the year so he was able to enroll in medicare effective july 1
6375236 he needed surgery which had to be moved up so he was in the hospital when cobra ended and his medicare penalty premium was assessed back to the open enrollment when hed turned 65
6375237 eventually their insurer sends them a bill for all the claims it paid in error claims that should have been paid by medicare
6375238 thats very hard for the average person to deal with medicare doesnt accept claims from civilians you have to get your doctors to submit them
6375239 oh yes just ask my mom the one im carrying today is my life is good book bag it holds everything i dont know for sure how many i have but at least 20 or 30 bags
6375240 i dont think im a bagaholic but i love my big black bag i probably only have about five bags and i dont change it every day
6375241 yes im a bagaholic i probably have about 20 i tend to use one for about a month then change my boyfriend and i have a rule if i bring home a new bag one i already have has to go
6375242 i normally carry a diaper bag i just love this bag i dont own a lot but when i buy one it has to be very very cool
6375243 i love bags i am definitely a bagaholic big time this one i got at a boutique in kennebunkport and i love it to death
6375244 not really a bagaholic but i love my tommy hilfiger its functional and goes with most of my clothes my mom calls it my mary poppins bag because it holds so much stuff and she never knows what im going to pull out of it
6375245 yes yes i am a bagaholic a real bag lady i love black and white and my white is great with black its a liz claiborne and i just love it i love most bags

6375248 about 50 years ago a channel was constructed by means of bulkheads and piling which ran from perkins cove up to flat pond as a result of this helpful though crude improvement a thriving fishing business sprung up it is said that 26 whaleboats and 10 dories were engaged in business at one time since then the natural course of the sea has washed away the channel and the fishing business has practically died out as a result the association wants the harbor rebuilt
6375249 a small fixed footbridge owned by the ogunquit village corporation crosses the josias river 550 feet from its mouth this footbridge has a horizontal clearance of approximately 30 feet and a vertical clearance of about 5 feet at mean high water no federal permit was issued for the construction of this bridge the proposed improvement would necessitate the reconstruction of the span to provide a draw opening of sufficient horizontal clearance for navigation
6375250 a letter from the war department stated that the bridge at perkins cove prevented a coast guard patrol boat from entering the cove and improvements or changes would have to be made
6375251 the high winds and rain of last wednesday loosened the ice to such an extent in perkins cove that it broke and started out to sea on its way it took bridge and all with it there is now only a small portion of the bridge remaining on either side of the river the draw and parts of the bridge went out workmen were able to rescue part of the bridge however and fasten it to a point about a hundred yards or so below the original location
6375252 basically i was trying to get her to lie down while we ate dinner
6375253 i got involved just because i brought my dog to be trained
6375254 but then i loved it so much i wanted to do more
6375255 for a lot of people its kind of their outlet with their dogs from the everyday world
6375256 six weeks of training is not going to be all someone wants to do
6375257 usually they do at least two sessions and a lot of people get hooked
6375258 its more like play and exposing them to different kinds of environments and socialization
6375259 dogs really enjoy it no matter what age they are
6375260 i tell people you want a dog that makes you happy without making other people unhappy
6375261 they naturally will jump up and bark we teach them to become good citizens and good members of the family
6375262 builds that basic relationship between a person and their dog
6375263 its a lot easier to make a puppy lie down than it is a 60 to 80 pound dog
6375264 we have a lot of dogs that come to us when theyre teenagers around seven to eight months old
6375265 thats when the dogs start showing their independence when puppies are little they stay closer to you but as they get older they start wandering
6375266 its really absolutely wonderful so many people were willing to contribute
6375267 thats more than 10 percent of the applications we received in all of 2007
6375268 its an easy process and it doesnt take much time at all
6375269 all the applicant needs to do is call us to set up an appointment then on the day of the appointment the applicant needs to bring in the required documentation
6375270 but it helps us as well the more clients we can see off site that is in town halls rather than here at the yccac main office in sanford the easier it is for us to get the applications in the pipeline and processed for payment
6375271 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters

6375292 im surprised and absolutely thrilled to have won its a great car
6375293 i cant say it was all enjoyable i wouldnt do it again but it has been incredible we were on ice roads virtually all the way from moscow thousands and thousands of miles and could not believe how much traction we got from the cooper tyres they were phenomenal
6375294 landing on wales was brilliant it was the culmination of nearly nine years work and to be the first to get across was incredible id watched other people before me try to do it rich people big companies and i thought how am i going to square up to these people but i showed them how its done
6375295 denmark were better than us in the first half but we reacted well and ended up playing a good game against high level opposition
6375296 we have to recognise that if it hadnt been for defender carles puyol and goalkeeper iker casillas we would have conceded at least one goal but the players confidence and skill allowed us to overcome the poor start and win
6375297 weve got two fifa world cup qualifiers coming up and we have to get things right because we cant afford to make any mistakes we are the favourites to go through but we cant slip up especially at home
6375298 with the players we have in the team we need to keep playing the same way and it worked against denmark especially in the second half
6375299 there are a lot of young players in this team and we havent fulfilled our potential yet we want to continue the progress we made at uefa euro 2008 and with del bosque it looks as though we are going to do that
6375300 as of now theres no plan to be on the show
6375301 the emirati youth has little interest in sport compared to young people in other countries with the exception of football

6375303 wir unterst tzen russland in dieser situation und sind gegen die versuche russland zu verleumden

6375307 we chose oracle because it is secure compatible and easy to maintain
6375308 of late security has become crucial for financial institutions and oracle database has what we need
6375309 with oracle secure and reliable availability of data has enhanced our customer service
6375310 in order to enhance our efficiency we chose to implement flexcube oracle database and oracle financial services ondemand as a result of this we were able to replace the banks manual processes at the same time we were also able to enhance customer intimacy which we built over many years and ultimately develop greater competitive differentiation
6375311 we are happy to be able to serve mid size financial institutions with robust end to end solutions
6375312 banks around the world and in indias emerging cities rely on oracle to help them streamline business processes meet increasing regulatory compliance demands and improve cost efficiency ratios while providing greater value to customers
6375313 database archiving often fails to get the attention it needs compared to other critical activities related to production databases and data warehouses
6375314 an archival system becomes critical when you need to access archived information in response to a legal summons customer service issue security investigation or technical issue the value of archiving grows considerably as it becomes easier to access the archived data
6375315 with legal demands for access growing conventional approaches to database archiving are increasingly being found lacking they focus on lifting and shifting inactive data from production databases to improve application performance without considering how to optimize the way archived data is stored get your archiving right and you reduce storage costs and guarantee simple future proofed access get it wrong and at worst you could face prison
6375316 why database archiving should be part of your dbms strategy
6375317 it managers need to achieve a balance between the compliance demands for retention and the business demand for economical storage and retrieval current database management system technology is optimised for transactional processing data warehouses are optimised for analytics but both fail to adequately address archiving needs worse still the lines between archive stores and backup which have very different drivers and requirements are all too often blurred
6375318 forresters research clearly illustrates the need for the new generation of archive stores these deliver both massive reductions in storage footprints through data compression together with the security immutability and point in time query capability that enables quick simple and unimpeachable fulfilment of regulatory obligations

6375320 our mobile distribution strategy relies on geniems state of the art odp technology bringing the best entertainment to the mobile by offering music video clips and games through browse taste and buy experience
6375321 this agreement represents a major milestone in our global deployment of mobile entertainment and we are delighted to be providing rotana our odp technologies to offer the very best content for mobiles throughout the entire middle east region

6375323 sms provides an easy to use mobile solution that doesnt require long wait times or interactive voice response systems to better serve mobile customers and save money organizations with call centers should take advantage of text messaging
6375324 our customers prefer sms it saves them the trouble of having to dial in to the call center or visit a branch to get the account information they need with sms our customer gets convenience and fnb saves money in addition to delivering a better customer experience sms has also greatly reduced call center costs associated with communicating routine account information
6375325 with the widespread use of mobile phones and innate understanding of text combined with our customers desire to maintain active control of their finances fnbs incontact has provided our customers with the ability to take advantage of their cell phone as a powerful banking tool
6375326 interacting with customers through sms costs a fraction of what a live agent costs are so the cost savings for us have been tremendous and the communications are effective and pleasing to the customer which helps our business
6375327 organizations across all industries should take full advantage of these cost savings by implementing text based call center services in any industry financial services or otherwise
6375328 sms in the call center how mobile messaging can increase profits and reduce costs immediately

6375335 the milf leadership is willing to take disciplinary actions once those reported atrocities to civilians would be proven correct and right but there should be an investigation first because we could not just give any disciplinary action unless the truth is determined
6375336 the chairman of the milf has already spoken that we felt very sorry about the situation that there was no sanction from the highest leadership of the milf but we are calling for a fair and impartial investigation on the matter
6375337 the cancellation of the memorandum of agreement is a painful step in our collective effort to come to an agreement with the milf
6375338 she arroyo will seek a new agreement within the boundaries of law set within the constitution furthermore the president will not allow adventurism by milf forces to pressure government to sign any agreement even if it is for peace
6375339 from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogue with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogues with the people the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment

6375344 if people are doing things differently it costs more and it takes more time because theyre having to do all the start up work
6375345 were saying lets learn from the things that have gone well across forces and the mistakes so well work together with hr communities to achieve a national standard which potentially could be a mandatory thing
6375346 the hr standards would be in delivery terms so if the inspectorate is going out theyd know what to expect in manchester for example theyd know what good looked like
6375347 but the standards wont be regional theyll be national for the first time the inspectorate can then go out and inspect against them
6375348 the hr community has said it themselves wouldnt it be great if we had one conversation if were not reinventing the wheel sharing best practice and learning from each other
6375349 this is not a copy of a pc on tv
6375350 we are setting a new bar and delivering a richer internet experience to tv like never before
6375351 who shot jr beam me up scotty youre fired and good night and good luck you know these lines better than i do
6375352 i dont have to name the show or the stars why because we all want and we all love tv
6375353 in the past the idea was to put the browser on tv and use a text based interface which would interfere with the programme
6375354 this leaves the user in the environment they are comfortable with which is watching tv
6375355 companies still spend five times as much ad money on the tv as the web
6375356 advertising is sold more effectively on tv the problem with tv is that everyone sees the same ad
6375357 it puts tv not on an even footing with the internet as a mass medium but it could potentially leapfrog it because of the improved dynamic of the big screen audio experience
6375358 up until now there has been no consistent architecture to do this well
6375359 no de facto platform to fuse the internet with tv
6375360 for the first time we are bringing the full richness of the internet and web 2 0 and optimising the tv while respecting the tvs unique attributes simplicity easy of use socialising and entertainment value all the things that people love about tv
6375361 if you look at these things what they boil down to is is it compelling to use am i as a consumer going to sit on my couch with my very expensive tv and think wow i really want to go and look at the weather
6375362 as we have seen a lot of people are doing that with their laptop on their knee during the olympics or the superbowl which is inconvenient and involves just one person
6375363 so getting to the stage where you can bring some of that functionality to the tv without it being disruptive to the viewing experience is what has been missing to date
6375364 our daily life here in sinop was much affected by the bird flu this is funny but at the same time quite tragic an ancient species has been destroyed in our city because of a silly phobia
6375365 we have lost the genuine hacikadins and now he have a cardboard replica of it displayed at the museum

6375379 i think that the proper measure is how much theyre spending not how much theyre spending relative to the budget
6375380 they have enough money to keep going for two years plus without any new budget
6375381 so the question is how do we help them or how do they help themselves spend more money in the current year and in the next six months
6375382 in this report we added them together just to say actual expenditure as such

6375414 all of those characters were built from assets that are part of this kit so although they were actually characters we rendered out through a 3d application for promo purposes its all stuff that you could build with the assets in here
6375415 in terms of rare being involved in this project i think it was a very specific decision on microsofts part to get us involved
6375416 we have the ability to develop multiple things at once so theres an opportunity for us to use this in a very close knit way with our own team to develop stuff and that leads onto the fact we can then use those games as a testing bed to make the use of the avatars for developers very simple i think thats one reason why we got the nod to do this stuff people like scene it one of the games that will use avatars for example weve given a blob of stuff to them and its been very simple for them to put avatars into their game

6375421 hairstyles is the one thing we found people wanted more of because it really identifies them in some of the tests we ran women in particular pick the hairstyle and say thats me so we want as many as we can

6375424 the first question i get asked is why go back to world war ii
6375425 we didnt want to go back and make the same old world war ii game treyarch has done it before world at war is their fourth call of duty game theyve been developing call of duty games for longer than world war ii was actually fought
6375426 so they didnt want to go back and make another game that youve all played before they felt very much like you guys do its long in the tooth its stale
6375427 so that was the big challenge how do they redefine what everyone expects from a world war ii game
6375428 more brutal and more intense call of duty than youve seen before

6375610 our investigations revealed that our courier man has went to your residence to deliver the said package he had went back to the said location again to re confirm with the residents but somehow no one recognizes the signature on the delivery consignment note in any case were sorry for this loss of your item as it may be potentially mis delivered and we are unable to retrieve the package back for you therefore we shall proceed with the compensation of your item in full value and refund the paid shipping charge
6375611 it is curious that a package for a xxx address winds up in zzz road as i do recall that the two locations are separated by distance spanning a couple of kilometres furthermore what i find galling is that the postman in charge of said delivery insisted on the article being properly delivered and even coming to our apartment some days ago to ask for our households residents signatures for verification i finally feel vindicated now from insinuations that it was us who were in the wrong and dishonestly signed for and kept the item i am not usually one for harshness but in this case i strongly feel the postman or parties responsible should be strictly reprimanded and disciplined for refusing to acknowledge their mistakes and for veiled finger pointing with regard to the integrity of our household

6375787 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6375788 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6375789 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6375790 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed

6375817 if you read the manifestation of the solicitor general there is no formal manifestation that the moa will no longer be signed the solicitor general has to convince the court that the moa will no longer be signed
6375818 the issuance by the honorable court of a temporary restraining order coupled by present condition in some areas in mindanao dictates that the moa in its present form must undergo a thorough review in fact the executive department will pursue further negotiations with the milf to address the issues hurled against the moa
6375819 further negotiations with milf necessitate consultation with various stakeholders including those who will be affected by the expansion of the present autonomous region in muslim mindanao
6375820 a statement from government that it will undertake a review of the terms of the moa or will renegotiate its terms is not tantamount to a commitment that they will not sign the same
6375821 it would shape future talks between the government and the milf

6375890 hes upset about his picture being released and his name being linked to these crimes that he has had absolutely nothing to do with
6375891 i dont want any officer or any resident to think hey i can relax now we dont want them scared but we want them aware
6375892 could still be out here walking in the crowd he may have had a partner
6375893 he had nothing to do with this and he expects the dna to clear him
6375894 she went into the store and found him in the rear storage area with his hands tied behind his back and his feet bound with tape and string shot once in the head
6375895 i knew him he was a muslim boy a good dude nice as all outdoors this is a senseless killing
6375896 we are a peaceful people we came here for a better life that boy came here for a better life now his life is destroyed

6375911 he grabbed a hose started squirting himself then went in to try to save the kids but he couldnt make it
6375912 the smoke and heat were too much for him and they had to pull him out
6375913 i could see people running back and forth and heard her neighbor screaming she was saying my baby is in the basement my baby is in the basement
6375914 i looked over and saw the smoke and went in my house to call 911 it was just a horrible thing i wouldnt want myself to be in her predicament
6375915 my brother would do anything for anybody hes one of a kind
6375916 he just likes to help people what else could he do here
6375917 chris understood that his continuing presence in the office would be a distraction
6375918 i did not reach this decision lightly chris has been a loyal and effective city employee for many years he deserves the presumption of innocence unless and until the courts find otherwise
6375919 should chris be exonerated of all charges i would welcome him back as chief of staff and do whatever is necessary to see that he receives full back pay
6375920 with sadness i announce that i have requested a leave of absence from my duties as chief of staff for councilman jack kelly i have taken this action because it is in the councilmans best interest and the best interests of the citizens of philadelphia i have requested that my leave begin immediately and extend until after the trial of the charges against me
6375921 you could throw a body in there and you wouldnt find it
6375922 we want them to tear the rest of the building down or make it so it isnt an eyesore drug dealers can go in there and smoke people bring there trash there its dangerous for kids
6375923 we complained to everybody there were 15 squatters living at the same time in that house
6375924 i cant afford an air conditioner but these squatters had one they had tvs refrigerators stealing electricity they were living it up
6375925 i called the police two weeks before the fire but they just took a report i told them the squatters were there
6375926 you might as well not call because they dont come
6375927 officers will tell police radio to call l amp i to have the place resealed but were not here to board up places so now its incumbent on l amp i to board it up
6375928 its a dynamic number you make the efforts to treat the worst of the worst and you start over again next year
6375929 l amp i has not been examined with this kind of scrutiny and it needs to be because no matter what anybody there does they are playing triage constantly
6375930 i dont think they have the necessary resources to do their job adequately
6375931 what we are looking at specifically is black history in communities across the state how black communities developed where they were located who comprised black communities and what they looked like
6375932 were the first state in the nation to undertake this kind of a comprehensive survey and analysis of black history
6375933 pennsylvania has taken a leadership role here in looking at this history and evaluating its significance
6375934 in these communities there were significant black populations that to a larger extent were not well understood
6375935 part of what were trying to do is to have them understood a little better
6375936 i think its an important project for this museum to work on
6375937 we certainly look forward to the products that can come out of this project
6375938 the thinking behind what we can do with this information is limitless
6375939 in pennsylvania even rural areas played a significant role in the underground railroad
6375940 where we find evidence of it we are looking at the underground railroad
6375941 were finding a rich history of underground railroad activity around those areas
6375942 were collecting genealogy information and oral histories and were also detailing how to find hidden histories in cemeteries destroyed homes and things like that
6375943 one thing that we find is that everyone wants to have their community studied
6375944 no pants moma i want to wear either a skirt shirt or a dress
6375945 arrivato il momento giusto di mettere da parte la ragione e seguire solo il tuo istinto per questa volta fidati totalmente di quello ke ti suggerisce il cuore non sbaglierai
6375946 the goal should not be to see how much money you can raise from stuggling families in south jersey
6375947 but there needs to be money available to be sure the bridges are in safe condition
6375948 its never popular to vote on a toll increase but it is my conclusion that it is the appropriate thing to do
6375949 it is our responsibility to make sure these bridges are operational and safe the public can be assured that 100 percent of the money will go into these structures
6375950 the drpa is a public authority run on public money and should give credence to public input
6375951 the public must be involved and not ignored before any future increases are implemented
6375952 older people dont like anything changed we dont like the modern stuff
6375953 there are problems with e zpass why would they insist on us using that
6375954 i carried it back to my van and laid it on a towel to dry
6375955 whoever it belonged to we wanted them to get it back especially if they lost a lot in the fire
6375956 they might still be running around and getting new licenses identification and a place to live
6375957 we intend to follow through on this and think it will be accepted
6375958 all the examples for why our church was not selected
6375959 not just handicapped accessible but so that handicapped persons can participate with total integration as active members of the faith community
6375960 because no new parish exists there is no basis for an appeal at this time
6375961 ive been considering a job in north jersey so if prices continue to drop then i will go
6375962 but that is changing i think people are really aware now that when we put the pedal to metal that is costing them money
6375963 demand for gas is driven largely by increased demand in india and china
6375964 some people have found they get a certain amount of pride and satisfaction
6375965 what were seeing now is a clear regrouping and also again some kind of deception campaign saying look were moving out
6375966 this is an exceptional important step particularly for new jerseyans who struggle with property taxes as well as all of the other rising levels of inflationary costs
6375967 on the state level we remain vigilant in our dedication to property tax relief for homeowners
6375968 over 600 000 here in new jersey own property pay property taxes but do not itemize on their income taxes
6375969 as a senior citizen on a fixed income this is certainly going to help with our property taxes
6375970 but with all the americans coming the party on the fourth outgrew the embassy
6375971 the last three of four years its been held at this large resort hotel on the edge of the city
6375972 the longer tenured americans have assimilated to a degree meaning they speak chinese fluently have actual chinese friends as opposed to language partners and can generally move comfortably in chinese society
6375973 but the majority are here just to make money or enjoy the ease of expat life they speak just enough chinese to get by binge on black market dvds when theyre not in the bars and seem generally content to bounce around in their various bubbles
6375974 theyre the kind of communities that could be set down anywhere
6375975 there are pizza huts and ben amp jerrys out there for them the people that live there are commuters who might not even know theyre in china
6375976 its true there are a lot of americans in sanlitun
6375977 but whats really american about it are all the bars ten to 12 years ago the only american style bars you could find were in the hotels now theyre all over the place
6375978 despite a lot of the anti authoritarian swagger amongst americans here
6375979 many still spend quite a few of their nights in the sanlitun drinking district which the government set up in the early days of the reform period to keep foreigners ghettoized and hence easy to monitor
6375980 ive been here over six years and it used to be the one thing that most americans missed was cheese
6375981 but now there are shops where you can get almost any kind of cheese you can imagine
6375982 how a city with several passable to good french and fusion restaurants fails to produce a single edible enchilada is mystifying
6375983 that said whenever im back in the u s i long just as much for uighur food from northwestern china i hear rumors theres a few uighur restaurants in queens now but ive never been able to find them

6375994 i got out of the marines with the intention of becoming a high school teacher
6375995 i was just thinking its time to stop being a student and start being a teacher
6375996 in some ways weve reduced their anxiety and in other ways weve increased it
6375997 every time you go in its like your first time ever
6375998 the fact that they even take time to have something like this helps me with my anxieties
6375999 i hope i can be that great history teacher for my students one day
6376000 as soon as that first day is over ill be fine
6376001 once our engineers get their hands on it theyll twist and turn it

6376004 the bottom line is that sen obamas words for all their eloquence and passion dont mean all that much
6376005 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6376006 its time to make a declaration that animals need to be protected
6376007 the maggots which eat dead flesh probably saved his life
6376008 and these abused and neglected animals suffer more than any of us can imagine
6376009 when we started the hotline we estimated 200 calls per month which would have been 1 200 calls after six months
6376010 im hoping it will send a message and that message will be heard
6376011 we will not tolerate the abuse and neglect of animals any longer

6376015 when you read through the books there is no mention of islam allah or the koran
6376016 i used an islamic archetype but the actual stories dont show any islam because they are based on values that we all share
6376017 are based on religious archetypes like the prophets from the bible they are all orphans superman left his parents on the planet krypton and batman sees his father and mother gunned down in front of him
6376018 the goal is to teach children that there are 99 ways to solve a problem
6376019 in the eighth issue jabbar the powerful must rely on nooras ability to see the light of truth in others to annihilate the bad guys
6376020 even though there are approximately 50 female superheroes only five will be covered in that way
6376021 i want to send the message out that there is not only one way to be muslim
6376022 when you hear these stories of saddam hussein who was cast as a hero and then ended up torturing his own people you ask yourself what kind of message we are sending our kids about what a hero does
6376023 with the 99 i wanted to make a difference and give muslim kids positive role models
6376024 not only are the stories entertaining and the art extraordinary
6376025 but the 99 have also enabled others to understand a wider vision than what they are normally exposed to through the medium and helped to promote cultural understanding and acceptance

6376032 the area they were in is covered in really jagged sharp rocks which were part submerged by the incoming tide and there was definitely no way back for them
6376033 i would not normally consider going anywhere near the wrangles but instinct just kicked in there were two young boys on the rocks who needed help and i knew my wetsuit would at least be some protection
6376034 we huddled together with my back to the wind and i kept them moving up the rock away from the incoming tide

6376039 we havent finalized the order in which they will appear or the precise dates but a amp a is high on the list
6376040 i love our current implementation of axis amp allies but imagine having the ability to play that game like you can play gto backgammon on facebook asymmetrically or live a amp a is a game that really begs for that kind of flexibility and gametable online has always been about trying to give people more opportunities to play the games that they love
6376041 there is some work involved in doing the transition from gto to facebook especially for some of the older games so priorities for which will get moved over will depend on the ease in which we can do it and whether or not specific publishers come forward to express interest in helping to offset the costs involved in doing the transition
6376042 every now and again along comes an athlete for the times and i believe usain bolt is that athlete

6376052 take off accidents are very very rare you reach a point in take off when it is unlikely that anything can go wrong but if things do go wrong they can go wrong very quickly
6376053 if you go above v1 and abort the take off there is insufficient room at the end of the runway and there is the chance of going off the end of the runway at a very fast speed and things can then go very badly wrong
6376054 the normal rule is that if you go beyond v1 and something goes wrong you take off anyway if for example a tyre blew you would take off
6376055 a problem at the point of take off is very challenging for the pilot if something happens at the point of v1 he is committed to taking off if there is an engine failure at this point he is flying an aircraft at very low speed
6376056 the manner of the negotiations doesnt surprise me because i know how much the president appreciated sheva how many times he said he tried to bring him back to milan and now hes succeeded
6376057 we are close to the end of the deal and i hope that these little things that have to be fulfilled are done as soon as possible
6376058 i would be extremely delighted if shevchenko returns to milan and i am ready to embrace the ukraine champion again for us its about a return home
6376059 we felt wilton deserved a chance to start because he played well off the bench in the last few games
6376060 it is always good to have some consistency in selection because the guys know what to expect from each other on the field
6376061 it also builds towards a more consistent performance as the season progresses because the guys start functioning as a unit
6376062 we have deliberately chosen these men because of the importance attached to these areas of club management

6376112 in the years before the fatal crash there had been assassination attempts against walter and victor reuther victor believes the attempt against him was intended as a message to walter in each of these instances state and federal law enforcement agencies showed themselves at best lackadaisical in their investigative efforts suggesting the possibility of official collusion or at least tolerance for the criminal deeds third like the suspicious near crash that occurred the previous year the fatal crash also involved a faulty altimeter in a small plane it is a remarkable coincidence that reuther would have been in two planes with the exact same malfunctioning in that brief time frame in a follow up interview with us victor further noted animosity from government had been present for some time before the fatal crash it was not only walters stand on vietnam and cambodia that angered nixon but also i had exposed some cia elements inside labor and this was also associated with walter there is a fine line between the mob and the cia there is a lot of crossover throughout the entire history of labor relations there is a sordid history of industry in league with hoover and the mafia you need to check into right wing corporate groups and their links to the national security system checking into such things is no easy task the fbi still refuses to turn over nearly 200 pages of documents regarding reuthers death including the copious correspondence between field offices and hoover and many of the released documents some of them forty years old are totally inked out it is hard to fathom what national security concern is involved or why the fbi and cia still keep so many secrets about walter reuthers life and death

6376136 nobody would join the contra forces down there without my knowledge and approval

6376141 he norwin meneses and his brother luis enrique had financed the contra revolution with the benefits of the cocaine they sold
6376142 this operation as norwin told me was executed with the collaboration of high ranking salvadoran military personnel they met with officials of the salvadoran air force who flew planes to colombia and then left for the u s bound for an air force base in texas as he told me

6376149 ron spear a spokesman for los angeles county sheriff sherman block said bland n somehow knew that he was under police surveillance others thought so too the cops always believed that investigation had been compromised by the cia los angeles federal public defender barbara oconnor said in a recent interview
6376150 how do you explain the fact that norwin meneses implicated since 1974 in the trafficking of drugs has not been detained in the united states a country in which he has lived entered and departed many times since 1974
6376151 well that question needs to be asked to the authorities of the united states
6376152 the justice department flipped out to prevent us from getting access to people records finding anything out about it

6376188 if you look at the numbers the average us household belongs to 12 different loyalty programs but they only use about a third of them
6376189 that means that there is just so much money being invested into these loyalty programs that just sort of fall out of the wallet or end up in the sock drawer to never be used again
6376190 if i make an investment in this program at the end of the day is it going to make me more money

6376202 paulus had in rome geen belemmeringen om over het evangelie te spreken innerlijk niet en van buitenaf niet dat was heel wonderlijk omdat hij in de gevangenis zat
6376203 het woord onverhinderd ziet op belemmeringen van buitenaf die er niet waren
6376204 maar hij eindigt daar toch niet mee want het gaat niet om paulus maar om de voortgang van het woord laat het genoeg zijn als we horen van de kracht van het werk van god
6376205 sommigen zoals saulus maken een krachtdadige ommekeer mee anderen zoals david en obadja worden van jongs af geleid door de heilige geest
6376206 de heere is lankmoedig barmhartig en genadig voor alle bekeerlingen de weg leidt van boven naar beneden in iedere bekering is sprake van gods vrijmacht elke bekering is een levendmaking uit de doden

6376208 het ging hem er niet om dat de mensen in donker afrika zuurkool zouden leren eten maar om het verkondigen van de naam van jezus hoe houd je het vol na een overval of na het neerstorten van een zendingsvliegtuig als je leven gedragen wordt door die ene naam kom je erdoor

6376217 binnen een halfjaar de contouren voor dit team helder zijn
6376218 de deelnemers wisselen elkaars beste werkmethoden ervaringen en deskundigheid uit
6376219 mijn vader fietst klust en is nog altijd druk met zijn groentetuin
6376220 ze constateerde geen afwijkingen maar wilde vader vanwege zijn klachten toch naar het ziekenhuis sturen juist op dat moment zakte hij in elkaar
6376221 de huisarts blokkeerde volledig wist niet wat ze moest doen
6376222 ik heb er echt kracht voor gekregen toen de ambulance arriveerde en de verpleegkundige het overnam ben ik huilend naar de keuken gevlucht totdat ik hem hoorde zeggen hij doet het weer
6376223 menselijkerwijs gesproken had mijn vader het niet overleefd maar e n staat er boven ik ben me er terdege van bewust dat we het leven niet in eigen hand hebben maar we mogen de vaardigheden die we hebben wel gebruiken
6376224 mensen van die leeftijd kunnen naar de mens gesproken nog een behoorlijk aantal jaren krijgen dat is toch genadetijd als dit soort besluiten wordt doorgevoerd dan nemen we de tijd in eigen hand bovendien hebben deze mensen dan geen recht van bestaan meer
6376225 ook daar speelde de discussie over wel of niet reanimeren de vrouw is niet gereanimeerd en uiteindelijk overleden terwijl ze zich alleen maar verslikte
6376226 een naaste in nood help je dat zou in de totale zorg zo moeten zijn
6376227 het is niet aan ons om te bepalen of iemand nog levenswaardig is of niet
6376228 het leek alsof ik nog altijd trots was op inbreken en het gebruik van geweld het was onvoldoende duidelijk dat ik daar echt afstand van heb genomen
6376229 de scherpe reacties laten zien dat het goed is hierover te praten de roerige jaren tachtig zijn bij velen niet echt bekend en als ze bekend zijn niet verwerkt ik wilde me verantwoorden over hoe ik daar in heb gestaan zolang ik dat niet had gedaan voelde het onaf
6376230 als je tegenwoordig bakker bent ligt het anders dan wanneer je een publiek persoon bent bijvoorbeeld een volksvertegenwoordiger op hen rust een zwaardere plicht tot openheid
6376231 ik heb de achterliggende jaren altijd antwoord gegeven als er vragen kwamen over mijn verleden maar het was steeds fragmentarisch nu ik een boek ging schrijven over het klimaatprobleem wilde ik me voor het eerst meer systematisch verantwoorden
6376232 ik wil laten zien hoe de dingen echt gegaan zijn hoe ik tot mijn keuzes gekomen ben hoe de tijdsomstandigheden waren waarin ik deed wat ik deed
6376233 dat is absoluut niet mijn bedoeling ik neem ondubbelzinnig afstand van bepaalde acties waarbij ik toen betrokken was inbraak geweld dat is nooit goed te keuren maar wat ik tevens probeer uit te leggen is dat als je eenmaal in een bepaalde beweging terechtkomt je van het ene op het andere komt geweld en opsluiting door de politie het maakte mij nog furieuzer en zo kom je in een verkeerde spiraal
6376234 het punt is dat ik door de storm van publiciteit die losbrak voor mijn gevoel in een achtbaan terechtkwam waardoor ik alle grip op de dingen verloor ik wilde weer vaste grond onder mijn voeten die kon ik alleen krijgen door eerst maar eens een stapje terug te doen en het opgeven van mijn kamerlidmaatschap was natuurlijk ook wel een beetje een gebaar naar verberg de topambtenaar van ez die ik destijds door het publiceren van zijn adresgegevens ernstig heb geschaad
6376235 dat is makkelijk uit te leggen donderdagavond gaf ik mijn kamerlidmaatschap op vrijdag kwam de telegraaf met weer een heleboel feiten over mijn verleden was ik nog kamerlid geweest dan was ik die morgen door journalisten platgebeld nu bleef het volledig stil aan die rust had ik behoefte
6376236 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6376237 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6376238 at this difficult time for retailers and family budgets its vital that the government acts to restore
6376239 families are being squeezed by a whole raft of rising costs from increased utility bills to higher petrol prices

6376256 diese zahlen spiegeln die st rke unseres gesch ftsmodells in einer f r die branche sehr schwierigen phase wider auch wenn viele banken mit einem gewinnzuwachs von 57 prozent im ersten halbjahr eines jahres wie wir es 2008 erleben mehr als zufrieden w ren hatten wir uns eigentlich ein noch besseres ergebnis gew nscht

6376303 ser una inc gnita porque ser la primera vez que juguemos contra ellos en esta temporada

6376307 i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch bunch
6376308 el rottweiler el pitbull y el dogo argentino son perros grandes con mucha fuerza y temperamento por eso hay que ser responsables al hacer la elecci n del animal si se desea tener un ejemplar de alguna de estas razas hay que darles el espacio la alimentaci n y los cuidados que necesitan
6376309 si al perro no se lo cuida no es l el culpable de su agresividad ni la raza a la que pertenece hay animales que est n atados en el fondo de la casa y que ni siquiera ven a los due os
6376310 de los 300 chicos que llegan a la guardia diariamente 10 sufrieron mordeduras de perros en promedio los casos son de distinta gravedad y la proporci n de ni os atacados por perros callejeros o por sus propias mascotas es casi la misma el chico ve al perro como un juguete lo toca y no lo respeta entonces el animal reacciona
6376311 lamentablemente est n de moda los perros de razas grandes y la gente no tiene un conocimiento profundo sobre sus caracter sticas muchos afirman que compran un rottweiler o un dogo para que les cuiden la casa pero es sabido que otro animal un mestizo por ejemplo tambi n es muy buen guardi n

6376322 complete revolution in the new green sustainable energy sources that we use
6376323 the government has spooked everyone into thinking that we need nuclear by saying theres going to be a terrible energy gap the lights are going to go out in the middle of the next decade
6376324 theres actually no evidence that that is the case at all they have raised the wrong problem in order to push the wrong solution
6376325 the real problem is that our energy mix is not green enough and that we are overdependent as many people now realise because of the crisis in georgia on oil and gas from parts of the world that arent very reliable

6376377 we are what we think your imagination can do more harm than your worst enemy
6376378 in hindsight it might be a blessing as he is a stronger horse now
6376379 i think he has the potential to be the best three year old in the country this spring
6376380 what could be better than training horses what else would i do
6376381 we never want to imagine something like this happening to one of our colleagues not from just doing their daily work
6376382 sania mirza has been advised complete rest for an initial period of three weeks by her consulting doctor after undergoing intensive tests
6376383 ive always done well at the us open and it is very disappointing for me to miss the grand slam on my favourite surface due to my wrist injury
6376384 i am very happy he has brought about glory to the very profession of wrestling it has increased our value in the field of sports
6376385 it is a matter of happiness for us he has become a source of inspiration for the coming generations and people would now increasingly take this sport which was originally a sport of the common man
6376386 ive given everything i could so im delighted it paid off i wanted to get excited when i knew we had won a gold or silver but i had to try to keep the emotions out of it because there was still a job to do not for one second did we ever give up the hope we would win in the team sprint so much can happen and we knew if we did the absolute perfect ride we stood a chance the olympic games takes it out of you essentially four years of effort coming down to a mere 17 seconds four years of work flashed in front of my face when chris crossed the finish line and it was all worth it i came into track cycling to win a gold medal because bmx wasnt an olympic discipline back then it has taken longer than i thought but i am ecstatic
6376387 ive got a few months travelling planned at the end of the year and im going to forget about the bike for a bit ive got so many people to thank from family and friends to the incredible support team weve got and my incredible team mates its been an amazing journey i remember my first games in sydney and i was so chuffed to come away with the bronze this time nothing but gold would have done
6376388 this achievement is absolutely awesome but its even better to think that the core of that team will go onto london and probably keep getting better
6376389 paul is a fantastic guy to have around and a big member of this team
6376390 i enjoyed the individual pursuit medal for about half an hour and then the medal went in the drawer i knew id be very disappointed if we didnt win the team pursuit after being so close in sydney and athens all along my focus has been three gold medals i suppose you get greedy but its not wrong to be a bit greedy in sport
6376391 he wasnt out for long and is in good order and is fit and well
6376392 were very happy with the way hes going hes in great shape and has three wins over this trip
6376393 everything hes done in the lead up has been pleasing his trial his exhibition gallop trackwork everything
6376394 its always exciting riding this horse and im sure he wont disappoint on the weekend
6376395 this is the first olympics we have all been together and we have four more years to improve until london we have done british records in the heats and the finals so thats fantastic we are growing as a team and bonding and that is not just as a relay team but the whole of british swimming we are looking to the future this is the beginning of great things hopefully the girls did a great job and we were inspired to get in there and give it our best and we got a british record so you cant ask for more than that
6376396 we knew he had been in intensive care for the last few weeks but because he was hanging in there we thought hed pull through
6376397 its very upsetting ben was always a bright happy person in any situation with a very easygoing manner
6376398 we are currently involved internationally in a 1 5 million program just in the last 12 months collaborating with international researchers
6376399 basic research has been done but as you would probably realise it takes quite a number of years to develop a vaccine against any new disease
6376400 so theres not a lot there to go on in terms of the natural progression of the disease
6376401 after six cases its very very hard to know what the cause is but there needs to be significant exposure and only people whove had close relationships with horses have been sick or have died
6376402 my goal was just to make it through each round and get through to the final ive done that now so i can re evaluate my goals i was pleased ive been taking this one race at a time and i am getting quicker as we go the semi final was a second better than my heat two have two brits through competing in a final was so exciting unfortunately michael phelps is just different class
6376403 i know how that company works its 20 off everything except all the brands and departments you want
6376404 i lost vacuum cleaners televisions and cds im still waiting to hear off the insurer
6376405 it was flowing in the back door and flowing out the front door
6376406 in taking my stand alone position against giving the go ahead to this development i was working from official data that made the strongest case that no development should take place without firstly spending a sum of not less than 3 million to safe guard existing homes businesses and farmlands this is now the third time that these flood plains have taken water since earlier this year when laois county council granted planning for this development
6376407 i am more convinced than ever before that protecting flood plains and not allowing any development is the only way that we can protect housing estates like kilnacourt businesses and farms from being destroyed in the future
6376408 at the end of the day our council gives planning permission to develop on a flood plain
6376409 from what i heard they were trying to get at one lad everyone knows who he is we think it has to do with gangs or something
6376410 water was pouring onto the road and the homes of people were being threatened so the action had to be taken to relieve the lake
6376411 firstly the water in the lakes was high but not bursting the design of the lakes is that they flood and the banks of the lakes contain the water they took a jcb to the bridged bank between the second and third lake dumping what they took out into the lake the force of the water pushed a hole that you could drive a bus through straight through to the third lake sending sand concrete and debris flying into the lake into a reeded area containing nests and young of waterhens and coots
6376412 brendan was out of the house when he heard this loud bang and he knew the river had broken its bank he ran inside the house and threw himself against the backdoor to stop the water coming in as did mother she was pushed back by the force of the river
6376413 it was very lucky that brendan was there with her she has been living their since 1951 and has never seen flooding like this at all
6376414 the water came up with such speed that it had no where to go when it hit the bridge that it cut across the backyard
6376415 it was one of the busiest weekends in a long time every fire station was out and everybody we had on call was working we had floods in portlaoise portarlington mountmellick clonaslee abbeyleix and durrow literally the whole county was flooded some brigades were on the go for nearly 24 hours straight
6376416 the portarlington area experienced flooding but recovered reasonably well the worst was in graiguecullen and killeshin as a result of the high ground and the water coming in at a speed from the mountain we are in the early stages of dealing with the flood at the moment trying to make sure roads are safe for people and then we will concentrate on repairs
6376417 we were lucky in a sense that not many houses in the area were flooded and when the waters subsided damage to property was minimal
6376418 the fire brigade pumped that water out and then the cars were able to be removed
6376419 we thought things would change but now we have been pushed to the wall they treat us like we are nobody
6376420 asylum seekers are people who have suffered and then we come here and are still suffering and that is unacceptable
6376421 it is important that harmonious situations exist in these centres
6376422 i hope that senior officials from the dept of justice will visit the centre at the earliest opportunity to meet with representatives of the residents with a view to resolving the situation harmoniously
6376423 until a permanent and adequate solution which could be humanly recognised is provided for us
6376424 the rain just bucketed down thankfully it was during the day and we had a say in what happened i dont want to think what would have happened if it had occurred during the night
6376425 its a constant worry for me every time theres a little drop you wonder is it going to lead to another flood people say to me why dont i move but this is my home why should i move
6376426 the council have the money and an opw engineer has examined the river and described it as being very neglected he added that a lot work to be done
6376427 they believe it may affect the pearl mussels in durrow on the river nore
6376428 it is up there as one of the toughest games played in terms of emotions and obviously we are bitterly disappointed about the result
6376429 en una sociedad desarrollada y con esto me refiero a desarrollada como eeuu inglaterra jap n no como espa a al menos de momento los ingenieros inform ticos son los que se encargan de que la gente se comunique pueda tomar conciencia colectiva compre sepa cual es el estado del tr fico pague c modamente est segura son el suelo sobre el que se apoyan el resto de pilares

6376433 a neighbour rang me up at 9am to say that it was in the yard and getting close to the door at 10 oclock we received another call saying it was right up in the door we received a call from neighbours then at 1 30pm as they were putting the furniture up the stairs when we came home they had the generators running and 99 of the work was done they went above and beyond the call of duty
6376434 once off initiatives aimed at improving service for the families of those who misuse drugs
6376435 its important to remember that when someone misuses drugs it is not just they who suffer but their family as well
6376436 the grass roots of the game is the life blood of the sport and its fantastic to see the enthusiasm of the kids they are so many distractions these days with video games and everything that its more important than ever before they can take up sport and have fun with it
6376437 its huge for the kids to have a fellow like paul come along and give advice
6376438 he was teaching us how its important to keep your head when taking a shot stuff like that it was great to have him give us a bit if advice
6376439 ive been coming here for seven years its good fun and it gets you out and playing soccer
6376440 my sister was on her own here and i was on my own over there it made sense to come back and it was the right decision to make at the time in ireland i think there is a better attitude towards the elderly
6376441 shes a very independent personality shes extremely energetic as just loves company
6376442 the trucks are going on the pathway which is totally illegal in the first place in september we will have over 100 people and children on that road its a recipe for disaster i know the amount of money thats been put into the construction of the motorway but the loss of one single life is not worth the money
6376443 we have no problem with the county council or the truck drivers but we do have concerns with the safety of locals especially on the mountrath road the road is too narrow and at one stage you can count 75 trucks passing you on the stretch of road in just an hour
6376444 an elderly lady was going into town with a message bag on her right shoulder the truck came right up on the footpath and her bag got caught in the wheels she was completely oblivious to it and so was the driver he was looking out his right side but wasnt looking at all on his left hand side she fortunately managed to come away from it
6376445 from september there will be 140 children using this road for school along with cars and buses parked along the road no way is the road large enough for it
6376446 she had to leap into a doorway at the side of paddy moneys if she wasnt a young teenager i dont know if she would have been able to do it
6376447 when they drop their load some of them dont close it if theres some load left in the trailer its very dangerous as it could drop anytime on the road

6376455 in de historoscoop staat de geschiedenis van limburg en het rijnland centraal een gemeenschappelijk verleden dat gekenmerkt wordt door grenzen landsgrenzen natuurlijk maar ook symbolische grenzen grenzen door machthebbers op de landkaart gezet grenzen die we zelf als mens trekken grenzen die vervagen en verdwijnen om ergens anders opnieuw te worden bepaald het is voor het eerst dat zo prominent grensoverschrijdende geschiedenis een plaats krijgt in een museum
6376456 i woke up like seven times last night just thinking about it but im delighted to get it and have it over with

6376459 everyone here was equally determined as we were all here for the same thing getting the leaving cert the teachers have done so much for us and focused on the exams themselves it worked really well for us
6376460 we had a 100 pass rate in maths which bucks the nation trend and also in business studies
6376461 its not like it was 20 years ago there are plenty of options out there for young people and there is no reason they should panic you can for example get into a business course in dit through a post leaving certificate if you dont get the points on the day
6376462 we are very pleased with the results this year by and large the students are very happy with their marks well have students that will be going on to do post leaving certificate courses into the work force and on to third level
6376463 ill miss it without question but im looking forward to life after work

6376572 le choix dune pr sence plus importante de la france tait indispensable et justifi mais en m me temps nous devons avec nos partenaires europ ens apporter une valeur ajout e il sagit de trouver une meilleure r ponse aux enjeux civiques sociaux et conomiques de ce pays
6376573 il est hors de question de nous retirer sous la pression mais il faut sinterroger sur la strat gie
6376574 la de sarkozy de vouloir r int grer la ligne de lotan est une politique n gative
6376575 en afghanistan ce nest pas en apportant de nouvelles troupes que nous allons r soudre le probl me mais en faisant en sorte quil y ait les moyens de la reconstruction de ce pays

6376586 he danced for us in the introduction he danced for us at the end i mean he put on a show to me hes just like michael phelps
6376587 because ive walked by and ive heard guys who are a little disappointed in the way he acts in front of the camera
6376588 this guy has worked his tail off everyday on his knees throwing up in practice
6376589 he deserves to dance if you think its disrespectful work harder so you can be the one dancing
6376590 im serious he bought my nuggets because i didnt really want to go to the cafeteria i came straight to the track and my masseuse again bought me more nuggets and i just had two though because my coach said i should not eat so many nuggets before a race
6376591 he enjoys the moment that inspired michael johnson to run fast why cant that inspire usain bolt
6376592 it makes me think that people dont believe in hard work anymore i mean s t if you work hard you can achieve things
6376593 i talked to the prime minister he told me that everything in jamaica is blocked off
6376594 we have some of the best coaches in the world
6376595 theyre qualified at all levels in all disciplines you name it 100m 50m hurdles high jump we take every event seriously
6376596 but i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6376597 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6376598 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6376599 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6376600 to me i dont feel like hes being disrespectful if this guy has worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice he deserves to dance
6376601 at this early stage we believe he had fallen from a block of flats one line of inquiry officers are investigating is that the boy may have been chased prior to the fall
6376602 we believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification and confirmation that all next of kin have been informed
6376603 i am quite famous and hard of hearing please can you arrange for an escort for me at the other end
6376604 hes done his time its time to leave him alone alastair alicante spain

6376618 datenmissbrauch ist kriminell und durch bestehende gesetze bereits verboten und sanktioniert die regelungen zum datenmissbrauch sind im bundesdatenschutzgesetz unmissverst ndlich dargelegt und dar ber hinaus bereits jetzt sehr konsequent

6376620 es geht jetzt darum l sungen zu finden die tats chlich geeignet sind kriminelles tun zuk nftig noch nachhaltiger zu verhindern
6376621 wir k nnen es nicht zulassen das kriminelle die wirtschaft und verbraucher besch digen als vorwand dazu dienen kundeninformation und werbung zu untersagen wir vermissen entschieden eine differenzierte und der situation angemessene darstellung
6376622 there is still work to do but were making really good progress

6376624 what my presence can do is to identify any final obstacles
6376625 its a chance for me to sit with the prime minister and really get a sense of if there is anything else we need to do from washington to get to closure
6376626 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe can be done whats feasible
6376627 nobody wants to get to the withdrawal point prematurely where the iraqis cant handle it but were close on all these issues

6376629 isso me surpreendeu porque ao inv s das pessoas chamarem de cultura art stica chamam de nossa casa todo mundo usa essa palavra e foi uma descoberta ver o carinho que as pessoas t m por aquele local
6376630 ainda est muito quente a id ia seria manter ele o painel l mas vai precisar de uma reforma a firma que produz as pastilhas se colocou disposi o o painel est n tido se voc passar na frente do teatro tem a impress o que n o aconteceu nada toda a parte frontal parece s lida

6376667 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain
6376668 the results of this study revealed that the alexander technique can help back pain it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving co ordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6376669 this means that patients can have fewer activities or functions limited by back pain

6376688 since the prosecution has failed to provide reasonable evidence why the accused should not be granted bail the court therefore hold that the accused be granted bail

6376692 the rule of law and the challenges of law enforcement
6376693 the police as law enforcement agents are therefore the direct agents of economic development since there is incontrovertible basis for the assertion that an economically developed economy and society could lead to lesser levels of crime so it is in the interest of the police to ensure that they not only directly work within the parameters of the law but also encourage the achievement of the rule of law
6376694 this year a newspaper put on a concert where tables cost n10 million and no one blinked an eye then why should they now
6376695 we never said we were going to donate money for the campaign
6376696 we paid for the hall and the entertainers and the surplus we said would be spent on advertisements aimed at persuading nigerians to tell their relatives in america to register to vote
6376697 there is not one nigerian who doesnt have a relative or friend in america our aim was to encourage those people to tell their family who have the right to vote in america to vote for obama
6376698 we want to make it clear that the event and this organisation are in no way associated with obama for america of the democratic national committee should this organisation seek to place additional advertisement in your paper

6376700 people who did not know thought that they just woke up one morning to review the promotion no they went through the whole hog by perusing the record of these police officers who were promoted a whole committee sat and deliberated on the exercise it was not a one man affair

6376709 faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear
6376710 dear brother mueller im writing this because i am so weak in faith
6376711 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
6376712 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
6376713 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
6376714 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
6376715 one desire has been the ruling passion of my life one high motive has acted like a spur upon my mind and soul and sooner should i seek escape from the sacred necessity that is laid upon me let the breath of life fail me it is this that in spite of all worldly opposition gods holy ordinances shall be established again in the home in the school and in the state for the good of the people to carve as it were into the conscience of the nation the ordinances of the lord to which the bible and creation bear witness until the nation pays homage again to god
6376716 these results are not only the best we have ever achieved but this is the third year in a row that over 80 per cent of our young people have gained such a high standard
6376717 what is even more encouraging is the 74 per cent of pupils gaining five or more passes at grades a c including english and maths which is the figure the dcsf place so much emphasis on pupils and staff have worked hard together to achieve this outstanding level of success
6376718 our success is based on the principle that pupils do well when they feel safe and happy and have the opportunities to grow into confident responsible and empowered young people which is what st michaels is all about
6376719 these results are evidence of our continuing upward trend and are testimony to the hard work and commitment of pupils and staff and the support of parents
6376720 as you would expect from our specialism we have had exceptional results in science
6376721 were particularly pleased that our decision to introduce gcses in single sciences something not offered by many other high schools has been backed up by an impressive pass rate
6376722 the national gap between the two sets of figures is usually around 10 per cent
6376723 the fact that ours is so narrow shows so many of our students are really achieving the core targets
6376724 these results are the best in the colleges history i am absolutely delighted they are a real tribute to the dedication of the staff the commitment of our students and the backing of the parents
6376725 we are absolutely thrilled with this set of results which follows a wonderful achievement of 81 last year congratulations to all pupils parents staff and governors who have worked so hard to bring the school to this standard
6376726 we are so proud of our pupils and our school and continue to provide a superb all round education these results follow a wonderful ofsted report in march when we were judged to be an outstanding catholic school
6376727 i am delighted that our pupils continue to achieve the highest grades and that every pupil is leaving our school with at least one qualification
6376728 our results demonstrate the hard work of our pupils and staff and the support of parents it is good to know that this has been rewarded i would like to congratulate them all on their achievements

6376740 deshalb muss das bundesgesetz zur finanzierung der krankenh user unverz glich auf den weg gebracht werden um die tarifsteigerungen in die refinanzierung einzubeziehen und den sanierungsbeitrag von 0 5 prozent abzuschaffen und vor allem m ssen endlich gleiche preise f r gleiche leistungen in den krankenh usern gezahlt werden durch eine schrittweise angleichung der landesbasisfallwerte

6376769 alleen wie door een verwonding langere tijd niet kan werken inkomsten misloopt en kan aantonen dat de rotterdamse stadvervoerder aansprakelijk is voor het letsel kan met succes schade claimen aldus lsa voorzitter peter langstraat letselschadeadvocaat in rotterdam
6376770 tenzij ze met eigen onderzoek kunnen aantonen dat een derde zoals de ret daarvoor verantwoordelijk kan worden gesteld als slachtoffer moet je dus zelf het gebrek aan de apparatuur bewijzen de hoogte van de vergoeding hangt af van de geleden schade

6376793 traditional chemotherapy for stage iv nsclc still yields disappointing results and my hope is that this trial will improve the natural history of the disease
6376794 the statistics for global lung cancer deaths are staggering i am confident that this phase iii trial will establish lucanix r as a viable treatment option for patients with this dreaded disease
6376795 we saw virtually no side effects in the patients treated in phase ii trials based on our previous trial results we think lucanix r may lead to a significant advancement in patient care we look forward to continuing to enroll patients in this very important clinical study
6376796 we are delighted to have been selected as one of the major centers to test this highly promising immunotherapeutic approach to treating individuals with nsclc

6376812 this is the first time were looking at the k 12 response
6376813 as educators we are aware of the impact bullying has on children
6376814 our primary goal is to make sure the school environment is healthy and conducive to learning for all children
6376815 to get at things that affect kids over a lifetime such as persistent name calling
6376816 that will leave some kid excluded and some kid the target i would argue that nobody has to go through that
6376817 until someone makes you aware of what to look for you dont know the signs
6376818 theyve had to deal with things in their lives that i will never see theyve had murders and drug addictions and all of this loss but they are so resilient
6376819 we have to partner with other organizations because the federal money just doesnt go very far
6376820 shelters didnt want to bother with all of the red tape to get them enrolled school districts didnt want to deal with them and parents had so many problems they didnt want to deal with it
6376821 we make sure they have backpacks uniforms and school supplies
6376822 there have been several fires in the district and we know about them but we dont always know about a family losing a job unless someone tells us there are also kids who move out of their homes and live with friends because of problems within the family such as divorce drinking or drugs they try to escape these situations
6376823 if we find out the student is homeless we provide whatever services they need and we hook up many times with gail odorcich
6376824 the organizations will be able to court volunteers by presenting their needs then the volunteers decide
6376825 the daytime volunteer is still there but the numbers are not what they used to be
6376826 when people listen to what these organizations have to say they may be able to see some potential in themselves that they never thought about before
6376827 they are looking for things to do and have specific talents now that they have more time on their hands they want to share those talents
6376828 even if its just sending a greeting card it can be especially helpful for those residents who have little or no family

6376847 entscheidet sich der nutzer f r ein produkt wie viva mobile bei dem sms und mms sehr g nstig sind muss er sich auch der deutlich teureren minutenpreise von 18 cent ins festnetz bewusst sein diese liegen leider so gar nicht auf schn ppchenniveau

6376851 robinho never said that he is not happy at madrid but the fact is that he has a more interesting economic offer thats all

6376858 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6376859 it really demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife
6376860 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken 100 years to get from the balustrade to the house were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden

6376865 we are considering the implications of this judgment very carefully
6376866 we have never contested that mr mohameds defence lawyers should have access to information which would assist him in his defence in any trial at guantanamo bay
6376867 the court recognised the strenuous efforts that we have made to assist mr mohamed in guantanamo bay including efforts to ensure that the information hmg holds which relates to a small part of mr mohameds account of what happened to him is made available to him for purposes of his defence in any prosecution in the us system

6376907 for strong reasons of national security to which the court accepted we were entitled to give the highest weight we could not agree to disclose this information voluntarily
6376908 one of the most effective strategies we have developed during the course of the past two or three years in terms of obtaining a speedy and satisfactory resolution for us plaintiffs has been the threat or implementation of multi jurisdictional proceedings
6376909 for a european however the notion that there should be no safety net in place whereby the veracity of what is published as fact in the public forum can be monitored is very difficult to contemplate
6376910 served to discourage critical media reporting on matters of serious public interest adversely affecting the ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work
6376911 in the past anyone who could be classified as a public figure in the us has simply had to ignore these false and outrageous allegations being thrown at them in the tabloids
6376912 with the ever increasing expansion of internet publication and with us magazines such as the national enquirer now distributing uk irish editions i am being consulted more and more by internationally famous stars who would otherwise have difficulty in seeking vindication of their reputations in the us where the libel laws are geared much more in favour of the press
6376913 we have been working pretty closely together on georgia and issues related to afghanistan
6376914 the article he miliband wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are debates that all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in there is nothing in the article that is a problem because we have got to enter a debate with the other parties about the different futures for our country
6376915 we are getting on with the job look what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps these are the issues they want us to deal with you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6376916 nobody ever makes advance announcements on things like that but we are concentrating on the economic issues
6376917 they are very excited we have been watching on television it has been really exciting i dont think the british public expected that we would do so well and i think they are really delighted that we have
6376918 people are walking down state street and are probably not thinking about it
6376919 the marquees on broadway or in chicago are just so amazing and i thought that would be a neat task to take up
6376920 the whole idea was that it would be a fancy place to go
6376921 there were box seats there were places to be seen there was a smoking lounge downstairs there was a theory that people went to the theater and not to the movie
6376922 the projection room was the heart and soul of the theater
6376923 theres a lot of original stuff in there and it doesnt look that much different but it is a relic
6376924 i came home one summer and was on the balcony of mmoca there looked over here and thought the sign is so dilapidated it looks terrible
6376925 if people give money they know its for the sign

6377003 this is more about choice medical doctors will lay out all the courses of medical therapy that they believe will help but people were getting sick long before modern medicine came up with treatments
6377004 we believe many of the traditional natural treatments are just as worthy of consideration as complementary solutions to conventional medical treatments and we want to present those choices to consumers seeking cures and treatments so better decisions can be made based on better knowledge of alternatives with the final choice on what course of action to take up to them
6377005 tamir had a hard time getting to the people who knew what the possible alternatives were because there was no organized community
6377006 we address the issue of a treatments effectiveness in three ways first by building a community we open up lines of communications when a therapy is posted the entire community is encouraged to vote rate and comment so the treatments that have better chances of doing good are the ones that generate the most positive comment
6377007 second users can link the information they upload to other sites or blogs that contain additional information scientific studies health organization approval etc many of the therapies have been accredited in scientific studies and mamaherb gives those searching for alternative therapies a quick and easy way to get the full story on a therapy
6377008 one of the things we are planning to do is offer a marketplace for natural remedy ingredients which are also very hard for many people to find offering a place for users to find where to buy natural ingredients from as well as seeking professional opinion from experts on top of its huge database of information will help mamaherb cement itself as the major online alternative remedy information hub
6377009 we serve a vegetarian lunch to our staff every day plus we encourage doing sports and living a healthy and natural life
6377010 as a web 2 0 site we use all the new web tricks like rss online polls etc our aim is to make the site simple enough for non sophisticated users to benefit from while giving more savvy users all the tools they need to properly evaluate a therapy and determine how beneficial it will be
6377011 our attorneys make sure we tell all users to check out anything they read very carefully before actually doing something

6377299 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6377300 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6377301 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6377302 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6377303 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6377304 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6377305 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6377306 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6377307 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6377308 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6377309 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6377310 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6377311 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6377312 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6377313 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6377314 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6377315 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6377316 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6377317 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6377318 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
6377319 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
6377320 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
6377321 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
6377322 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
6377323 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
6377324 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6377325 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6377326 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6377327 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6377328 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6377329 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6377330 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6377331 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
6377332 if there is an opportunity to invest we will look at it
6377333 growing with our blue chip companies and our direct investment activities temasek now owns a net portfolio of about s 185 billion 131 billion at market value as at end march
6377334 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6377335 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6377336 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6377337 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6377338 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6377339 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6377340 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6377341 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6377342 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6377343 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6377344 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6377345 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6377346 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6377347 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6377348 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6377349 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6377350 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6377351 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6377352 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6377353 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6377354 we will use condoms where necessary people have the wrong conception that whatever homosexuals do is associated with hiv and aids but that is due to ignorance because there are a lot of things gays and lesbians do that do not expose one to the risk of contracting hiv and aids
6377355 as it is at the moment all our members are people born and bred in malawi
6377356 we are going to parliament to defend our mandate our problem is with the convening of parliament not the swearing in of members
6377357 if you convene parliament you are closing the door to negotiations
6377358 we have no idea when the negotiations will start but convening of parliament means they have no regard for the memorandum of understanding and not interesting in talking anymore
6377359 if we dont attend mugabes mps would choose the speaker and deputy we cannot boycott the sitting of parliament
6377360 we may vote on a particular issue with zanu pf or mdc tsvangirai but were not getting in partnership with one or the other
6377361 we are a distinct political party it is untrue that there was an informal agreement with zanu pf
6377362 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6377363 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6377364 he has been saying to me reinstating the judges minus one the one being the chief justice weve said its not a question of any individual its a question of the institution
6377365 if they are not restored it will be a bad day for democracy it means whatever the dictator did to our country we arent rectifying that
6377366 if this agreement is not fulfilled then how can we justify our stay in the coalition
6377367 members belonging to our party in the parliament asked asif to become the next president
6377368 there was an understanding between the coalition partners that the presidential candidate would be decided by mutual consensus
6377369 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6377370 its true that i have intervened in all fields in foreign affairs and in domestic libyan matters like development housing urban planning and so on
6377371 i have no more big battles to fight and my position is becoming embarrassing
6377372 the situation has changed if i carry on there will be a problem
6377373 frustration with the libyan bureaucracy which has slowed down the pace of his reforms
6377374 he is young and was hoping rapidly to make major progress but he ran into bureaucratic obstacles that he had not expected
6377375 i think that this is only a short term withdrawal that will pave the way for a new phase aimed at recasting his role in public life and giving it a legitimacy grounded in civil society
6377376 the 500 kilogrammes 1 100 pounds of tnt was found in plastic bags and was probably intended to be smuggled into the
6377377 the area they were in is covered in really jagged sharp rocks which were part submerged by the incoming tide and there was definitely no way back for them
6377378 i would not normally consider going anywhere near the wrangles but instinct just kicked in there were two young boys on the rocks who needed help and i knew my wetsuit would at least be some protection
6377379 we huddled together with my back to the wind and i kept them moving up the rock away from the incoming tide

6377383 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6377384 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6377385 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

6377388 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6377389 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6377390 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6377391 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6377392 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6377393 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6377394 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6377395 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6377396 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6377397 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6377398 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6377399 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6377400 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6377401 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6377402 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6377403 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6377404 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6377405 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6377406 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6377407 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6377408 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6377409 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6377410 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

6377416 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
6377417 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
6377418 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6377419 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6377420 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6377421 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6377422 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6377423 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6377424 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6377425 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6377426 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6377427 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6377428 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6377429 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6377430 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6377431 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6377432 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6377433 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6377434 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6377435 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6377436 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6377437 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6377438 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6377439 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6377440 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6377441 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6377442 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6377443 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6377444 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6377445 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6377446 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6377447 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6377448 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6377449 although oh deserved to win one will miss the african
6377450 we are pleased the university is pursuing an agreement that would make these records publicly available
6377451 everyone has kalashnikovs there because of the impact of the fighting in darfur and the south
6377452 because of that a small clash can build up very quickly
6377453 at least ten people most of them fighters were killed in the clashes which appear to be about control of the town
6377454 some of the dead bodies were only discovered on thursday morning
6377455 this is where an executive president has executive power and an executive prime minister has executive power and they have to share this power and they have to make decisions between themselves
6377456 some of them by consensus so that no one feels that they have been booted out of holding executive authority
6377457 the position to seek the speakers post is premised on the view that it is our party that wields the balance of power
6377458 i have decided no longer to intervene in state affairs
6377459 its true that i have intervened in all fields in foreign affairs and in domestic libyan matters like development housing urban planning and so on
6377460 i have no more big battles to fight and my position is becoming embarrassing
6377461 the situation has changed if i carry on there will be a problem
6377462 frustration with the libyan bureaucracy which has slowed down the pace of his reforms

6377464 i think that this is only a short term withdrawal that will pave the way for a new phase aimed at recasting his role in public life and giving it a legitimacy grounded in civil society

6377471 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6377472 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6377473 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6377474 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6377475 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6377476 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6377477 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6377478 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6377479 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6377480 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

6377482 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6377483 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6377484 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6377485 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6377486 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6377487 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6377488 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6377489 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6377490 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6377491 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6377492 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6377493 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6377494 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6377495 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6377496 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6377497 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6377498 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6377499 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6377500 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6377501 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6377502 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6377503 it will only be two weeks before you gain back all the weight you lost at camp
6377504 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6377505 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6377506 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6377507 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6377508 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6377509 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6377510 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6377511 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6377512 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6377513 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6377514 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6377515 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6377516 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6377517 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6377518 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6377519 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6377520 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6377521 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6377522 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6377523 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6377524 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6377525 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6377526 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6377527 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6377528 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6377529 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6377530 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6377531 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6377532 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6377533 all our farmers have capacity to earn sh20m annually as recommended by president museveni under the bonna bagagawale prosperity for all scheme these farmers are just lazy with hard work and regular monitoring they will be able to benefit from farming

6377549 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6377550 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6377551 vorig jaar hadden we er tussen de 300 000 en 350 000 als het weer vanavond goed blijft dan wordt het tussen de 350 000 en 400 000
6377552 we willen er werk van maken om in 2010 een kermis te hebben die twee weekenden lang duurt ideaal zou zijn als deze op een vrijdag begint en een week later op de zondag eindigt volgend jaar gaat dat nog niet lukken want daarvoor zijn al aan alle voorwaarden voldaan
6377553 bewoners die dit jaar op vakantie waren komen net terug en zeggen dat ze voor het geluid niet weg hoefden te blijven
6377554 kermis wordt hier gezien als een stuk cultuur en niet iets voor de gemeentelijke kas dat ze de ritprijs hebben verhoogd met maar veertig cent is schappelijk en het houdt de bezoekers echt niet weg
6377555 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6377556 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6377557 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6377558 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6377559 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6377560 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6377561 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6377562 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6377563 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6377564 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6377565 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6377566 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6377567 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6377568 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6377569 reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror

6377597 we knew that the chinese government is extremely repressive and that they might respond to any effort to get the word out about tibet strongly
6377598 so i have been stressed and worried but overall in the context of things what he is experiencing is pretty minor compared to what many people have at the hands of the chinese government

6377611 but with all the americans coming the party on the fourth outgrew the embassy
6377612 the last three of four years its been held at this large resort hotel on the edge of the city
6377613 the longer tenured americans have assimilated to a degree meaning they speak chinese fluently have actual chinese friends as opposed to language partners and can generally move comfortably in chinese society
6377614 but the majority are here just to make money or enjoy the ease of expat life they speak just enough chinese to get by binge on black market dvds when theyre not in the bars and seem generally content to bounce around in their various bubbles
6377615 theyre the kind of communities that could be set down anywhere
6377616 there are pizza huts and ben amp jerrys out there for them the people that live there are commuters who might not even know theyre in china
6377617 its true there are a lot of americans in sanlitun
6377618 but whats really american about it are all the bars ten to 12 years ago the only american style bars you could find were in the hotels now theyre all over the place
6377619 despite a lot of the anti authoritarian swagger amongst americans here
6377620 many still spend quite a few of their nights in the sanlitun drinking district which the government set up in the early days of the reform period to keep foreigners ghettoized and hence easy to monitor
6377621 ive been here over six years and it used to be the one thing that most americans missed was cheese

6377655 a key goal of nortel has always been to use technology to replicate the richness of a real world communications experience
6377656 the acquisition of diamondware strengthens nortels position in the converging telecommunications and it landscapes and gives us another building block to create the ultimate communications experience for our customers
6377657 diamondwares 3d voice technology will help give nortels customers a more natural and immersive communication experience whether theyre using it for traditional telephony and conferencing applications mobile unified communications or for web 2 0 virtual world environments
6377658 having had first hand exposure to both diamondware and web alive nortels web 2 0 virtual conferencing platform the natural synergies are clear
6377659 these are complex technologies that diamondware has been quietly mastering and will help nortel establish market leadership in what i see being the next wave of interactive communications

6377662 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
6377663 of course we are concerned about the fans however any disappointment from the core fans should not be directed toward fox what we are doing is seeking to enforce our distribution rights to watchmen legal copyright ownership should not just be swept under the rug and ignored
6377664 nortels r amp d and incubation teams are focused on creating revolutionary communications experiences to improve the way businesses interact with their employees partners and customers and web alive will be one very tangible example of that focus

6377847 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia he said
6377848 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6377849 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6377850 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it the brisbane lawyer said
6377851 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy

6377853 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill npws spokesman john dengate said
6377854 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle

6377856 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard mr dengate said
6377857 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work mr jenner said in a statement
6377858 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6377859 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6377860 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual

6377868 tom tell me how you went about developing the tools for the sql toolbelt 2008
6377869 i was taken into a little room at red gate by neil neil davidson joint ceo of red gate software in reality its our spare server room i sat on a small stool and neil sat on a slightly bigger stool and we argued about whether we should upgrade all our tools at the same time he was adamant that we were going to do sql server 2008 support so the plan was simple we would support sql server 2008 for all our tools there was also a couple of peripheral things we wanted to do and that was basically it there was much less to argue about than there would normally between marketing and product management and the different teams involved it was predominantly an engineering task and we would go ahead and execute it
6377870 do you think neils take on it was that sql server 2008 was going to be a stronger product than sql server 2005 and the fact that microsoft has invested a great amount of resources into sql servers 2008 it was bound to encourage people to invest in this rather than the sql server 2005
6377871 that might be the case obviously people will go towards better technology and skip to sql server 2008 rather than put money into 2005 it was just a gut feeling that this was the right thing to do we have a range of sql server tools which we package together in the sql toolbelt and we really wanted to be able to say to our customers that the toolbelt was now our predominant product you get eleven tools its completely intuitive easy to use and the price is brilliant and it cuts out any confusion for customers
6377872 would you say that developing sql server 2008 was technically or logistically more difficult than sql server 2005
6377873 when we had sql server 2005 there werent so many tools there are 11 products with sql server 2008 and so we knew that to get all the products developed and launched at the same time say in july was going to be a much more significant task and consequently the project would take longer
6377874 i think it was logistically more difficult rather than technically more difficult because we wanted to standardize on one version of the different libraries which went to all our products so we had the same copy of sql compare engine in everything and if we used any third party products we wanted to have version of the licensing because what happened in the past is that we ended up with these slight mismatches which meant that it bloated our installer so it was bigger because it had to have all these different versions in this release has managed to reduce the size of our installer by around ten per cent its not something thats massively important but its a nice thing to achieve it means that when people buy our products we know that if they find a bug in our licensing or in any other part of the release its going to be in all our products so achieving uniformity was a good goal to have
6377875 how does the toolbelt save time in restoring damaged or missing data from a back up can you give an example
6377876 has the sql toolbelt been successful it must be handy for dbas and developers to see all the tools they need in one place for a one off price
6377877 it has been very successful recently weve changed the pricing structure so customers can buy all our products in a single installer for under 2000 995 or a one off price of around 2500 1244 for support and upgrades it has simplified our offering so theres little potential for the customer to get confused now it came to this by thinking that our message was getting a little murky so we took some of the individual products and created the sql toolbelt simplification has been a great success the pricing is right and people can see that theyre buying something that has great value
6377878 what difference would it had made to you if microsoft had put sql server 2008 out say 2 months early how much pressure would that have given you to speed things up
6377879 i dont think it would have affected us that much actually because we were concentrating on supporting sql server 2008 and not adding the other features but in the end we had plenty of time and we are able to support all the smaller features in any case
6377880 we might have had to stagger our release and might have to release one of the products first then fill in all the smaller products that was my original concern that main product would go out then wed fill in with the others but as it happened we had finished a week before microsoft launched sql server 2008 it was quite tight to get them all ready
6377881 at the end of the day we had sql toolbelt 2008 ready 2 or 3 months ago but there was a lot of testing to do finalize that everything was working ok
6377882 some developers and dbas have been saying that they are having difficulties in some versions of 2008 that they were quite buggy in places what difficulty did you have in the builds from microsoft there were also problems with trying to download sql ctp build server 2008 and attempting to install it on a machine with visual studio 2008 already installed
6377883 actually they were significantly better than the betas we were getting for sql server 2005 yes they had bugs but on the other hand i think it was a massive help for us that we were able to get reasonably good builds from microsoft before final release especially in the interim second part of the development cycle
6377884 i remember that our installer broke because microsoft had tweaked something in their installer which stopped ours from working
6377885 but then its perfectly understandable that microsoft has the right to develop their own tools and change them if they are not working properly for us that means changes to something and because microsofts changes are not documented there is quite a lot of work we need to support the new versions but its a good challenge to have
6377886 one of the dangers that might happen over the next couple of weeks is that they would have changed things again which means we have to react rapidly to get things right for our customers
6377887 just how much time do you test the tools before release what processes do they go through
6377888 it is difficult to estimate the total amount of time spent on testing primarily because quality checking is part of the whole development process it starts with the team that works on our tools we have a one to one developer tester ratio and developers and testers sit next to each other during product development we use continuous integration and this helps to pick up problems early all of our projects have a large number of unit tests that run every night if there were changes to the source code for example over twenty thousand nightly unit tests ensure that there are no regressions in sql compare some problems cannot be automatically detected so there is a fair amount of manual testing involved in our development process these tests include install testing on many different platforms as well as user interface testing we also have many keen beta testers these people get early access to our products and with their help we can test our tools in environments and databases that would be difficult to reproduce locally finally the project team can delay the release of a product until they are absolutely satisfied with the quality
6377889 has the sql server management studio ssms got the native intellisense in it
6377890 sql server 2008 has intellisense in it and though microsoft produce it now its not as flexible as ours but its a difficult piece of technology to get right and weve spent several years perfecting it to get it where it is now
6377891 what difference will intellisense in sql server 2008 make to the customer
6377892 the intellisense in sql server 2008 is a good first attempt from microsoft it will do the basics people need for their every day work it is important to note though that microsofts intellisense works only with sql server 2008 databases so if you have any legacy sql server 2000 or 2005 databases you will not get intellisense in sql server so people will still need to rely on third party intellisense tools like our sql prompt sql prompt is certainly not endangered in the short term but even in the long term sql prompt will have its place it is basically the next level of intellisense a level that can support complex database schemata and a solution with plenty of customizations and tuning opportunities
6377893 i know microsoft had planned to include intellisense in sql server 2005 but pulled it from a beta release before they released the database to manufacturing why do you think they did that given that it was first introduced as a feature of a mainstream microsoft product in 1996 with the visual basic 5 0 control creation edition
6377894 intellisense for sql is a difficult technology to get right the language was certainly not designed with intellisense in mind for example a select statement requires the user to specify a few tables and the columns of these tables logically one would specify the tables first and then once the scope has been narrowed down one would choose the columns of the listed tables however the syntax of the select statement first lists the columns and only after these columns have been specified does the syntax require you to list the tables because the logical structure of queries does not follow the order of the query syntax most people will write their queries in a non sequential way first specifying the column sources i e the tables views and so forth and then go back in their editor to specify the columns this moving backwards and forwards is very much unlike the languages for which intellisense was available for before and certainly complicates intellisense solutions
6377895 sql server 2008 introduces a few new languages like welsh tibetan and norwegian while these new languages map to the codepages in windows server 2008 in earlier operating systems such as xp they fail to do are there simple workarounds does being multi lingual andras help you as a software architect
6377896 the short answer is that there are no simple workarounds the primary use for collations is ordering and comparing textual data sql server often makes use of the collation support of the underlying operating system and many of the new collations introduced in sql server 2008 rely on collations in windows server 2008 this does mean that a database that has been created on windows server 2008 and restored or migrated to a server with an earlier version of the operating system will stop working from the perspective of our tools the solution is similar to the solution we had for sql server 2000 and sql server 7 i e we have an extra option to ignore collation information while this may result in some performance degradation when comparing large amounts of data this is a solution that works concerning being multi lingual and how this affects my role as a software architect well there is not much to say it certainly helps to have experience with internationalized software however the majority of our products are available only in english we have experimented with shipping german and japanese versions of our tools but it looks like our customers who speak these languages still prefer the english version
6377897 how fast can you react to problems if someone finds a bug
6377898 we released all of our sql server tools with full support for sql server 2008 during july and so far no customer has found a single bug in any of the products in the unlikely circumstance that someone did hit an issue we could react in a number of different ways the response depends on how serious and also how widespread the problem is for a clear showstopper we would investigate immediately our aim would be to generate a reproducible scenario for the bug and then look to develop a fix once fixed we would retest the issue and any surrounding functionality we would also run any automated or overnight tests to try and ensure that no other functionality has been broken by the change next step would be to send the update to any customers that have run into the problem to check that we have actually fixed their specific issue once we have good confidence we would run our install tests and then make the release publicly available as part of the sql toolbelt
6377899 if the issue is less important or specific to an individual customer we may choose to deliver what we call a private release a private release is similar to patch but is delivered by our customer support team via an on demand service the private release should still fix the individual problem but we do not run such extensive tests around regressions or installations typically we can react with a private release in 1 2 days sometimes bugs are not considered important enough to warrant fixing immediately these are registered against the product and will be reviewed by the team typically such bugs get fixed during the next scheduled release of the product
6377900 would you say theres a one killer application for business in red gates sql toolbelt 2008
6377901 the toolbelt is a broad offering of 11 different sql tools as such i dont think it really makes sense to talk of one of the products as being the killer application however some products are now the industry standard for certain tasks sql compare has been around for 8 years and is widely seen as the way of comparing and synchronizing sql server database schemas anyone performing these migrations by hand is clearly missing out big time sql prompt is another tool with a massively broad appeal providing good intellisense for sql is a very difficult problem the popularity of the tool is testament to how well we are doing but there is more to come in sql prompt 4
6377902 i know everyone at red gate is closely involved in the business so people understand how the business works how do you think this dual role helps in developing software does it help you understand the needs of other businesses that much better
6377903 my view is that this has been key to the success of red gate so far as the company continues to grow it is becoming much harder to keep everyone especially newer team members engaged we do run regular remote usability session where whole teams watch customers or prospective customers work with the products they are writing this most definitely keeps everyones feet on the ground and can highlight problems that are obvious but only when youve watched someone struggle through an area of functionality red gate is trying to remain a very open and transparent company public displays and the intranet contain all the sales figures from the current day to day transactions all the way back to the very first piece of software sold product engineers are probably some of the most opinionated people at the company and they are at the heart of many involved discussions about what products we should build next or why a particular product or feature is doing well commercially one aspect that i have been pushing as key is keeping product teams in touch with customers after every major launch we try and call up people that have downloaded the new release typically the end user is pleased to chat once he realizes its not a sales call again these conversations can really help us to understand how people use our tools but also gives us an insight into how they view red gate as a whole

6377907 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity

6377939 the organisation which has about 70 local authorities from kenya uganda and tanzania has been mobilising local authorities to adopt the sustainable use of resource on lake victoria
6377940 the declining fish stock is a result of our failure fisheries authorities to introduce or limit access to the most exploited lakes victoria kyoga and albert this has given opportunists with special interests rather than economic rationale a chance to abusively exploit the fishery resources

6377988 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6377989 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6377990 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6377991 there were two points that differed from the preliminary game where cuba did very well on serve and reception
6377992 the us did it very well and we didnt they were very well prepared and played to their potential
6377993 my teammates had enough confidence in me to set me the ball to win the match and i was just thinking is this me did i just do that
6377994 we are very very close to an agreement but its not done
6377995 undoubtedly its true that the negotiators have taken this very very far towards an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement
6377996 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces will operate i think that is only natural at this point
6377997 i am not going into the details now where we are on in specific issues except to say i think all issues have moved forward in a positive way
6377998 we are continuing to work to make sure that any timeline aspirational timelines that are in the agreement really do reflect what we believe and what is reasonable
6377999 obviously i will also check progress on the negotiations on the strategic frameworks agreement and on an agreement to allow our forces to continue to operate in iraq after the expiration of the united nations security council resolution

6378033 our new category management organisation has brought together specialist teams which will provide top level expertise and successful delivery
6378034 we have also enhanced our procurement capability by developing internal skills and undertaking an extensive external recruitment programme
6378035 you destroy a people if you treat them with disdain
6378036 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6378037 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
6378038 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
6378039 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
6378040 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6378041 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6378042 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6378043 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
6378044 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
6378045 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
6378046 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6378047 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6378048 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun
6378049 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6378050 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6378051 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6378052 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6378053 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6378054 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6378055 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6378056 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6378057 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6378058 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6378059 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6378060 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6378061 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6378062 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6378063 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6378064 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6378065 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6378066 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6378067 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6378068 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6378069 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6378070 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6378071 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6378072 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6378073 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6378074 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6378075 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6378076 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6378077 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6378078 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6378079 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6378080 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6378081 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6378082 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6378083 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6378084 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6378085 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6378086 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6378087 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6378088 ha sido un milagro apenas tiene quemaduras est esperando para ser operado de las fracturas que sufri en el f mur y el tobillo
6378089 mi hijo ten a billete para un vuelo anterior de air europa pero lo cambi ayer mismo para volar un poco m s tarde ha sido una fatalidad
6378090 he perdido a mi hijo de 27 a os estoy destrozada
6378091 he perdido a mi hijo a mi nuera y a mis dos nietos

6378095 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6378096 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6378097 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6378098 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6378099 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6378100 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6378101 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6378102 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6378103 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6378104 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6378105 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6378106 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6378107 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6378108 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6378109 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6378110 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6378111 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6378112 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6378113 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6378114 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6378115 this is a planning took where all things are going
6378116 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6378117 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6378118 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6378119 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6378120 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6378121 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6378122 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6378123 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6378124 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6378125 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6378126 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6378127 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6378128 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6378129 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6378130 i dont want to go out with you youre not poor or ugly enough
6378131 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6378132 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6378133 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6378134 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6378135 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6378136 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6378137 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6378138 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6378139 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6378140 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6378141 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6378142 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6378143 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6378144 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6378145 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6378146 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6378147 brians contribution to the fa is hiring the worst england manager since graham taylor and following that up by giving the england job to somebody who could barely fucking speak english
6378148 and what does capello do pick exactly the same team that mcclaren picked my fucking gran could do that for 6 5 million quid a year and the daft old bat is dead we are even worse now than a pub team barwick can piss right off and take that stupid italo twat with him
6378149 we can take a lot of positives out of tonight we played well and i was as magnificent as i always am in an england shirt and i wont let anybody tell me otherwise
6378150 decentralised management of the protected areas in the leopard habitat made it impossible to implement a unified program for leopard restoration over many years
6378151 moreover protection of red list species which includes the far eastern leopards did not fall under the remit of any of the other agencies
6378152 this announcement marks the culmination of five years of hard work by wwf
6378153 this is a real opportunity for the leopard population in the region to gain a foothold and pull themselves up from the brink of extinction
6378154 any construction in the region should take into consideration the fragile state of this leopard population
6378155 activities undertaken should in no way threaten the existence of the species
6378156 cardioecg 3 2 represents the next wave electrocardiograph data management interoperability between multiple vendors and devices flexibility and support for both single hospitals and multi site facilities and straightforward web enabled access all combine to streamline the collection and management of ecg data delivering superior roi from clinical administrative and it standpoints
6378157 our two key demands have already been fulfilled therefore the supreme majlis of the party decided to take part in the elections and nominated me for the presidential elections
6378158 these two obstacles have been eliminated two days ago the state committee for property management provided us with headquarters though our headquarters needs repairs we already have our own headquarters as to the representation of the party in cec parliament will give a positive response to it in the autumn session
6378159 some parties have decided not to take part in the elections we decided to do so not to let the voters of opposition to support government and to use the support of these voters in favor of our party striving for the well being of azerbaijan
6378160 we will have enough time the election headquarters of our party and regional organizations are fully ready for the elections
6378161 you cant just throw people at all your problems dear
6378162 in cadrul unui turneu pe care il desfasoara in caucaz si in europa de est
6378163 nous avons choisi de mieux coordonner lensemble des services qui se consacrent ladoption
6378164 alors que nous avons pr s de 30 000 agr ments
6378165 sept cents cest tr s peu nous avons 23 000 enfants qui sont plac s par d cision judiciaire et qui ont un parcours dans des familles daccueil beaucoup trop long
6378166 jai d couvert un chiffre terrifiant qui nous disait que pr s de 40 des enfants qui taient pass s par la protection de lenfance avaient connu un parcours de sans domicile fixe
6378167 the kids at this club are starting to come good us getting relegated has helped
6378168 it sounds strange but it would be difficult to put julian kelly jem karacan in the premiership but you can give them a go in the championship
6378169 alex pearce will end up playing god knows how many games for this club
6378170 he is a great kid hes a leader of men
6378171 you also have gylfi sigurdsson and simon church coming through
6378172 the reserves beat an experienced southampton squad the other night and it bodes well for the future
6378173 there will be a time when we have four or five in the team and that can only be good for the academy and the club and the chairman will be happy because hes put a lot of money in the academy
6378174 i played with them the other night and everyone could make a living here they are very very good we have an exceptionally young team coming through and its great to see
6378175 to be fair to get into the first team is a hard job because we have a lot of internationals in the squad and players who have played in the premier league
6378176 its not going to be easy for any young player but i do really feel that the boys at this club can break into the first team
6378177 the boys worked so so hard on saturday it was because of that we got the corners that led to the goals they never stopped
6378178 on another day if stack hadnt been so good then lita would have got a couple of goals he made some great saves
6378179 they really are playing for the team and doing a great job i have to be patient so im just keeping my head down working hard and ill see what happens
6378180 to be fair shane is quite big and good in the air and i can win stuff in the air
6378181 i dont think the boys lost many headers i dont think the height is a big factor because we all have attributes we all have a good spring
6378182 although we didnt get the result we wanted we showed many positive signs
6378183 we were up against a very organised sunderland side who have a lot of experience at this level
6378184 were a young side but we started well and we kept possession well at times and created some chances
6378185 we have things to work on but we have a very good coaching set up at the club and they will make sure we will have the best opportunities to improve
6378186 i am sure we are capable of causing some upsets in the long season ahead
6378187 a substantial amount of the money went to cyprus where a deposit was put down on a property that fell through and the money was returned to this country while mcquisten was in custody
6378188 he refused to divulge what had happened to the cash which necessitated a lengthy investigation with requests having to be made to the cypriot authorities to trace the money trail
6378189 the whole investigation took some six months and when mcquisten hands over the cash it will be transferred to the royal bank of scotland which reimbursed prodat systems plc
6378190 you spent the money on unnecessary luxuries this was a gross breach of trust for which only custody is justified
6378191 i bear in mind as a result of your dishonesty you have destroyed your marriage lost your home and your career and all these are significant punishments in themselves
6378192 we found someone we believed to be more suitable for the job
6378193 its imperative that teachers work with school administrators to bring the kids those real world applications into the classroom
6378194 people in neighborhoods have to start watching for the kids
6378195 parents could get together and actively put together a group that really takes responsibility for safety
6378196 im very sad and disappointed to leave but its obviously time for a new chapter at the football association
6378197 each different subject has a paper thats right for it
6378198 the resolution didnt come through the little black bird is blurred the human eye can see 14 to 15 stops of light a digital camera sees less than what film emulsion sees film is closer to what your eyes see another thing is grain grain in film provides good depth and texture

6378207 a knife can not effectively do what an axe or machete can do an axe can not effectively do what a knife or machete can do but a machete can do most of what an axe can do and all of what a knife can do
6378208 the ultimate thing would be to go 42 out there and win
6378209 its a fast track im ready to go well see thursday i just want to win whatever time i do i will be happy
6378210 i knew what i could do the races i lost i didnt execute the right way thats all ive got to do is execute and ill be fine
6378211 were here at the games its time to show down and throw down
6378212 the matchup between me and him theres other athletes out there who can run just as fast as we can as you saw in the first round looks like its going to be a fast final no matter who makes it in there
6378213 i dont call him and say you want to go here or there
6378214 but the respect is there we know each others talent i know hes a great athlete he knows im coming he knows im great neither of us are poor sportsmen and both of us are american so love and respect is there
6378215 encouraging indigenous species helps stabilise earth and stems harmful sediment entering watercourses leading to bassenthwaite
6378216 while many textbooks and articles have created the myth that the internet protocols were designed for warfare environments the top level goal for the darpa internet program was the sharing of large service machines on the arpanet
6378217 as a result many protocol specifications focus only on the operational aspects of the protocols they specify and overlook their security implications
6378218 in many cases vendors have implemented quick fixes to protocol flaws without a careful analysis of their effectiveness and their impact on interoperability
6378219 some customers have told us they want to be able to run windows server and linux together seamlessly but in many cases they need help with the transition to suse linux enterprise server from other linux environments
6378220 it contains some of the most weird and eccentric labour saving devices ever thought up by the imagination of people hoping to strike it rich by their creation
6378221 in just one week maurice and his collection was featured on radio 2 twice radio four richard and judy sky news bbc news 24 bbc radio cumbria and in the daily mail
6378222 this coverage has resulted in visitor figures to keswick museum increasing markedly on the day maurice was interviewed on radio 4 museum staff were inundated with enquiries about the exhibition and visitor numbers shot up to 260 for that day
6378223 if terria wins the bid the very first thing i will do is contact telstra chairman donald mcgauchie or telstra ceo sol trujillo and offer them an equity shareholding in our company
6378224 the only reason i would do that is because we want the network to service the whole of the industry on equal terms and i think telstra investing as an equity owner would give the assurance that the network was being operated fairly
6378225 under our bid the major equity owner would be the commonwealth government we will then fund the build with a mix of equity investment and debt after that it will just be a matter of working out what the most efficient capital structure is
6378226 terria would give telstra as big a share as they wanted so long as they wont be able to control the consortium
6378227 telstra would be like any other equity owner in the consortium who has an interest in making sure the network was properly run but not able to influence the outcomes in their favour or to a disadvantage to the other equity holders
6378228 if the business case of this 8 shelf company terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board
6378229 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6378230 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards telstra has made absolutely clear that if it builds the nbn it will provide open and equivalent access to everyone
6378231 the nbn project marks the biggest infrastructure investment in the countrys history it has enormous potential to benefit the nation if it enhances competition but if it shuts down competition which it could to do then it has enormous potential to be a disaster
6378232 we believe particularly because there is so much taxpayer money in this project that the first areas to be serviced should be those that are currently underserviced
6378233 it looks like someone has been having fun with the dumper truck
6378234 i have worked here for 22 years and i have never seen anything like this before it is unbelievable
6378235 we think it was a large machine similar to a jcb it happened overnight to a large area
6378236 it was random they didnt attack just one area but went all around the course
6378237 it was an act of vandalism it is the first time we have had something on this scale the mature trees were about 20 years old they are flattened and cut up how do you put a value on damage to mature trees
6378238 we think it was a six ton dumper truck taken from one of the sites for the new bypass
6378239 it will take a few weeks to clean up the damage
6378240 we are asking people to take care around the plantations because some of the trees are leaning
6378241 the vandals didnt come around the club house way if they had then the steward and stewardess who live in the bungalow would have seen them they came at the bottom of the site there is a ditch there to stop cars getting onto the site but it wouldnt stop a dumper truck going through
6378242 the vandals had driven over the trees uprooted them and driven on top of them to flatten them they are a foot in diameter but they have been rammed until they fell down and the bark came off them
6378243 i have written to the planners expressing my opposition on those grounds if carlisle is to expand that is the logical place for such development to take place a windfarm would detract from that
6378244 if you fly above the m6 motorway then it becomes obvious how little development there is to the east of it around carlisle the area close to junction 42 is an obvious place for industry to want to locate and that is important for the future prosperity of the city
6378245 i am relieved that we are not seeing wholesale closures and changes in dumfriesshire
6378246 there are a number of changes where outreach or partner services are being introduced and i am looking to hear the views of people in eskdalemuir and bentpath on the proposed changes which affect them
6378247 the changes in my constituency involve a change in service from sub postmasters postmistresses to outreach services generally accompanied by a reduction in hours and a change of venue for service delivery
6378248 eskdalemuir will move to the former school building and will offer a service between 11 30am and 1 30pm every tuesday
6378249 bentpath which currently averages two transactions a week will be offered a home service
6378250 i think they are totally mad but thank goodness for that
6378251 i think it was a spur of the moment thing for them they are really pleased with what they have achieved
6378252 all i can say is that to do it in nine days 100 miles a day is fantastic
6378253 the bikes are part of our fitness and training it was really good and i thoroughly enjoyed it i have never done anything like that before certainly never ridden 100 miles in one day
6378254 i think it excelled our expectations by a long way
6378255 we had a brilliant time and we laughed more than we ever thought it was a good challenge waking up every day knowing we had got 100 miles to do it was also brilliant for my training for the rallying
6378256 it is close to a lot of peoples hearts in rallying richard was a brilliant inspiration to me when i was starting out
6378257 michael park was a guy i used to speak to for help he was a really good friend and the death of him was in the same year we had our accident

6378427 the main stumbling block to concentration is the inevitable distraction we get from our own thoughts it is random uninvited thoughts that distract us from achieving pure concentration the only solution is learning to control and quieten our thoughts the first thing to be aware of is that we do have the choice to welcome or reject thoughts we should not feel a helpless victim of our own mind the second thing is we need to consciously watch our thoughts and prevent ourselves following any train of thought that detracts from our concentration if we casually begin a project it is easy to begin daydreaming and lose focus what we need to do is be very determined to concentrate without distracting thoughts when we have this intention and determination it becomes much easier to concentrate
6378428 concentration must be learned practiced and developed like any other skill get yourself in a regular pattern of concentrating find a consistent time during the day when you feel comfortable that you wont be interrupted and that your energy level meets the demands of a particular task then on most days use that time to accomplish that task

6378438 it was interesting to find that amd hasnt promised any performance improvements yet we did see some in place wic performance is slightly up while ut3 performance under vista also seems to be up a little there are also extremely obvious gains under 3dmark vantage for the hd 4000 series cards it seems mainly that the latest driver release was all about bug fixes though as the list for fixes in both xp and vista are actually quite extensive it also seems clear that amd have adjusted their focus to the hd 4000 series of cards which doesnt really come as a surprise really the only thing we need to look at now is if crossfire gains are present but since the driver doesnt mention anything about it we would be surprised to see any gains apart from vantage perhaps what well do is place the hd 4870 x2 in our testbed along with a pair of hd 4870s in crossfire if we see some improvements that are worth mentioning we will be back with another performance analysis if we dont though well no doubt see a new set of drivers next month which will hopefully boost the performance of the newly released hd 4000 series cards

6378446 we did have some dates that had to go during the inspection period but it definitely has been worth the money spent on the inspection
6378447 were seeing a lot more locals taking advantage of this and staying closer to home
6378448 the lorena is a great piece to the puzzle of our local hospitality industry our hospitality folks do a great job of cross selling the lorena with places like the wilds the zane grey museum
6378449 we had 70 turnout for a public ride and i like to hold it to 60 but those 10 people they came back the next time when we had 50 lined up
6378450 its phenomenal really ive been doing this for about five years and its the first time ive had to turn them away
6378451 twilight cruises have been slow but we did have 44 people one time so it has been going well
6378452 working with other businesses in the community and having all of the sternwheelers thats what made marietta what it is
6378453 with buses coming in and having the lorena places like cottrills and hartstone pottery and the wilds were becoming a pretty decent tourist spot
6378454 similar to things they used to have around the zanes trace commemoration
6378455 if it gets too cool people wont ride and we would have to close her down but i would certainly do it its definitely something we would consider

6378472 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart he said
6378473 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6378474 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6378475 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity
6378476 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work shah said

6378483 because of the threat of potential harm to the students
6378484 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia he said
6378485 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6378486 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6378487 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it the brisbane lawyer said
6378488 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6378489 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves he said

6378502 you never feel completely comfortable in this ball park but with the wind blowing in today it made it a little easier to pitch to some of the tough guys in the middle of the order
6378503 youre not worrying about the ball going out of the park so easily
6378504 i think i didnt have a good position to the ball
6378505 he hit it on the end and i didnt have a very good jump on the ball
6378506 i thought stuff wise this was one of lillys better games of the year
6378507 i was put in a situation where i had an opportunity to get out of it looking back youd have liked to make a little better pitch to keppinger with two strikes on him

6378515 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever

6378530 most of the times we have played in lanka it is not a bowlers paradise especially for the fast bowlers full credit to the fast bowlers for coming out with flying colours in tough conditions they bowled in right areas
6378531 in the last two games seamers got help but they may not get these conditions in the coming three games
6378532 it was turning a bit also so it was a bit tough when in one end we had a batsman but in other end it was open with the tailenders of course it was a concerned area till the match got over
6378533 there are 45 people confirmed dead in the blast the number of injured is very high and we are right now collecting information
6378534 julys robust 0 8 percent monthly rise in retail sales should be taken with a pinch of salt given that the official sales data have been unusually volatile over the past few months

6378557 the jungle has the greatest biodiversity with thousands of species each occupying a specific niche
6378558 the only direct conflicts we saw were between two spiders and two monkeys fighting over the same niche the forest had three main levels first at the ground to 15m 15m 35m and the canopy above 35m
6378559 the occupants and action at the bottom of the forest are much different than those in the middle or top as in markets different techniques are needed at tops middles and bottoms
6378560 it is hard for one species of trader to hope to avoid death at all the levels it is very hard to start on the bottom of a market and survive to the top
6378561 extreme specialisation is the rule in the jungle there is no reason that same type of specialisation would not be required in the market however in many ways current markets lack real diversity
6378562 the correlation among markets has been a result of this lack of diversity
6378563 in the jungle there are small streams that caiman like to use one might use the flow direction to determine the direction of the larger river and follow that the obvious trade parallel is to follow the flow of the orders of the bid or ask
6378564 the tapir makes vague paths through undergrowth through habitual use there are meals for life in following well worn trading price paths habitually used in the market

6378599 mmmm well you are a thinker thats for sure perhaps the most important thing is to just be a good person i guess thats what god really wants us to do

6378613 it is proper for all those who fear god to constantly be in pain and worry over the destruction of the holy temple
6378614 any generation in which the holy temple is not rebuilt is held responsible for its destruction

6378805 australia tested us in the first half like they did in the last game in that exhibition
6378806 i think that out of all the teams that weve played so far they run their offense the best and i think they do a good job of really moving the ball setting a lot of screens back screens and trying to get you to fall apart with the 24 seconds
6378807 i think thats why they stood around so much as opposed to other teams we played when we get out early and get steals and things like that they break apart a little easier than australia does australia their coach does a great job of keeping them together try to keep them running their offense theyre very versatile theyve got bigs theyve got shooters theyve got drivers other teams have one or the other i think them and argentina are the two teams that have a little bit of everything to where you have to be solid on defense
6378808 the toughest part is trying to come in and really respond and help the team in any way you can especially for the guys who are starters in this league and havent really experienced coming off the bench
6378809 this is obviously a surprise but we know whats at stake and obviously the caliber of guys that we have we just have to be ready and i think today i was ready i think in the games i have been ready whether its shooting the basketball or playing some defense or doing whatever so ive just got to continue to stay ready

6378911 i mean im excited and have an unbelievable feeling inside but overall it hasnt sunk in its incredible
6378912 i really thought i was going to need at least 10 pounds on sunday to win
6378913 it was a struggle and it started to get to me a little bit
6378914 i need a big bag im going to where i think i can catch a big fish
6378915 we tried to play too much football though and pass pass pass not get in behind which is what they did and we were punished for it
6378916 you have to be defensive sometimes in this league which is something they perhaps dont understand yet ledesmas a young lad and theres already a few ball players like him in the team such as hogan ephraim and lee cook
6378917 you have to earn the right to play its important to have people tracking back which is something the new lads are not used to but they work hard in training and theyll learn
6378918 we had a lot of the ball at united and on it we did well from a neutral point of view it was good but from the managers point of view they didnt work hard enough sheffield united is not an easy place to go and you need to put out a side that can battle and get a result
6378919 mikele leigertwood tracked all the time and once they do that sort of thing itll be better
6378920 itll be a shock going to places like blackpool on a tuesday night you get games like those but as long as they learn from them thats all that matters
6378921 the gaffer pulled me to one side and told me i was the best player against barnsley but that he was going to keep the same midfield that ended the first league match
6378922 he wanted to keep the same system and pass united off the park i wasnt happy one minute im captain on the opening day and then im dropped but thats football
6378923 hes a top top coach as a bloke and as a coach he is great for this football club and will prove that given time
6378924 the people ive spoken to tell me they like to get the ball down and pass it
6378925 they play attacking football and the momentum from last season has carried into this one as often happens
6378926 you hear about other clubs expectations like birmingham but we dont think about it weve a new squad with a new manager and new ideas
6378927 we just need to work hard to get results and gel the new lads in

6378931 brown fat can increase energy expenditure and protect against obesity
6378932 the epidemic of obesity closely associated with increases in diabetes hypertension hyperlipidemia cancer and other disorders has propelled a major interest in adipose cells and tissues

6378991 its the first ranking tournament of the season so everyone will be a bit rusty but im looking forward to it because its a good opportunity to get off the mark early
6378992 if i win in the first round then i have to play ronnie osullivan so that should be interesting and thats one ill certainly look forward to
6378993 my ranking tournaments were pretty bad and i was unlucky in the masters when i lost 6 5 to mark selby in the semi finals and in the final to shaun murphy in malta but the rest of the ranking tournaments were pretty crap
6378994 to be honest i ran into a lot of players who played really well against me
6378995 for instance the chinese guy liang wenbo played brilliantly against me in the world championships so what do you do
6378996 i didnt play to the standard that im capable of so its my own fault and i have no cross to bear i didnt play well and i suffered because of it
6378997 to be honest its not for the lack of practice whether i overdid it or not im not quite sure but i cant do the same this year as i did last year and expect results
6378998 its the first sign of madness when you keep doing the same things over and over again and arent getting anywhere looking for different answers so ill have to change and do something different and see what happens
6378999 i have to go back to the drawing board and work at something different with my game to try and compete with these guys because im not getting ay younger
6379000 there are a lot of guys breaking through and its getting tougher and tougher its very easy to slide down if you throw in the towel but im not one for doing that i never was and i never will be
6379001 its a game i love and im just going to keep playing it as long as i can and keep enjoying it thats the main thing i love the challenge thats why being out of the top 16 i know its going to be difficult but its a challenge

6379003 pharmacies are usually the first port of call for patients and its more cost effective and easier to visit a pharmacy than your gp
6379004 we have up to 20 requests each day for coughs and colds treatment alone and its very hard to say no but recently weve had to turn patients away
6379005 the way this new scheme is structured is fundamental to its success and our customers health
6379006 we have supported the pcc in this because we believe it is the right thing to do
6379007 we are looking to them to ensure that our interests are looked after
6379008 i understand that the government has to make firm decisions on how the pharmacy scheme will fit into the quality management of the medical service but the issue needs discussion and negotiation
6379009 it has been argued that we can just sell medicines to these patients over the counter without providing advice or consultation but this can be expensive for our customers and isnt always what they want
6379010 giving patients the best treatment we can is the reason the old scheme was introduced in the first place and pharmacists need space for chronic disease management as well as providing medicines
6379011 we are aware that some contractors have concerns with the remuneration model offered however the opportunity to provide feedback after a six month period of operation is built into the offer and the minister would urge contractors to deliver the enhanced service and bring their views back to the department at that stage
6379012 the enhanced service remains open to contractors and we would encourage those who have opted out to reconsider
6379013 the new service provides better access to treatment for patients gives pharmacists an increased level of remuneration and ensures the pharmacy economy will benefit from the injection of substantial new money
6379014 concerns have also been raised about the use of test purchasers however contractors should note that as indicated to pcc test purchasers will only be used should there be any indication of misuse or deviation from the service criteria
6379015 credible evaluation of a new service is essential for any government department and we hope that we can work with the profession in agreeing a suitable model
6379016 this is a man who was allegedly involved in a substantial drugs transaction the thought of him going to corfu having been involved on such a scale is something the public would have concerns about

6379076 we are not listening to what people say about us being red hot favourites we are keeping our shoulders to the wheel and trying to get on with our preparations we know that we need to step up even further if we are to reach the all ireland final against either kerry or cork
6379077 everything is moving in the right direction i have received intensive treatment on the injury and its coming along nicely theres no doubt that i will be 100 per cent for the semi final
6379078 we are now in the last four and looking forward to it we will once again be the underdogs but weve already beaten two ulster sides down and reigning provincial champions armagh it will be a huge day and one that i will not miss
6379079 its going to be a challenge to get the boys on the right wavelength
6379080 there is a danger that maybe our players thought that reaching a leinster final was good enough on the day something was wrong
6379081 wed still talk about what went wrong in that dublin game what was it that we did before the dublin game that we want to avoid before this game with tyrone
6379082 in previous years wexford hadnt reached a leinster final so when youre there maybe there is a sense that youve reached your target
6379083 the players upped their performances though for the down and armagh games and theyll have to do the same again
6379084 do nosso ponto de vista as informa es que est o a chegar aos ministros da opep s o tais que apenas uma recupera o dos pre os para valores bastante superiores aos 120 d lares por barril poder o impedir a retirada de uma parte substancial da produ o de crude do mercado

6379087 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 dollars an ounce
6379088 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6379089 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations
6379090 so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6379091 so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst one that was based on metals that are readily available and inexpensive but still highly active and stable so that sets us apart from most of the other groups in the world
6379092 at wmg we are developing plans for a major technology demonstrator project that will bring together global automotive leaders with research scientists and parts suppliers to look at every aspect of low carbon automotive design
6379093 this project will become more important as demand for energy becomes one of the defining features of our global environment
6379094 many of these social conflicts are ripples caused by the need for economies to secure their energy future
6379095 so if we can find ways of managing demand more effectively the long term consequences will not just be less polluting cars or more efficient factories but a less dangerous world
6379096 the more scientific solutions we apply the less pressure on resources there will be and the lower the risk of human conflict
6379097 the fundamental challenge for hospital managers is to maximise the effective utilisation of costly healthcare equipment and optimise the throughput of patients
6379098 consider the problem of ensuring patients are in the right place in hospital for their treatment at the right time a logistical issue that currently consumes the time of nurses doctors and hospital porters
6379099 we are researching systems where patients manage their own movement around a hospital with robotic guidance this frees up human resources to focus on treatment and care
6379100 in one application we found that a typical blood test sample was looked at by 21 different people each time introducing a risk of error and time and cost spent
6379101 applying these principles meant we were able to provide exactly the right number of doctors and nurses to meet patient demand
6379102 india can be a test bed for some of the things we are doing
6379103 we know we will need more energy to ensure economies grow we also know the energy we produce has an unacceptable impact
6379104 that tension creates a double role for scientists first we need to develop ways of maximising energy efficiency second we need to find new sources of energy
6379105 these have been brought together in a racing car platform
6379106 this year we will be racing a formula 3 car built from natural origin materials and running on biofuels
6379107 in terms of preventing the spread of infection the most important and effective method is hand washing whatever the organism people should be washing their hands after touching each patient the problem is that some hospitals do not have adequate facilities for handwashing which is one of the issues highlighted in the report into vale of leven
6379108 staff have been told that they could use alcohol gel instead of washing their hands
6379109 that is not a good message to give people they should be told they should wash their hands but a lot of wards have dispensers when they should have more hand basins
6379110 what would make sense would be for hospitals to remove the dispensers and replace them with adequate hand washing facilities in wards and clinical areas
6379111 by and large no i suspect its because staff have been told that they can use alcohol gel rather than washing their hands and they have come to the conclusion that they are being told that because it is effective
6379112 very effective at disinfecting hands and killing a whole host of bugs and germs
6379113 hand gel provides healthcare workers with a quick method of decontaminating their hands between healthcare interventions and facilitates higher levels of compliance with hand hygiene
6379114 it is important that staff patients and visitors not only wash their hands with soap and water but combine this practice with the use of alcohol based hand gels
6379115 one woman said she really wanted to set her rowing machine so she could do the same number of strokes per minute as the olympic athletes
6379116 another caller wanted to adjust his exercise bike so he was cycling at the same number of miles per hour as the olympians
6379117 and even though the track and field events hadnt yet started people were also asking about settings for their jogging machines
6379118 with rowing and cycling machines if you cant keep up youll just go slowly but with jogging machines if you set them to the pinnacle of what its capable of doing and you cant keep up it could be dangerous

6379130 the driver said ive gone over on my ankle and i asked him if he was ok and he said im fine i remember it happening but it was so insignificant then he delivered groceries up and down the driveway about six times
6379131 tesco shouldnt allow their drivers to take action against their customers its fundamentally wrong they should be able to cover it it shouldnt be down to the customer
6379132 we do not support this claim and do not think that it is appropriate for our customer to be sued
6379133 at this difficult time for retailers and family budgets its vital that the government acts to restore economic stability
6379134 sunt intarzieri temporare in procesarea proiectelor de dezvoltare a resurselor umane
6379135 am cerut directorului general al apdrp sa ia de urgenta cateva masuri de ameliorare a functionarii directiei de control antifrauda din cadrul agentiei care in opinia mea impreuna cu directia de audit ar fi trebui sa se autosesizeze si sa nu asteptam un audit al ce pentru a clarifica anumite aspecte ce trebuiau clarificate de conducere in acest sens au fost facute niste controale pe proiecte cu potential risc si au fost facute si niste schimbari in cadrul conducerii acestei directii
6379136 impresia mea dupa citirea acestei scrisori n r a ce a fost ca intre altele in aceasta directie a fost un pic de anchilozare in ultima vreme si initiative pe care ar fi trebui sa le aiba dincolo de controalele sistemice atunci cand observa situatii de risc trebuie sa le aiba cred ca acolo trebuia mai multa initiativa si i am cerut directorului sa ia masuri in acest sens
6379137 este probabil si asta o sa vedem dupa ce fac impreuna cu doamna secretar de stat cornelia mihai o analiza si o vina a unor presoane din conducere printr o insuficienta implicare si printr o cadere in rutina care face sa nu mai observam anumite aspecte care pot sa gripeze sistemul sau sa creezeastfel de probleme
6379138 pe parcurs au aparut elemente pe care auditorii comisiei au considerat ca nu sunt suficient de clar precizate in proceduri
6379139 cu siguranta voi face ameliorari in managementul agentiei care tin nu numai de persoane care pot tine si de persoane si de modul de organizare a agentiei pentru a ne asigura ca astfel de situatii vor aparea cat mai rar posibil pentru ca aceasta corespondenta cu comisia astfel de misiuni de audit vor fi permanente in perioada urmatoare
6379140 intentia mea prima intentie nu a fost sa ies in presa si sa discutam aceste chestiuni ci sa iau masuri cat mai repede
6379141 noi am hotarat sa ne mobilizam si sa il trimitem inainte de vacanta de vara de la comisie tocmai pentru ca reluarea platilor in conditii de siguranta sa se faca cat mai repede nu stiu daca am gresit sau nu probabil ca am gresit si aici imi asum faptul ca probabil ar fi trebuie sa cer agentiei sa comunice beneficiarilor aceste intarzieri care ar fi putut sa apara pentru ca unii dintre ei ar putea fi afectati de aceste intarzieri dar in rest responsabilitatea mea era sa iau masuri si sa ma asigur ca platile se reiau in conditii de siguranta cat mai repede
6379142 m am concentrat din punctul de vedere al fondurilor europene pe apia pe problemele de la bruxelles pe ceea ce tine de un ministru atata timp cat in minister avem secretari de stat si directori ai unei autoritati fiecare are responsabilitati
6379143 ceea ce pot sa imi reprosez este ca nu am urmarit mai atent anumite probleme tehnice eu stiam de cand am acceptat postul de ministru ca la agricultura asa cum stau treburile acum chiar si ca min istru trebuie sa intri in detalii tehnice pe care daca nu le urmaresti pot sa apara probleme mi se poate reprosa si dintr o parte si din alta acum sau dupa ce imi termina mandatul ca mi am facut treaba mai mult sau mai putin bine pana atunci incerc sa iau masurile in timp real pentru ca situatia sa se remedieze in cel mai scurt timp si sa nu se mai repete
6379144 ok desigur si va rog sa ma scuzati sa nu considerati ca va raspund pe un ton ironic dar ceea ce mi reprosez este ca nu am incercat sa fiu mai destepti decat toti conducatorii agentiei care au fost inaintea mea pentru ca ceea ce ne a solicitat comisia in acest moment este sa reconstruim toate procedurile din momentul 0 deci poate ca ar fi trebuit sa fiu mai destept decat toti cei care au luat decizii inaintea mea sa pun la indoiala toate deciziile luate anterior sa nu am incredere in sistem pot sa imi reprosez ca am avut acesta incredere in sistem

6379148 a fairly obvious take on proceedings in parliament from our sketch writer
6379149 non in discussione la leadership il segretario veltroni stato scelto con la validazione pi ampia ed efficace possibile detto questo io sono convinto che un congresso avremmo dovuto organizzarlo subito dopo il voto per poterlo chiudere entro lanno e affrontare le prossime scadenze elettorali avendo risolto il problema
6379150 un partito di massa ha bisogno di una struttura flessibile ma ben definita e radicata nel territorio un partito deve avere una presenza in tutti i luoghi quando si esamina il fenomeno lega e si resta sorpresi dai suoi risultati in certe zone si trascura il fatto che in quelle zone la lega capillare e strutturata
6379151 appunto il pd non pu pensare di essere un partito di massa senza un punto di partenza che sia il partito di modello novecentesco quello il punto pi antico ma indispensabile poi ci sono altri livelli pi flessibili dove dibattere internet la tv la stampa io vado in sezione e discuto con gli altri poi i militanti si confrontano con chi la pensa come loro o anche no attraverso gli altri strumenti ciascuno dei quali non risolutivo in s vanno usati insieme
6379152 vero ma una struttura la si costruisce solo con un congresso perch in quella occasione che si contano gli iscritti si definisce un programma fondamentale la magna charta che poi la ragion dessere per la quale si sta insieme il congresso poi stabilisce cosa fare in coerenza col programma e a quel punto possono nascere opzioni diverse perch condividiamo gli stessi valori ma pensiamo a un modo diverso per attuarli le mozioni danno origine alle correnti in un percorso trasparente e limpido
6379153 oggi soffriamo perch siamo nati di corsa non abbiamo una struttura definita o labbiamo solo vagamente annunciata e allora ci portiamo dietro le correnti dei popolari neanche della margherita dei popolari o dei ds che si sono tra loro affiancate e sovrapposte
6379154 la fusione fredda andava fatta adesso non ci si pu fermare ecco tutto e allora le mozioni per un congresso sarebbero servite a rimescolare le carte oltre le posizioni date di partenza la conferenza programmatica a cui andiamo incontro importante ma non risolutiva per questi problemi

6379158 in altri termini sulla nostra mappa sessuale che si crea a partire dalle esperienze infantili e si basa sul modo in cui percepiamo lidentit e laltro e sul vissuto di eventi significativi arrivando a costruire il percorso sul quale si muove il nostro immaginario erotico
6379159 pensiamo a un matrimonio non consumato un evento pi frequente di quanto si pensi
6379160 fondamentale chiedere alluomo in un colloquio singolo se ha fantasie di penetrazione se questo tipo di fantasie non ci sono questo e non la mancanza di rapporto a diventare il problema centrale di cui importante indagare la motivazione come avvenuto in una coppia di pazienti sposati da 15 anni ma entrambi vergini lei sognava un marito dominatore mentre lui schiacciato da una madre autoritaria e invadente riuscito solo dopo una lunga terapia ad ammettere che avrebbe desiderato una donna in grado di dominarlo e dargli ordini

6379163 se il prezzo del petrolio scende sotto i 130 dollari potremmo chiudere lanno con i conti in pareggio quando il prezzo si abbasser i problemi per noi saranno praticamente finiti non registriamo nessuna crisi di domanda anzi i nostri passeggeri sono aumentati del 19 per cento rispetto al 2007 attualmente i dati finanziari negativi sono dovuti alla nostra filosofia di assorbire i costi del carburante per mantenere basse le tariffe

6379167 non casuale solo che io lavori per la quarta volta con paolo sorrentino n casuale aver accettato una parte in gomorra di matteo garrone che conosco fin da bambino queste cose nascono da una crescita comune da un atteggiamento culturale simile da una chiarezza tematica condivisa se sono in questi film perch non sono in altri dieci che non ho voluto fare non mi ritengo un attore buono per tutte le occasioni questi film sono il risultato di una scelta

6379182 the bonfire has been stacked for some time but arizona sen john mccain tossed in a match last week when he said the 86 year old law that governs use of the colorado river obviously should be renegotiated the presumptive republican presidential nominee clarified his statement wednesday saying it may have been mistakenly construed as a call to rescind the colorado compact when all he wanted was a more measured approach which nevertheless could mean less water for utah all seven compact states utah colorado wyoming new mexico arizona nevada and california signed an interim agreement in december to share the pain of colorado river water shortages and agreed to ensure that the levels of lake powell and lake mead are equal but more than 20 scientific studies conducted during the past four years show the colorado is unlikely anytime soon to be at the high level it was in 1922 when the compact was signed

6379184 freedom of speech is an american concept so i dont give it any value its not my job to give value to an american concept
6379185 if we allow things to continue unchanged and we dont take action today it would destabilize human society
6379186 developing countries will do what they can but it was clearly understood and laid down in the framework convention on climate change in 1992 that the developed countries will take the first steps frankly theyve done nothing at all and thats really tragic
6379187 we came up with the kyoto protocol in 1997 but it got ratified only in 2005 it took so long to give substance to something which had been agreed on in 1992
6379188 i hope that in the next year and a half and particularly in december 2009 when we hopefully will come up with an agreement on what to do beyond 2012 globally that we show a certain resolve and aspiration to do things that are required for the benefit of the human race
6379189 all indications are for even weaker growth than two percent in the third quarter demand and production is slowing down for various sectors
6379190 a significantly weaker growth in production for both service providers and industy this year means that the gdp growth will be much weaker than most had counted on

6379193 my son took it pretty hard no one has the right to confiscate someones property in this way its just like taking someones mail
6379194 passing this important milestone also sets the stage for a new dream we are now laying the groundwork for the future to join the elite group of software companies that have passed 2 billion in annual revenue
6379195 our second quarter results make it official salesforce com has become the first ever software as a service company to achieve an annual revenue run rate of more than 1 billion
6379196 this is an exciting milestone and fulfillment of our dream not only for salesforce com but also for the entire software industry it demonstrates that an important new model has taken hold as the future of software
6379197 passing this important milestone also sets the stage for a new dream
6379198 but now were pioneering a new frontier as well our force com platform as a service paas is an exciting new model that is energising developers and inspiring isvs to build their own applications using our services in the cloud along with our core strength in applications force com platform as a service will be the critical innovation to fuel the next level of success for our company our partners and most importantly our customers
6379199 force com platform as a service will be the critical innovation to fuel the next level of success for our company our partners and most importantly our customers
6379200 we have expanded our relationships with several of our largest and most important global customers including dell citi and canon
6379201 of note dell has signed a three year agreement through 2011 to use the force com platform to build and deploy applications to their entire global workforce this was the single largest transaction in our history and makes dell one of our most diverse customers dell will use salesforce services for sales force automation partner relationship management innovation management through their dell ideastorm com website customer support and full enterprise wide application and deployment using force com paas
6379202 i have called it kind of our trojan horse strategy where we find the way to get into the company through one of our key pieces of technology and then by building relationships with the customer over time using our direct sales force we add more products until the point where we become really the enterprise standard for that organisation
6379203 what we originally started with dell is we built the ideastorm com website for them using our ideas technology we deployed the sales force automation system for them for all of their sales force worldwide which is a substantial organisation
6379204 we also helped them enter the indirect channel through delivering the dell wall which is their partner portal based entirely on our partner relationship management technology then we saw them having interest in customer support they came to the dreamforce conference last year and got very excited about building on force com and building custom applications we also have been working with some of their key software providers to port some of the applications that they have internally natively onto force com for them to use all of that together suddenly we were one of their key technology vendors it gave them the ability to sign an enterprise licence agreement with us a three year agreement that goes through 2011 for their entire global workforce and the largest transaction that weve done
6379205 we have worked with google to integrate with search ads and apps we are currently working on deeper integration of our two cloud computing platforms starting with the announcement of the force com toolkit for googles apis as more enterprises seek to take advantage of the power of cloud computing its important for leaders like salesforce com and google to constantly collaborate on these new tools and standards
6379206 we are really about to see something unprecedented which is really the manifestation of a whole new development paradigm
6379207 we were pleased to be the exclusive crm offering at apples launch of the new iphone 3g and app store last month salesforce customers and developers were immediately able to not only run our salesforce automation application on the new iphone but also deploy custom force com applications on it as well already the salesforce com iphone edition has been downloaded more than 40 000 times in less than six weeks
6379208 we are really about to see something unprecedented which is really the manifestation of a whole new development paradigm
6379209 you see it emerging from a lot of different places
6379210 we have also seen customers want to be able to use some of the traditional internet sites like amazon and google and others to be able to deploy their applications
6379211 the customer service and support market is about the same size as the salesforce automation market we have a foothold in that market but we needed strong knowledge management systems
6379212 the customer service and support market is about the same size as the salesforce automation market
6379213 we have a foothold in that market but we needed strong knowledge management systems this provides us will high contextual and high personalised search technology this is about competing the big guys in this market the siebels and the saps
6379214 a robust knowledge based application is a top request from our customer service and support customers and were confident that this new capability will help accelerate our growth in that business and put salesforce com into larger service and support deployment
6379215 service and support remains one of our biggest opportunities and this acquisition signals our most aggressive assault to date on this 3 billion market the instranet acquisition is another major step towards our goal of creating the same level of success for customer service that we are known for in sales organisations
6379216 when we look at doing an acquisition what we look for is core intellectual property that is best of class not if its on premise or available as a service
6379217 in fact most of the acquisitions that weve done have actually been on premise software companies based on the quality of our force com platform we are able to rapidly redeploy that intellectual property into a multi tenant architecture and then deliver that as a service
6379218 we recognised that our knowledge based management was not where our customers wanted it so while they were really ready to step up for our whole applications suite that was one area that they felt that we were deficient in they asked us to partner with different companies to kind of complement what we were doing and thats really where we met instranet we were working on a large high tech transaction in our first quarter it was a big call centre opportunity and we partnered with instranet on the opportunity thats when we said this is technology that we could redevelop into the multi tenant platform on the force com and deliver that as an integrated solution to our customers
6379219 the choice of on premise knowledge management apps vendor instranet already a salesforce com partner is an intriguing one for the saas crm pure play
6379220 when we bring out the saas version we expect most customers to migrate firstly because its the most highly requested enhancement to our offering from our customers and secondly this is where the markets going but we will support instranet customers its about customer satisfaction
6379221 weve been expecting salesforce com to make an acquisition in the customer service market for some time to fill an acknowledged hole in its product portfolio
6379222 the choice of on premise knowledge management apps vendor instranet already a salesforce
6379223 salesforce com has been seriously eyeing the e service apps market for some time and cites instranets ease of deployment versus its competitors as a key differentiator as companies look to make their call centre operations more cost efficient the ability to arm reps with as much current and historical information about the customers they deal with has become increasingly important the goal is to enable such reps to resolve increasingly complex customer queries as simpler user questions are handled either by self service apps or automated agents
6379224 historically salesforce com has not had an effective knowledge base solution giving rightnow a major advantage in business to consumer b2c sales cycles which emphasize self service
6379225 over time this acquisition could improve salesforce coms competitiveness in this area
6379226 there are two important caveats first the fact that salesforce com felt compelled to make this acquisition is itself a positive indicator of the strength of rightnows position in our opinion second acquisitions do not always work rightnows knowledge base is a proven scalable solution that is deeply embedded into its offerings salesforce com will need to do a lot of integration work to compete
6379227 i am delighted that this is our best ever year but we will of course continue to work hard to improve performance further still
6379228 simran woke my wife and then told her not to stand up through the smoke and to crawl
6379229 they came into the room and we tried to call 999 but i couldnt get reception i told my wife not to panic because the next door neighbour called the fire service
6379230 my wife used to moan that simran was always in front of the tv but it was because of the tv that she saved our lives
6379231 the kids programmes are quite good for learning and simran has observed it and used the knowledge at the right time
6379232 simran reminded us to sit down and that really helped
6379233 i was in the shower when the hot water suddenly vanished and i was suddenly hit by freezing cold water it was a shock wake up call
6379234 the problem stemmed from a fault in the overhead network in pendeford
6379235 as far as i am concerned we should have nine points from our opening three games that would have put us second which would have been a great position to be at this point
6379236 the players are disappointed not glad to be unbeaten which shows the attitude we have at workington it was not so much the late goal that did us but the first if we had gone in at half time 2 0 up there is no doubt in my mind we would have won
6379237 i couldnt really fault the players because they gave me 100 per cent and i cannot ask for anymore than that if we can just tighten up at the back then we will be a force this season i am sure of it
6379238 this is something that the club and myself are very keen on it is always a good day out and a great time plus a lot of business is done on the golf course
6379239 we also wish to encourage more use by school groups who can link activities on the canal to the curriculum

6379258 if you grow breed shoot or steal anything that may look at home on our menu then bring it in and lets do a deal
6379259 weve been doing it for almost two years now but the success of it has only just recently started to boom with the credit crunch setting in
6379260 its also great for us because we get produce at a good price although we have high standards so the food we get in has to meet those we find the home grown stuff is often much better than what we can get from the suppliers
6379261 someone will say that rabbit tasted great and we say here meet the person who shot it
6379262 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
6379263 a small scale environmentally friendly settlement designed for sustainable living

6379265 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
6379266 the new words we added to this 11th edition of the chambers dictionary paint a vivid picture of current interests and concerns
6379267 had been in failing health in recent years and died of natural causes
6379268 i would like to get to know someone that is approximately my height it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
6379269 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message as we strive to further improve our green credentials
6379270 one can assume that the front six tentacles have the function of arms and that the back two take over the function of legs
6379271 people have always assumed that octopuses coordinate their gripping behaviour through visual data that seems to be true when one eye is weak another side of arms is favoured
6379272 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
6379273 kaily i want you to know i admire you so much youll be great i want you to know that
6379274 if you went to unr you would be my party buddy i would tell guys this girl i would hook you up with so many guys
6379275 youre going to seattle you dont need that stress now im sure youll meet someone so great i really do
6379276 yes i have a bit of an injury in the back
6379277 i urge those who support ib to search their hearts and consciences concerning this issue and that it be eliminated from our schools
6379278 knowing how strong willed the fan base is im sure that every fan would love to show their support to nick by donating to the ada
6379279 i have accommodations made through john mcmahon change for the children foundation to make sure that the boys will receive the book
6379280 it was a good opportunity for us to do this
6379281 we are looking forward to serving our community in any way that we can
6379282 there would be no delay and be one cohesive response
6379283 this is the first of mr campbells money to go to barrett
6379284 there have been questions as to why the borough spent over 300 000 for a new salt dome in the park area
6379285 was hier aber betrieben wird ist illusorisch die bes ufnisse finden sowieso statt ob kollektiv oder nicht
6379286 warum bieten die st dte nicht ein gratiskonzert an und sind mit der drogenpr vention und der jugendarbeit vor ort warum nicht gemeinsam ein abfallkonzept erstellen und f r sanit re anlagen sorgen
6379287 you could always sense on faces at this time of year who was anxious about going back or starting school
6379288 this is the first time were looking at the k 12 response
6379289 as educators we are aware of the impact bullying has on children
6379290 our primary goal is to make sure the school environment is healthy and conducive to learning for all children
6379291 to get at things that affect kids over a lifetime such as persistent name calling
6379292 that will leave some kid excluded and some kid the target i would argue that nobody has to go through that
6379293 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6379294 the organizations will be able to court volunteers by presenting their needs then the volunteers decide
6379295 the daytime volunteer is still there but the numbers are not what they used to be
6379296 when people listen to what these organizations have to say they may be able to see some potential in themselves that they never thought about before
6379297 they are looking for things to do and have specific talents now that they have more time on their hands they want to share those talents
6379298 even if its just sending a greeting card it can be especially helpful for those residents who have little or no family
6379299 we always have more students than we can handle she said
6379300 but the more hands to help the easier the job is for everyone
6379301 i think its a great new way to get the word out about our mission to save injured native pennsylvania wildlife
6379302 subject to the parties agreeing on final terms which release and discharge any and all claims against the borough of pleasant hills and associated parties
6379303 the fact that council voted on it could spur things on
6379304 until someone makes you aware of what to look for you dont know the signs
6379305 theyve had to deal with things in their lives that i will never see theyve had murders and drug addictions and all of this loss but they are so resilient
6379306 we have to partner with other organizations because the federal money just doesnt go very far
6379307 shelters didnt want to bother with all of the red tape to get them enrolled school districts didnt want to deal with them and parents had so many problems they didnt want to deal with it
6379308 we make sure they have backpacks uniforms and school supplies
6379309 there have been several fires in the district and we know about them but we dont always know about a family losing a job unless someone tells us there are also kids who move out of their homes and live with friends because of problems within the family such as divorce drinking or drugs they try to escape these situations
6379310 if we find out the student is homeless we provide whatever services they need and we hook up many times with gail odorcich
6379311 sometimes she tries to tell me what to wear i try it on and if it looks nice i will buy it
6379312 they will last a long time she wont wear them every day so she wont get another pair for a while ms chettle said ms chettle operates the help desk and phone system in the information systems department of u s district court downtown
6379313 she will have to save her own money for those
6379314 i want to clarify to the residents that the borough is not responsible in any way shape or form for the poor patchwork on our roads
6379315 i keep getting calls about this and there is nothing i can do
6379316 i dont believe there is a community out there in the nation that isnt being affected by high fuel prices
6379317 a fare to remember 40 years of time tested recipes for every occasion
6379318 im just not pleased with the way the whole process came down
6379319 if i was a member of the public i would be watching these board members
6379320 based on the various existing reports studies and plans that have been produced over the past 50 years the nation should now have a
6379321 time is running out and further delays in the purposeful resolution of the crises as presently exist in the niger delta region will certainly not augur well for the nation
6379322 the long term and permanent restoration of justice through the legislative process
6379323 this is realizable through the construction of first class east west roads throughout the niger delta integrated road and railways linking the seaports to the airports massive investments in education telecommunications and health care delivery for the people of niger delta
6379324 to facilitate the rapid even and sustainable development of the niger delta into a region that is economically prosperous socially stable ecologically regenerative and politically peaceful
6379325 why have we simply refused to be even handed in our dealings with the niger delta why is my home state of bayelsa allowed only eight councils when the constitution clearly prescribes a minimum of ten councils per state why should we go to the federal allocation table with only eight baskets when we practically carry the nation on our shoulders and less endowed states are going to the same table with more than three times the number of our baskets
6379326 they might be foreign but its important to bring in players who know the premier league
6379327 we didnt use the loan deal too much last year but this time we have been looking at that
6379328 and i can tell supporters that the rest of the season will be as exciting as this game because of the way we play this is our style we did it last year and we will do it again this year
6379329 but we didnt need this win to bring us belief we can compete at this level
6379330 paul jewell did make a bit of a joke about it saying i had only been at derby county for a month and already he had turned me into an international player
6379331 it has been a bit of a whirlwind moving to a new club and then getting the call up
6379332 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6379333 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point

6379341 it is undoubtedly true that the negotiators have taken this very very far toward an end agreement but there is no reason to believe that there is an agreement yet or that there is going to be today
6379342 but i will have a chance with the prime minister to really know if there are any other gaps that we have to close from washington
6379343 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6379344 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward

6379406 it still confuses me when i think about it but it brings back a lot of memories
6379407 i hate to say it but this happens more times than it should
6379408 maybe somebodys moved or there is some disagreement over who had custody sometimes its the final reality or complacency out of sight out of mind or not knowing what to do

6379417 the difficulty lies not in the new ideas but in escaping from the old ones
6379418 world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak
6379419 when the facts change i change my mind what do you do sir
6379420 nooit eerder in mijn leven heb ik me zo gezond gevoeld
6379421 om weer in vorm te raken sta ik op een streng dieet suiker is uit den boze ik eet geen fruit en drink zelfs geen vruchtensap meer omdat ook daar suiker in zit ik eet kip zalm en rijst avocados ook als ontbijt eet ik het wit van ei en soms een kalkoenburger als middagmaal ik probeer me aan een maximum van 1 200 calorie n per dag te houden dat lijkt weinig maar als je de juiste zaken eet is dat best een hoop voedsel
6379422 het sap van pompelmoezen sinaasappelen en appelen ervoor zorgt dat geneesmiddelen veel minder goed opgenomen worden door het menselijk lichaam
6379423 e n keer kwam ik een leeuw tegen hij deed me wel snel fietsen
6379424 dikwijls maakt de plaatselijke bevolking tussen twee dorpen wel een soort van spoor aan
6379425 olifanten banen zich ook altijd een weg dat meteen breed genoeg is om te mountainbiken alleen kan je er onderweg dan eentje tegenkomen best gevaarlijk
6379426 het wielrennen raakt hier bijzonder moeilijk van grond met n voetbal heb je 22 spelers om te wielrennen heeft iedereen een volledige fiets nodig talent is er genoeg maar aan fietsen geraken en ze kunnen onderhouden dat is wat anders
6379427 binnen 48 uur zijn nu al drie schepen gekaapt het begint een bijzonder gevaarlijke situatie te worden
6379428 why do i have to do this if youre not going
6379429 en el congreso de 2006 dijimos que lo bamos a revisar pero la situaci n del principio de este torneo no se puede repetir el comit ejecutivo podr tomar medidas para proteger el torneo de londres 2012 que ya figurar en el calendario de fifa
6379430 queda un problema pendiente para resolver despu s del torneo ol mpico
6379431 les doy las gracias a todos porque pese al laudo no hicieron nada para recuperar a sus jugadores en el caso de messi hubo un acuerdo de caballeros entre joan laporta y julio grondona presidente de afa y por tanto la decisi n del laudo no afect me quito el sombrero ante el barcelona messi est aqu y es uno de los atractivos de los partidos
6379432 la cifra r cord de un 1 900 000 espectadores a falta de tres partidos y se espera llegar a los dos millones
6379433 el nivel del arbitraje en el torneo femenino ha mejorado much simo los rbitros del masculino est n todos en la lista de fifa para el mundial 2010 no tengo m s que halagos para ellos no es f cil ser rbitro en estos d as cuando hay veinte c maras de televisi n que repiten hay que entender que son humanos
6379434 el objetivo es cerciorarnos de que el comit organizador local tenga el respaldo para la organizaci n del gobierno entrante ya que se celebran elecciones presidenciales en abril y del saliente tenemos que confiar en sud frica d ganme un pa s del mundo que tenga garantizada la seguridad al cien por cien
6379435 par par los defensores cuando mierda se van a enojar con los volantes perdimos cinco pelotas seguidas no podemos errar un pase a diez metros son jugadores de primera loco

6379439 vitamina tiene bien claro lo que piensa y vamos a morir con la nuestra
6379440 tuvimos un golpe duro y cuando uno mastica bronca esta bronca se tiene que transformar en hambre y eso es lo que tenemos ahora los jugadores de central
6379441 ante un resultado negativo es f cil criticar lo digo por el ejemplo mio de tobillo si le hubi ramos ganado a river vitamina ser a un fen meno porque me puso a pesar de la molestia como perdimos y jugu mal dicen que se equivoc y que yo no tendr a que haber estado
6379442 curiosamente santa fe es una de las mejores productoras de perros con alta capacidad corredora producto de la excelente selecci n de los padres que realizan los criaderos particulares y los due os de perros galgos oriundos de la provincia deben recorrer largas distancias para ver correr a sus animales
6379443 nos llegan galgos destrozados sometidos a un doping terrible les inyectan hormonas para potenciar su energ a y terminan con problemas card acos y renales
6379444 despu s los abandonan tras una actividad de lucro contra el perro
6379445 se sobreentrena a los animales para lucrar con ellos vamos a impedir que prospere el proyecto que pone al perro como un valor utilitario
6379446 conociendo el fanatismo que impera van a usar a los perros para la timba
6379447 preocuparse por otros temas como la educaci n de los ni os
6379448 legalizar las carreras es lucrar con los perros cuando en realidad se debe educar a la gente para que quiera a los animales protegerlos y no usarlos como un juego
6379449 ya cuenta con muchos adeptos y resulta positivo estimularla y darle el marco de legalidad porque existen muchos interesados en proponer lugares para hacer pistas
6379450 no debe haber perros con el nivel de atenci n que tienen los galgos
6379451 apostamos a una fuerza comunitaria con un trato fluido con la gente y capaz de atender cada reclamo que se nos plantee
6379452 en juan hek hemos encontrado una persona muy predispuesta tanto en la polic a de rafaela como en el departamento la capital lo mismo que el comisario g mez quien viene de desarrollar una interesante labor en el departamento san mart n
6379453 estamos convencidos de que hay muchos polic as como ustedes les dijo el mandatario a los nuevos jefes y esta es la gran fuerza que tiene la polic a de santa fe nosotros estamos comprando m viles camionetas motos y si bien todo eso es importante si no est la sustancia que son los hombres que est n al frente de la instituci n por m s veh culos que se compren las cosas no van a funcionar
6379454 hace poco m s de seis meses al asumir en la ur i dije que no era un hecho com n que un gobernador ponga en funciones a un jefe de unidad regional hoy creo que la polic a de santa fe tiene un antecedente hist rico como instituci n que el se or gobernador ponga a cargo a un jefe de polic a de la provincia nos da un mensaje muy claro a los casi 17 mil efectivos que componemos la fuerza y denota la importancia que nuestros conductores pol ticos le dan a la instituci n policial
6379455 tener reglas ajust ndonos a derecho trabajando como auxiliares de la justicia y fundamentalmente a darle a la poblaci n la respuesta que espera de nosotros
6379456 kenny your hair is getting less and less whats going on youre only 26
6379457 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
6379458 we did not win 2004 elections massively because we were so complacent i am saying today that we need to be very meticulous because this race is very competitive we have our achievements to tell the people and we must tell our success story
6379459 but today we are in government and have achieved a lot
6379460 women have an exceptional ability to organize and persuade people to change their minds in fact you play an important role in party politics

6379462 anytime you express your candid opinion depending on what you say you are either tagged as new patriotic party npp or national democratic congress ndc activist this is dissuading meaningful non political persons to genuinely contribute to national debate and offer alternative ideas
6379463 if just the registration of the electorate degenerates into violence breach of the political parties election 2008 code of conduct and other infractions then god save ghana we cannot anticipate what will happen on election day
6379464 the christian community is not happy about this mayhem intimidation antagonism and political animosity among the political parties we are advising our members to shun politicians who engage in personality attacks and other undemocratic tendencies ghanaians need peace and stability to develop

6379467 every effort should be made by government and the people of ghana to ensure a free fair and transparent elections devoid of rancour and bitterness on the part of the participating political parties
6379468 in the same vein conference appeals to government to assist reduce the incidence of youth unemployment in the country by providing avenues for training for the youth in the trades to support and compliment formal academic education offered

6379471 much writing on music spurns the listeners half of the equation
6379472 it succumbs to musicological mumbo jumbo or mere dirt and dreams biography or to that obsessive compulsive disorder of music writing infatuated with discography and recording session lineups it leaves no room for the listener
6379473 all grammy jennings ever wanted to do was to fuck and drink

6379486 rbi had become like a cookie jar where the government as and when they wanted could just dip into the cookie jar and take what they wanted
6379487 but in 1993 there was a contract signed between rbi and the ministry of finance which paved the way for the elimination of this automatic monetization over a four year period we eliminated the automatic monetization of the deficit
6379488 what happened was gradually monetary policy disentangled itself from the fiscal policy and came in to its own
6379489 i think independence is something that is never something that is given independence is something you have to achieve you have to snatch it if it is not coming and once you get that i think you have to meticulously maintain that

6379491 provo gioia per essere al traguardo ma anche amarezza per ci che la citt sportiva ha dovuto conoscere nei mesi scorsi di positivo c il fatto che la politica ha fatto il suo dovere con grande coesione adesso la squadra ha una propriet seria e con intenzioni ottime

6379513 the name is generally attributed to the fact that the region in which the meteorological conditions in question were originally noticed was still occupied by the indians
6379514 se valutiamo i trend possiamo notare che il nostro in continua ascesa mentre la toyota ha avuto alcuni alti ed alcuni bassi questo mi fa supporre che noi abbiamo basi pi solide e possiamo proseguire nella nostra rimonta con successo
6379515 la bmw appare in calo costante noi invece negli ultimi due appuntamenti abbiamo dato il meglio della stagione ed abbiamo raccolto pi punti di loro non credo che siamo superiori ma penso che continuando di questo passo potremmo raggiungerli entro la fine della stagione
6379516 ci stiamo muovendo nella giusta direzione e questo mi rende fiducioso che si possa chiudere la stagione al quarto posto nel mondiale e con la terza macchina pi veloce in pista

6379524 this years gcse results are the best the school has achieved
6379525 we look forward to welcoming a large number of this year group into our sixth form to continue their education at newman and we are immensely proud of our students achievements
6379526 this is a stunning performance in science for the school we are now looking forward to record numbers of students going on to study it at a level
6379527 a combination of able and motivated students and high quality teaching supported by the very best of modern laboratory facilities has produced such outstanding results
6379528 we are delighted with our provisional figures which show a five a c figure of 52 per cent the figure is 26 per cent for those who have five a c including english and maths they are the best the school has ever achieved
6379529 students have worked hard staff have worked hard and everyone has been well rewarded by this success im particularly pleased that students have achieved so well despite the changes the school has been going through this year
6379530 it shows a real determination on the part of students and true professionalism on the part of staff im proud to have been headteacher here to have worked with staff students and parents to bring about this success
6379531 i do not love people because they are beautiful but they seem beautiful to me because i love them

6379533 wanted to go beyond iraq in dealing with wmd proliferation mentioning in particular saudi arabia iran north korea and pakistan
6379534 no longer a bulwark against falling dominoes in afghanistan pakistan hopes to portray itself as a moderate islamic state that can buffer extremist iran chaotic afghanistan and an uncertain central asia
6379535 pakistans decade long reputation as the epicenter for three major internal security upheavals in indias state of jammu and kashmir afghanistan and tajikistan all these conflicts involve fundamentalist devout who have been clandestinely trained and supported by pakistans religious parties or its military
6379536 partially because he doesnt have the capacity to break it down since he and many of his military colleagues created this fire
6379537 besides their obvious repercussions in central asia and afghanistan these struggles could have potentially spill over effects on india with the worlds second largest muslim population and china with its restive turkik muslim minorities
6379538 pakistan is next on the list given close historical links between elements in its security services and al qaeda
6379539 aimed at protecting the united states from wmd attacks would identify pakistan and north korea as the leading perils and put iraq in a rather distant third place
6379540 with anti americanism intensifying throughout the region it is not hard to imagine these officers providing the militants with some of pakistans wmd weapons and technology on the other hand the current leadership in iraq has no such ties with islamic extremists on the contrary saddam has been a life long enemy of the militant islamists and they view him in an equally hostile manner
6379541 countries who pose a greater threat to american interests than iraq yet whom were happy to cozy up to
6379542 poses more threat to the united states than does the situation in iraq
6379543 the best person to work with we ought to be helping him to have better control over his country the united states and india would suffer greatly if pakistan fails
6379544 an uncritical acceptance of the koran as the final manifesto of god
6379545 promising aspirations but there are also troubling aspects of this crucial document
6379546 the time is right for the international community to weigh in this constitution must provide an enduring promise to all the afghan people that their most basic freedoms are inalienable not to be granted or withdrawn easily by a government its courts or its religious leaders
6379547 regime in kabul and the integrity of pakistan could be threatened
6379548 clearing pakistani territory of foreign militants who are pursuing a global jihad
6379549 even those pakistanis who until recently sympathized with the struggles of fellow muslims under oppression for example those of the kashmiris palestinians and chechens are beginning to recognize that the methods of the jihadis are a threat to global order
6379550 do not want their country to be subjected to an international military operation like the ones in afghanistan and iraq
6379551 im determined to punish this tribe and make them an example
6379552 it is another excellent set of gcse results and i am very pleased with them i would like to congratulate all the pupils on their hard work and would like to thank the dedication of the staff and the support from parents
6379553 record numbers of students will attend sixth form and i look forward to celebrating future successes with them

6379555 we were delighted last week with our a levels results last week and now we are equally delighted with our gcses
6379556 sixty five per cent of the year group achieved five a c passes 51 per cent achieving five a cs which included english and maths
6379557 they exceeded the target which was agreed with the local authority by seven per cent and that is a great achievement
6379558 this result is one to be proud it is the culmination of five years hard work and i would publicly like to thank of the parents for their encouragement and support the school staff for their tremendous work and most importantly of all the pupils
6379559 i am unable to express myself and have problems with speech and understanding
6379560 sesungguhnya allah tidak melihat rupa dan harta hata kamu tapi melihat hati dan perbuatanmu
6379561 we believe state and federal governments have a responsibility to help out these people and providing funding that allows for transition into other jobs
6379562 the government must do everything it can to assist these people

6379567 they have dangled the carrot in front of him and now taken it away its very hard to stay upbeat and positive to get through this illness without the added pressure of possible financial problems but we will not give up without a fight
6379568 what is the point of all this wonderful research which is mainly financed by devoted fundraisers in the uk if the life saving medication that is discovered is beyond the ordinary working persons resources
6379569 no matter what we have to do he has to have that treatment we have discussed financially what we would have to do i would urge people to write to jamie reed to get him to fight for local people to have the right to these drugs
6379570 nice and the local nhs cancer network does not recommend the use of avastin for certain types of cancer
6379571 its believed the shots came from the south side of the church they were firing across the road
6379572 there was also a car that had a couple of bullet holes in it that doesnt belong here in this neighborhood
6379573 you ought to be thoroughly ashamed of what was thoroughly reprehensible conduct on your parts
6379574 the sra closed down her firm on august 19 because we have extremely serious concerns about financial irregularities
6379575 that is as much as we can say at this stage but things will become clearer later
6379576 there is nothing proven yet but we are allowed to intervene on the grounds of suspicion only
6379577 we have appointed another firm in durham to look after the interests of her clients clients should not panic
6379578 if money has gone astray it will either be dealt with by the solicitors indemnity insurance or if that doesnt work there is the sra compensation fund im confident that clients will not lose money as a result of this intervention
6379579 thats one of the guarantees that you get by going to a regulated solicitor
6379580 we have large crowds during peak season which falls between june and august
6379581 this period is holiday season so people travel a lot while students resuming school in the uk in september also apply for visa during this period
6379582 if you come as early as 5 a m to queue you will definitely not make the first 100 on the list
6379583 there is no adequate shelter its just so crazy you can imagine the weather condition now
6379584 whilst we did see an initial increase in the number of applications being submitted at the abuja centre following the closure of the port harcourt centre our office in lagos witnessed a similar increase in the number of applications it received
6379585 i would in fact suggest that people are submitting their applications at the ikeja or ibadan centres in the event of them not being able to access the victoria island centre
6379586 we work very closely with our commercial partner in nigeria and have no reports of the bio metric equipment breaking down
6379587 if an applicant is denied a uk visa having obtained an unconditional acceptance letter from a uk institution and having paid a deposit on production of the visa refusal notice the institution will refund the deposit in full excluding administration charge

6379597 i was in hong kong for jungle survival training when we got the call i was still 17 we thought or hoped by the time the ship got there it would all be over it lasted two months
6379598 there was a field hospital there it was obliterated just three hours after we left the area
6379599 at two sisters we got shelled constantly for two days some of them were very close ripping your tent sheets down
6379600 when they train you they put you on such a high make you think you can walk on water its not until you see the first casualties the limbs that you realise you are not bullet proof
6379601 the adrenaline buzz you got when the planes came in was like suddenly being told youd won the lottery it would be worse to have joined up and not seen any action im glad maggie thatcher made us go but it would make me really upset if they were to give up the falklands now
6379602 someone went over recently and said theyve not been touched it was like the war just ended a fortnight ago

6379606 the police investigation at this stage is focusing on the coach itself rather than the road where the crash happened
6379607 examination of the coach is ongoing and officers are beginning to interview the coachs passengers

6379628 its a massive challenge we havent beaten them for a fair while
6379629 were going to try and pick a team that is confident and is young and that can run and give us a chance to win
6379630 we are bringing a couple of young blokes back to give them a really good experience against a really good team
6379631 collingwood have got a few young guys in as well so i think it will be a snapshot of the future
6379632 it will probably give you a bit of a feel for both teams and their younger players and how both teams are going to look three or four years from now
6379633 the way the game has opened up a bit with the rules and things like that i think every team is probably having a lot more trouble this year defending than in previous seasons
6379634 but certainly leo brings a lot of confidence back he is a very good player
6379635 it would be silly to do the same thing over and over again and get the same result we have to do things differently which we will
6379636 this is a lot different market to melbourne weve got pressure on us to be competitive every single year and we understand that
6379637 we will make some changes at the end of the season but they wont be as dramatic as what probably people think they should be
6379638 es gibt kein vertun wir haben zur zeit die seuche

6379640 the calf was in much worse condition than they originally thought and the injuries were a lot worse than they thought as well probably from a shark attack
6379641 we have taken the hard decision to put it down unfortunately

6379647 facilitated interviews by or on behalf of the united states incommunicado and without access to a lawyer in pakistan
6379648 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004
6379649 it is a long standing principle of the common law that confessions obtained under torture or cruel inhuman or degrading treatment cannot be used in evidence in trial
6379650 by seeking to interview bm in the circumstances found in pakistan and supplying information and questions for his interviews the relationship between the united kingdom government and the united states authorities was far beyond that of bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing

6379657 much of the drive behind this increase is coming from growing consumer awareness and falling hardware prices coupled with ps3 owners increasingly using their consoles for video playback
6379658 i would be amazed if we dont see a blu ray player in the u s at or below 250 by the end of this year and in order to stimulate consumer traffic in the holiday season whos to say there wont be a product at closer to 200

6379660 hoewel het in essentie om voorgedragen gedichten gaat levert de podiumervaring van de twee dichters en de felle gitaarlicks de stompende trombone en elementaire ritmes soms ska soms kift achtige hoempapunk een prachtig resultaat op podiumpo zie maar dan net een stapje verder
6379661 het is de caleidoscopische mix van ska punk pop jazz en po zie die goed uitpakt verrast en boeit voorbindbuik is een aangenaam fris leuk album

6379666 the first 3 skypephone was about building one of the most popular internet services skype into the heart of the device the 3 skypephone s2 builds on this approach and brings a host of other popular internet services to the front of the device using the internet on your phone has sometimes been fiddly or complicated because of the limitations of traditional interfaces with the 3 skypephone s2 weve taken our long experience of putting the web onto mobiles and have used it to create a new concept in user interfaces the switcher key gives you instant and intuitive access to all of the core services on the phones menu carousel from every screen making the mobile internet an easy to use reality
6379667 with this beautiful new addition to the 3 skypephone range of mobile devices both skype and 3s customers will continue to reap the benefits of being able to make free skype to skype calls and send free skype instant messages while on the move

6379673 we have proposed to sanzar that a bye be included when new zealand tour south africa next year
6379674 the springboks will then play the all blacks twice and the wallabies once just after the tour by the british and irish lions
6379675 when they come here the time difference favours them they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there
6379676 then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays
6379677 sanzar consists of three countries and the profits and losses should be shared
6379678 from a business point of view it was too expensive to include a bye
6379679 during the first extended tri nations series in 2006 the springboks spent an additional week in sydney but it means the tour is then extended to five weeks
6379680 some players who are involved in the super 14 competition already have a tour of five or six weeks behind them when the tri nations starts
6379681 this is our final judging until the fair opens its fine tuning
6379682 well be out at 10 tonight precision is what were looking for in adults
6379683 one of our goals now is broadening our qualified judging panel
6379684 there are off flavors in the flours for us were looking for the ideal of what its going to be

6379686 je mag jezelf pas een goede actrice noemen als je in een mooi theaterstuk hebt gespeeld een paar mooie films hebt gemaakt en een paar goede rollen hebt neergezet
6379687 ik zit nu vier jaar in het vak en het gaat steeds beter
6379688 i want to voice support for russia over the situation around abkhazia and south ossetia we understand the essence of the russian position and consider its military reaction a response to provocation by the georgian side
6379689 ik heb er een hekel aan als lingerie niet comfortabel zit pasvorm en comfort waren het uitgangspunt
6379690 my parents say i always used to say if this would happen i would do this or if this would happen i would do that just ridiculous scenarios
6379691 but i guess somewhere in the back of my mind it paid off
6379692 ive told him you can come talk to me anytime you want but i dont want him to feel unnatural
6379693 noahs always been one of the good guys one of the guys you really enjoy coaching i just wanted him to get back to the way he always was and i feel like hes gotten back to himself since he got back to training camp
6379694 they dont cut an avocado until you order it so its going to take about 15 minutes is that ok
6379695 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
6379696 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
6379697 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
6379698 i do not agree with what you have to say but ill defend to the death your right to say it
6379699 we dont want them as priests and neither does rome
6379700 our understanding is that he was released from custody when mexican courts ruled that he couldnt be extradited because the statute of limitations had run out
6379701 the warrants for beltrans prosecution here remain valid and active should he ever fall within our jurisdiction the sacramento district attorney will prosecute
6379702 we were really hoping that justice would be served and people could get their day in court
6379703 to be denied justice by mexican authorities is tough to swallow
6379704 having just sat through a deposition of a father beltran victim yesterday who was molested over 100 times i am extremely disappointed
6379705 each case is evaluated on a case by case basis and when it is done as a penalty it must be for a grave reason
6379706 its hard to fathom how hurtful this must be to his victims
6379707 by the way if you had been chained to the reactor at three mile island when it started its reactivity you would have gotten about the equivalent dose of an x ray
6379708 mantener la constancia en el juego debe ser el objetivo para ser campeones

6379711 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
6379712 well that persons eternal destiny is in gods hands so why do i need to do anything
6379713 im very aware of the effect that todays announcement will have on our customers and i recognise that this is a very tough time for everyone
6379714 this was not an easy decision to make and weve tried to keep these increases as low as possible while protecting as many of our customers as we can
6379715 soaring energy bills pose a huge threat to our standard of living gas and electricity are essential commodities which have now become a luxury that many can no longer afford
6379716 consumers are going to have to adjust quickly and there are two key steps to this making sure we pay the lowest possible price for our energy and learning to use less of it
6379717 i would also urge people to contact their suppliers to find out what help they can get towards making their home more energy efficient we are all paying an extra 39 a year on our bills towards suppliers energy efficiency schemes so why not try to get something back
6379718 look at me not the baby me me me me me im over here
6379719 todays judgment reflects the abhorrence of decent society at the methods employed by the united states government in the supposed war on terror
6379720 it has taken the courts of this country to intervene and reiterate the importance of upholding the rule of law
6379721 compelling the british government to release information that can prove mr mohameds innocence is one obvious step towards making up for the years of torture that he has suffered

6379725 no me atrevo a decir eso creo que ha sido un accidente y tendremos que ver las causas para exigir responsabilidades
6379726 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
6379727 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
6379728 certain types of video games can have beneficial effects improving gamers dexterity as well as their ability to problem solve attributes that have proven useful not only to students but to surgeons
6379729 i grew up with my dad im an only child
6379730 she called and said the balloon guy in the lawn chair just flew by the market and if you look out the door you can see him
6379731 we go outside to look and lo and behold there he is hes flying by probably 100 to 200 feet off the ground
6379732 he takes his bb gun and shoots some balloons to lower himself to the ground when he hit the ground he released all the little tiny balloons people were racing down the road with cameras they were all talking and laughing
6379733 the gospel i preached is not something that man made up i did not receive it from any man nor was i taught it rather i received it by revelation from jesus christ
6379734 this man paul is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the gentiles and their kings and before the people of israel

6379740 i was told at the time that id never shoot my bow again so to be going to the games is amazing
6379741 i have had a lot of support to get there my hope is to come home with a medal
6379742 it is the ultimate sporting achievement to represent your country at that level its an opportunity i never thought id have because of the bow categories and im looking forward to it very much
6379743 its going to be difficult because we shoot well together but were all friends if one of us knocks the other out were going to support each other and hope that one of us gets a medal
6379744 the focus is on beijing because it is so close but london is in the back of my mind because it is only four years away
6379745 the greens are worried it will drag new zealand back into an alliance structure and into the sort of wars that the americans british and australians are involved in in iraq and afghanistan
6379746 the exercise of common sense over perhaps a more ideological position earlier on that because we disagreed on the nuclear issue then we couldnt do anything together
6379747 duke nu the plebism ha well the game had better be freaken amazing with all the riceyuk the guy is a complete nutter im surprised he is still alive

6379755 there are doubts over the osces role during the initial stage of the conflict they were notified by the georgian side that there would be an invasion but did not warn russian peacekeepers
6379756 this fact makes us reconsider our relations it is an obligation of the osce to report on troop movements and they must answer for it
6379757 since the loans run for up to 12 years there is need for a limit on how long you are expected to live seventy is an adequate limit
6379758 at least 30 people have been killed and 100 more are injured
6379759 it was suicide bombings the bombers targeted the civilian factory employees as they left the factory after shift change
6379760 i think its divisive for the support hillary campaign to continue at this time she made the decision to fully support mr obama
6379761 i dont know why theyre not taking their cue from hillary and falling in line
6379762 her supporters acting on their own because theyre proud of what they have done for her
6379763 obama could not seal the deal with voters during the primaries
6379764 the more voters got to know him the more voters chose hillary clinton
6379765 democrats must offer voters the candidate with the best chance of winning in november the experienced candidate who understands the problems we face and the solutions we need senator hillary rodham clinton
6379766 where obama once got a free pass on such despicable relationships with anti american people such as rev jeremiah wright george soros louis farrakhan the american voters are beginning to realize what a questionable and shady past this man has led
6379767 we had hoped that this kind of politics especially from within the party would have been abandoned
6379768 we have a historic moment that we need to grasp and we need to move forward as a unified party
6379769 all it will do is give the republican party a greater opportunity to fight our candidate
6379770 if she doesnt stand up and speak against it then shes for it if shes aware of it she needs to make a clear statement that this should not be done
6379771 with that cadre of mal discontents who want to have a war on the democratic floor
6379772 what is my role at the convention then if not to vote for hillary
6379773 if this is just about obama then only invite the obama delegates

6379779 hypsilophodon had elongated legs and a stiffened counterbalancing tail that suggest it was almost certainly a fast runner
6379780 the plates might have functioned to support the ribcage during fast running
6379781 that as the body of the dead hypsilophodon individual rotted and collapsed the bones from the skin came to be closely associated with the internal bones
6379782 our careful reexamination of the specimens shows however that the bony plates are always closely associated with the outside surface of the ribs from the front end of the ribcage and are certainly not armor
6379783 can such a belligerent state be trusted as the guarantor of europes energy supply
6379784 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency

6379797 i think tuesday was a pretty good indication that im on form and today was too
6379798 i will be beating myself up now if i wasnt already over the last few days
6379799 i was just hoping that this was going to be another preparation for the final
6379800 im feeling complete disappointment i came here for a medal and im not even in the final
6379801 i tried to pick it up around halfway and had the start of a good finish but then i just fell apart in the last 100 metres
6379802 if we have a perfect race then you can expect great things in our field if youre less than perfect from start to finish then its all over done you might as well pack up and go home
6379803 it was his day off and the rev dean borgmeyer had plans for tuesday shopping buying supplies for incoming students at weirton madonna high school maybe even catching a movie

6379912 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6379913 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6379914 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6379915 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6379916 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6379917 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6379918 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6379919 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6379920 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6379921 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6379922 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6379923 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6379924 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6379925 it doesnt matter if you win or loose as long as we beat new zealand
6379926 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia he said
6379927 its going to have to make decisions earlier than other states in terms of what the next generation of power plants are going to be
6379928 given 90 per cent of electricity comes from fossil fuel and in the future we cant use fossil fuels at least not to the same extent the creation of this group to stimulate an objective debate about nuclear power makes a lot of sense
6379929 nuclear energy has been going for 50 years but not many people know much about it the brisbane lawyer said
6379930 the idea is to be an education forum to help educate people on the pros and cons of nuclear energy
6379931 there is no logic i can see for queensland to not develop uranium reserves he said
6379932 queenslands economy is booming its appetite for electricity is growing faster than any other state in australia he said
6379933 the vets who had a look at him were really surprised at how fast hed gone downhill npws spokesman john dengate said
6379934 hes having difficulties breathing and his flippers were at an unnatural angle
6379935 their advice to us was hes not going to last much longer hes suffering and you should take action
6379936 its a really tragic result from an operation that people worked really really hard mr dengate said
6379937 theres no way that the logistics of feeding that animal by hand or in an aquarium is going to work mr jenner said in a statement
6379938 there are too many difficulties with it and the animal first of all has to be convinced to eat out of a tube its got to get to an aquarium and then youve got to find a product for it to eat which you can supply for probably a year
6379939 so i think for humans to try and keep it alive is just going to end up as a disaster
6379940 get it into the vicinity of the other cow and calf and hopefully the cow would take on two calves which would be pretty unusual
6379941 there were four cookie cutter shark bites in it and that has most likely occurred while it was out in the open water its just another thing that compounds the whole problem mr harrison said
6379942 even if they are able to entice the calf out into open water it would face a higher predation pressure from sharks
6379943 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin mr iemma said
6379944 the key here is hes weakening hes losing the strength to get him fed and a pod that will care for him mr iemma said
6379945 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years the babies 38 year old father pabla maghar singh said
6379946 we have been waiting for this moment for 15 years the babies 38 year old father pabla maghar singh said
6379947 they seem to have decided to go really personal because they think thats worked for the tories
6379948 labour have let us down they make big promises about cutting emissions but then they back dirty coal fired power stations and plan another runway at heathrow and they build expensive new roads instead of funding proper public transport
6379949 actual greens find it pretty straightforward to go green but it certainly seems impossible for the liberals
6379950 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6379951 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6379952 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6379953 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6379954 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6379955 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6379956 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6379957 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6379958 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6379959 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6379960 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6379961 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6379962 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6379963 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6379964 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6379965 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6379966 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6379967 i want some introspection but lets be realistic im never going to be able to completely create that scenario
6379968 you break down the walls as much as you possibly can
6379969 he went into the pond hoping to be blessed when a crocodile attacked him and dragged him into the deep part of the pond kabir said
6379970 this is a very unusual incident normally the crocodiles are very friendly and do not harm people
6379971 two men apparently blew themselves up outside the factory during a shift change the bombers were on foot and they exploded themselves less than a minute apart he said
6379972 i was working in the factory when i heard one blast and then another they were huge he said
6379973 security people then immediately surrounded the place and we were not allowed to go outside they allowed us out one by one after clearing the area
6379974 the blast took place as staff were leaving after finishing their days duty and it was very crowded said zaheer shah of edhi rescue pakistans largest private charity
6379975 we have 25 ambulances working and there also army and factory staff engaged in the rescue work shah said
6379976 we are aware that several cars have been broken into in the area as well as at erie basin marina
6379977 we will not tolerate this type of quality of life crime which ruins the experience of the buffalo waterfront
6379978 we are installing these cameras to ensure the safety of the visitors to the waterfront
6379979 with the newly opened greenbelt pathway and the outer harbor parkway currently under construction we are going to see an increased number of visitors along this stretch
6379980 this camera provides added protection for residents looking to take in a safe and enjoyable waterfront experience

6379989 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6379990 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6379991 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6379992 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6379993 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6379994 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6379995 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6379996 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6379997 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6379998 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6379999 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
