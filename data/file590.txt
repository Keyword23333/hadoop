5900000 so i called my mother sobbing and lost she made me promise to seek help from someone at my school after that i told my tutor and got help
5900001 the private public rhetoric on health care is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
5900002 if our governments are unable to fund the education of the number of doctors we need we must consider alternatives public private partnerships are used in such circumstances to build infrastructure including roads bridges and hospitals lets explore similar initiatives to develop new medical schools
5900003 shocking that 1 500 young highly educated canadians are currently attending medical schools outside of canada
5900004 we must not deny any patient access to essential health care based on ability to pay nor should we deny access based on a shortage of doctors hospital beds or operating time
5900005 competition consumer choice and market principles barely exist in our health system yet health care is subject to normal economic pressures and principles
5900006 as we meet at the time of the olympic games and as canada looks forward to hosting the 2010 winter games lets note that three of the six main olympic values excellence universality sustainability are similar to our values and aspirations for a truly great health system
5900007 and of course an integral part of the olympics is competition without competition we cannot expect improvement let alone excellence
5900008 i believe that if we are to preserve universal health care for the next generation we need to embrace similar principles
5900009 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
5900010 collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health for example in last octobers throne speech i listened as the topic of health care was almost completely ignored by our conservative government
5900011 not to be outdone the liberal party of canada recently sent out a questionnaire based on what they identified as todays issues of crucial significance
5900012 of 16 questions in their poll not one question related to health care
5900013 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventive medicine
5900014 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5900015 if youre not sure if its your bus ask the driver
5900016 sometimes they forget to change their signs and you dont want to wind up on the wrong bus
5900017 metros idea is that people will learn how to ride the bus and want to do it themselves
5900018 im practicing so that i can take care of myself and be independent
5900019 and its an adventure i havent taken a bus for 20 years
5900020 there may be some tough choices there may be some pain but what we need to do is we need to spend within our limits and not spend beyond our limits
5900021 and thats the problem we have in this state we spend too much money we need to cut spending
5900022 god dammit why couldnt she have just a little insurance
5900023 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board we were last aware that he remained in transit
5900024 its our understanding that vern buchanan was involved these are vern buchanans dealerships so none of this could have been happening without vern buchanan knowing about it
5900025 no one in the campaign advised anyone to make improper donations that is an issue between those businesses and their employees
5900026 the flora and fauna around us are shifting over time due to climate change

5900031 they came out from us that it might be made manifest that they were not for us
5900032 it is not the glorious battlements the painted windows the crouching gargoyles that support a building but the stones that lie unseen in or upon the earth it is often those who are despised and trampled on that bear up the weight of a whole nation
5900033 i will not judge a person to be spiritually dead whom i have judged formerly to have had spiritual life though i see him at present in a swoon as to all evidences of the spiritual life and the reason why i will not judge him so is this because if you judge a person dead you neglect him you leave him but if you judge him in a swoon though never so dangerous you use all means for the retrieving of his life
5900034 it is not the distance of the earth from the sun nor the suns withdrawing itself that makes a dark and gloomy day but the interposition of clouds and vaporous exhalations neither is thy soul beyond the reach of the promise nor does god withdraw himself but the vapours of thy carnal unbelieving heart do cloud thee
5900035 when someone acts weak negligent or casual in a duty performing it carelessly or lifelessly without any genuine satisfaction joy or interest he has already entered into the spirit that will lead him into trouble
5900036 i did not hear what i should have listened to
5900037 see in the meantime that your faith brings forth obedience and god in due time will cause it to bring forth peace
5900038 a minister may fill his pews his communion roll the mouths of the public but what that minister is on his knees in secret before god almighty that he is and no more
5900039 if we do not abide in prayer we will abide in temptation
5900040 god preserve my soul and keep my heart and all its ways so that i will not be entangled
5900041 to believe that he will preserve us is indeed a means of preservation god will certainly preserve us and make a way of escape for us out of the temptation should we fall we are to pray for what god has already promised our requests are to be regulated by his promises and commands faith embraces the promises and so finds relief

5900051 but he was playing solid he waited for his opportunities and when they came along he made birdies he was always in control of his game
5900052 he has never seen the course before and an even par round on a difficult course such as this is confidence inspiring
5900053 we knew the cut would be around plus four or five and that an even par round was needed today
5900054 hes a very good match play golfer hell approach the course much the same way he did today
5900055 his game is in good shape and hell be out to beat his opponent as fast as he can

5900059 it wasnt any sort of whole scale changes it was just trying to find the best way to do things
5900060 believe me theres a lot of wasted trees out there as ive always said throughout my career
5900061 for the most part its things that people dont see that we have to get on board with in a hurry
5900062 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using the term thats in place or is it coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things its a work in progress and i think that will be the case all year long
5900063 i was in the same offense for a decade for the most part
5900064 bretts been in the same offense for what 17 years almost or something when you have that comfort zone all of a sudden you have to change your thinking process you have to go ok this word means this here and ok that word means something else now its a challenge
5900065 we shrunk it the playbook a little with him in the beginning

5900074 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5900075 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5900076 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5900077 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5900078 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5900079 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5900080 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5900081 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5900082 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5900083 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5900084 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5900085 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5900086 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5900087 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops

5900104 they were launched as a romantic gesture at wedding and engagement celebrations in muddiford and braunton but could a pair of illuminated chinese style rice paper lanterns explain a wave of ufo sightings across north devon

5900107 we will hopefully be announcing our new singer soon i cant give you a name or hints yet but we have not been so happy in a long time he is a sick ass singer as well as a person we are going into audiohammer studios in sanford florida in september to record some new shit and as soon as we have it so will you
5900108 our new stuff is more brutal still fun to listen to like the first album but more of a children of bodom meets pantera s vulgar display of power wierd mix i know but we want to incorporate every band members personality into the music so were trying to find a singer that will bring his own thing and make us a band that kids want to watch live not boring like the other 98 of bands that are touring currently
5900109 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
5900110 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals
5900111 bands always say our new album is faster and heavier and then its never true so were not gonna say that but playing fast just works for us people who say we play too fast are probably right but guess what theres a million other bands that play slow people listen to dragonforce and go to the show because they know that were doing something other bands arent doing

5900117 ive started dating sharon stone and shes pretty good for 50
5900118 sharon called him and he showed the caller id to everyone
5900119 shes really into him and even asked him to come with her to mexico
5900120 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5900121 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
5900122 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
5900123 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry john stamos this ones taken

5900130 this world a world where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of port au prince see in a year where white folks greed runs a world in need apartheid on one hemisphere apathy in another hemisphere thats the world on which hope sits
5900131 who will give us the strength to give up prayerful passivism and become black christian activists soldiers for black freedom and the dignity of all humankind
5900132 became human in jesus christ so that the kingdom of god would make freedom a reality for all human beings
5900133 no person has to be a slave to anybody but must rebel against all of the principalities and powers that make human existence subhuman
5900134 the black church in america was founded on the belief that god condemned slavery and that christian freedom meant political emancipation
5900135 came into being when the black clergy realized that killing slave masters was doing the work of god
5900136 those who want to know who god is and what god is doing must know who black persons are and what they are doing
5900137 in america the holy spirit is black persons making decisions about their togetherness which means making preparation for an encounter with whites
5900138 to receive gods revelation is to become black with god by joining god in the work of liberation
5900139 god bless america no no no no god damn america
5900140 white folks greed runs a world in need apartheid on one hemisphere apathy in another hemisphere thats the world
5900141 who will give us the strength to become black christian activists soldiers of black freedom and the dignity of all humankind
5900142 to grasp for the future of god is to know that those who die for freedom have not died in vain they will see the kingdom of god
5900143 we now believe that something can be done about this world
5900144 the conduct of business by production consumption and commerce 305
5900145 only where their resistance shows christians to be a group that is incapable of being assimilated or of making the grade can they communicate their own hope to this society
5900146 provides no final revelation but calls us to a path whose goal it the word jesus shows in terms of promise
5900147 we cannot use jesus behavior in the first century as a literal guide for our actions in the twentieth century to do so destroys christian freedom the freedom to make decisions patterned on but not dictated by the example of jesus
5900148 in order that this world may remain what it is
5900149 in order that it may transform itself and become what it is promised to be

5900160 did start work at 9am and worked about an hour but then was feeling very unmotivated and feeling down for some reason about everything
5900161 cant take anything at face value always assume there are bad intentions behind everything casey ever does
5900162 i still consider waking up at 5 55am a 50 success for today since i actually got myself outta bed and if i get my 8 hours done today it will be 100 success on massive action
5900163 look i have made soom mistakes but i want to be successful so here is where im at and lets watch me get there
5900164 also i recognize some supporterz whos comments have helped me feel better this morning xxstarxx jews1did1the1housing1bubble buzzsaw99 thanks to the other supporterz mocha monica heekee etc i didnt mention by name but probably will in the future videos
5900165 you dont want to look for work aww well thats ok sweetie you can bounce on the trampoline and spend your days here indefinitely
5900166 casey did accomplish something many people in his shoes some of you haterz included would have never made it through the past year dealing with a divorce ruined credit massive debt homeless etc some of you would be hitting the pipe or drowning your sorrows some of you would be camped out on skid rowm 100 defeated some of you would have offed yourselves others would have turned to crime or even killed someone else casey did none of those things he found the strength to carry on
5900167 if you or i were a 25 year old mooching bum still living at home i dare say that our parents and most peoples parents would have booted us out of the house months ago if we acted as petulant as casey
5900168 i can relate to what youre saying i left home at 18 and struggled to make it on my own but things seem different nowadays especially here in california maybe its partly due to the cost of living out here but it doesnt seem uncommon at all for a 25 30 yr to still live at home with their parents
5900169 sharky why not support casey it seems much more productive and positive than the reason youre here
5900170 truthpolice you seem stuck on my comments regarding deadbeats did you or someone close to you go chapter 7
5900171 i agree respect is earned but its somewhat silly to say support is also earned would you turn your back on a starving infant because its done nothing to earn your support
5900172 why not support casey it seems much more productive and positive than the reason youre here
5900173 for that some like myself would never loan him a dime thats all that would concern me its up to his creditors to seek recourse im not an interested party

5900188 i talked to a clinton delegate here in maryland he told me they have been instructed to vote for hillary for president on the first ballot to make things more interesting there is a movement to swing 160 delegates from obama to clinton if that happens clinton could re establish her campaign and face john mccain in the fall
5900189 the group p u m a for public unity my a claims that 15 delegates have switched from obama to clinton in july there is still the possibility of a floor convention vote to fully seat the delegations from michigan and florida which would benefit senator clinton
5900190 the question is will it be an easy nomination for obama or one of the grandest political ambushes ever pulled off on the voting floor of the convention
5900191 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5900192 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5900193 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5900194 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5900195 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5900196 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5900197 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5900198 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5900199 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5900200 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5900201 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5900202 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5900203 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5900204 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5900205 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5900206 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5900207 for thousands of children women and elderly dead people for the inhabitants of south ossetia and of georgia falls exclusively on the current president on the parliament and on the government of georgia
5900208 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5900209 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5900210 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5900211 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5900212 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5900213 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5900214 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5900215 who are open to doing something on the production side
5900216 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5900217 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5900218 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5900219 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5900220 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5900221 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5900222 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5900223 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5900224 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5900225 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5900226 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5900227 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5900228 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5900229 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5900230 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5900231 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5900232 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5900233 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5900234 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5900235 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5900236 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5900237 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5900238 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5900239 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5900240 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5900241 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5900242 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5900243 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5900244 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5900245 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5900246 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5900247 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5900248 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5900249 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5900250 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5900251 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5900252 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5900253 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5900254 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5900255 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5900256 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5900257 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5900258 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5900259 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5900260 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5900261 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5900262 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5900263 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5900264 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5900265 the 777 300er will provide tam with the lowest fuel consumption and operating costs available for airplanes in this class
5900266 advanced avionics of the electronic flight bag will further improve tams operating economics and reduce emissions
5900267 these acquisitions reinforce our policy of operating a young fleet that provides more passenger comfort in our quest for tam service excellence
5900268 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields
5900269 and we are proud that a swiss airbus a320 will now carry its name to all of europes major airports
5900270 with its piazza grande and lake maggiore locarno offers the perfect setting for one of the worlds most important film festivals
5900271 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno
5900272 we are the national airline of the whole of switzerland
5900273 and as our countrys ambassador we are proud to represent locarno and canton ticino this wonderful region in switzerlands south
5900274 we have no right therefore to judge cities by their appearances rather than by their actual powers
5900275 most people in fact will not take trouble in finding out the truth but are much more inclined to accep the first story they hear
5900276 those who really deserve praise are the people who while human enough to enjoy power nevertheless pay more attention to justice than they are compelled to do by their situation
5900277 when people are entering upon war they do things the wrong way round
5900278 the man who can most truly be accounted brave is he who best knows the meaning of what is sweet in life and what is terrible and then goes out undeterred to meet what is to come
5900279 a man who has the knowledge but lacks the power clearly to express it is no better off than if he never had any ideas at all
5900280 for pericles had said that athens would be victorious if she bided her time and took care of her navy if she avoided trying to add to the empire during the course of the war and if she did nothing to risk the safety of the city itself
5900281 the fact is that when great prosperity comes suddenly and unexpectedly to a state it usually breeds arrogance in most cases it is safer for people to enjoy an average amount of success rather than something which is out of all proportion
5900282 in times of peace and prosperity cities and individuals alike follow higher standards because they are not forced into a situation where they to do what they do not want to do
5900283 true wisdoem is shown by those who make careful use of their advantages in the kowledge that things will change
5900284 their judgement was based more on wishful thinkign tahn on a sound calculation of probabilites for the usal thing among men is that when they want something they will without any reflection leave that to hope while they will emply the full force of reason in rejecting what they find unpalatable
5900285 we all know that what is most admired is what is fathest off and least liable to have its reputation put to the test
5900286 however on this occasion as on many others the spartans proved to be quite the most remarkable helpful enemies the athenians could have had for athens particularly as a naval power was enormously help by the very great difference in the national characters her speed as against their slowness her enterprise as against their lack of intitative
5900287 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5900288 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5900289 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5900290 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5900291 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5900292 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5900293 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5900294 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5900295 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5900296 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

5900298 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5900299 i do not support any change in the institution of marriage i do not support the creation of civil unions

5900316 this was truly a sad realization for i have longed for some time a class in which was both eager and terrified to attend plainly put being under the guidance of such experienced and knowledgeable professors is comforting knowing that there is such vast horizon of knowledge in which i can bound from extremity to extremity in pursuit of understanding is an excitement i will miss even in the short class on tuesday i left passionate and excited about being in a class whos professors could easily out parry my most sound reasoning moreover thank you for believing this class is worth while and taking the time to impart your knowledge
5900317 i once knew a good woman who was the subject of many doubts and when i got to the bottom of her doubt it was this she knew she loved christ but she was afraid he did not love her
5900318 oh i said well that is a doubt that will never trouble me never by any possibility because i am sure of this that the heart is so corrupt naturally that love to god never did get there gods putting it there so you may rest quite certain that if you love god it is a fruit not a root it is the fruit of gods love to you and did not get the by the force of any goodness in you so you may conclude with absolute certainty that god loves you if you love god

5900332 to the extent the rating agencies were actively working with issuers to help them package products in order to get a higher rating the agencies may be especially vulnerable to charges of self dealing and conflicts of interest and if the agencies did not reveal these relationships these actions might be investigated as material omissions

5900763 it was a big ask for brad to go for three golds
5900764 he was up for it but the last four days have just taken too much out of him
5900765 because bradley could hold the pace but he couldnt break off the front and generate the breaks
5900766 you need two strong guys and a lot of the guys who were here its their only race you look at llaneras gold medallist in the points and silver in the madison he wasnt half as strong as the other day
5900767 the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5900768 was killed in iraq on dec 20 2005 he came up with the idea while on a run looking at the new york city skyline
5900769 i started thinking about it looking over at ground zero
5900770 you dont know what might happen its the 110 hurdles hopefully we can win gold and silver me and david payne we have the ability
5900771 i ran 20 good hurdles i have 20 more to go to get to my ultimate goal im happy i made it to the next round

5900776 hes the one all the young girls admire him and roger federer
5900777 for them to be that young and win the gold medal thats a big thing it demonstrates how good they are
5900778 we only see the results we just see who wins gold who wins silver
5900779 its because china hasnt had a great history in track and he made history in 2004
5900780 because hes hurt we understand if youre hurt you cant do your best we were all worried about his health but we were still hopeful

5900810 in the end president pervez musharraf went if not quietly with remarkably little strife
5900811 failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the committee on the judiciary of the house and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the constitution in the house of representatives
5900812 endeavoring to cause prospective defendants to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony
5900813 the third day into the most critical investigation of the entire bush administration
5900814 maybe the most frustrated person attempting to exercise the oversight responsibilities that i have on judiciary

5900867 weve all been playing in bands for a very long time with little or no success depending on how you define that but the fact is that we went into this with only one ambition to have a good time and for us being able to still do that is really all thats important
5900868 we do like the thought of trying to be the best band in america
5900869 i mean who really knows who the best band is i dont thats for sure so for us striving to be really good at what we do and trying to have a good time thats the fun part everything else is just a little beyond us
5900870 on a good night we move more alcohol than most bands do in a week
5900871 when we first started out our audiences were maybe a little reflection of us you know people in their later 20s early 30s and predominately dudes guys who buy records and watch sports and a smattering of angry girlfriends
5900872 i think as the bands audience has grown weve actually expanded younger and there are a lot more girls coming to the shows and a lot of girls making their presence more upfront and thats just amazing
5900873 one of the coolest things i see now is fathers and sons coming to the show together
5900874 were kind of a classic rock band and people who grew up in the 70s and 80s even can probably relate to us as much as a 21 year old kid now theres also a really interesting sense of community with the fans theres a particular group called the unified scene who wear matching t shirts and form these bonds through the shows and i never thought wed see that
5900875 its really exciting to think about where this band has been and where were going
5900876 when we started we wanted to play a show and drink some beer and then last summer we opened for the rolling stones and played glastonbury and we opened for the stooges in croatia this band has really taken us around the world and its allowed all of us to see so much im pretty much amazed on a daily basis
5900877 customers are increasingly implementing hps blade system to expand their it infrastructure
5900878 with technology services and consulting and integration revenue up 13 percent year over year and outsourcing revenue up 18 percent
5900879 and we are confident in the benefits of this business combination will bring to customers partners and to shareholders we have over 500 hp and eds people dedicated full time to the integration team
5900880 poor black woman forced to strip to feed her children
5900881 found that powerful nations tend to win wars when all they seek is an opponents submission but tend to lose when victory requires an opponents cooperation
5900882 the strength of our operations and high prices bode well for a significant uplift in profitability for the 2009 financial year
5900883 this has been the most difficult and disappointing year since noni b listed on the asx in 2000
5900884 when was the last time you did the dishes jon
5900885 yes they were all very hot women babe but i chose
5900886 ed note there have been no other hot women i tend to live a rich and detailed fantasy life
5900887 you see where the joke is in that one right
5900888 didnt you like the way i worded my obsession with jennifer aniston this time around that was clever huh
5900889 jennifer will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship johns childish behaviour only confirms she was right to dump him
5900890 now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jennifer to behave like a lady
5900891 jennifer was tired of paying for everything cobwebs come flying out of johns wallet when he opens it
5900892 john liked living like a movie star when he was with her jennifer would never say anything but you could tell it irritated her
5900893 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5900894 i dont know how that can be considered alarmist when were just really trying to tell people this is florida you got a system out there youve got to respect it youve got to get ready
5900895 muxtape will be unavailable for a brief period while we sort out a problem with the riaa
5900896 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned
5900897 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5900898 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5900899 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5900900 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5900901 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5900902 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5900903 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5900904 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5900905 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5900906 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5900907 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5900908 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5900909 at this point no one is taking responsibility for which law is holding him there
5900910 now i understand that theres a florida law on fugitives that allows them to give no bond and the florida judge said he wont give bond unless the prosecutor here in arizona says its ok which is not happening
5900911 he will sit in jail until he adjudicates the charges there in miami and then well pick him up
5900912 but now its been more constructed its just going to be called j o n a s and is going to be us dealing with trying to take out the trash and not get hounded by fans its going to be a funny show
5900913 together with her husband shes raising two kids with autism and a third with add she writes about her childrens progress with love patience and strength
5900914 ywritten by a global teame of creatifs and trendsettirs assemblid in felaweshep wyth much coffee
5900915 everybody was quiet and i couldnt even see the tv anymore everyone started screaming and thats how i knew
5900916 she just said she loved us and that her dreams came true
5900917 i couldnt speak to her very long because she had three or four interviews lined up
5900918 shes been training for 10 years as a child she was into every sport in the beginning i thought she was doing it to get out of class but she kept saying mom mom i want to do this and she did it and won
5900919 i had no idea it would be on the world stage
5900920 she had a phenomenal work ethic whatever the task may be she worked like crazy
5900921 she wasnt the most gifted academically but she tried a lot and was very focused
5900922 mom and dad were always there at all the track meets
5900923 he was an amazing little twister since day one you could see he had something in him since the first day
5900924 before the olympics i asked a gymnastics federation guy about jasons chances for a medal
5900925 he said jason has the ability but the mens competition would be phenomenal he said it would be tough for jason and that he needs to stick to his routine because he has had consistency problems
5900926 in the last few months he has really pulled things together during his performance he was digging perfect holes in the middle of the trampoline
5900927 i just love that part just watching the scores pop up and see if theyre higher or lower thats one of my favourite things
5900928 thats a lot of flips and twists that skill was harder than anything else that was done
5900929 my strategys always been lets take the lead if youre good at one thing why not push the envelope a little past the other guys and make them look bad rather than a sort of conservative strategic routine and see what happens
5900930 its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5900931 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5900932 with every commitment to leave and with every failure to live up to that commitment the international pressure will grow on russia
5900933 a country relies on the word of its president being its bond
5900934 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognised borders
5900935 the russian occupation of my country is untenable it cannot be sustained
5900936 when there was a breakdown in talks in 2006 it took the momentum out of the industry
5900937 if these talks had failed for whatever reason it would have taken the momentum right out of the industry
5900938 is extremely important it reconfirms that there is an industry going forward here for the next 30 or 40 years
5900939 uh umm hmm h h h hold on a sec

5900943 what weve got is a warning a signal of some concerns
5900944 we could not dismiss the possibility that similar or related effects might occur in humans
5900945 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board we were last aware that he remained in transit
5900946 he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
5900947 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery
5900948 a lot of these technologies that will be living on the periphery like wimax are going to be pretty battery hungry
5900949 their overall story about the increasing graphics intensity running on our desktops i think thats absolutely true
5900950 the vision they have there in terms of how they think that will all converge is credible to me
5900951 very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
5900952 in established markets like europe and the united states where we have established ways of using computers im not convinced something like the mid device will really take off
5900953 as much as we get more efficient in how we use the battery were always finding more ways to leech off the battery

5900964 ese sentimiento pena ajena es el mismo que sentimos nosotros por el rid culo que est n haciendo en uruguay el alcalde leopoldo l pez y los diputados de podemos juan jos molina y hermes garc a lo que se est discutiendo en el seno de la comisi n de ciudadan a y derechos humanos es el atropello y el abuso por parte de la diputada adriana pe a quien es orquestada por sectores oposicionistas y por los medios de difusi n privados
5900965 expropiaci n obedece a necesidad de insumos para el sector construcci n
5900966 la intenci n del estado es dar una respuesta efectiva al problema de construcci n de viviendas el decreto ley aprobado por el gobierno nacional da mayores facilidades a los que desean adquirir una vivienda e introduce elementos importantes con respecto a las solicitud de cr ditos lo que va a generar una necesidad en el sector construcci n
5900967 se vino detectando que la manufactura de las cementeras era muy limitada y cubr a solo al sector privado esa situaci n y el hecho de que las empresas no hab an hecho absolutamente nada para incrementar su producci n se convirti en un problema

5900969 we will be looking to step on the gas and make a winning start
5900970 we are looking forward to this game and the other games and we are here to play really hard
5900971 i have spoken to all the players and they fully understand why we are here and what is required this is an official odi we are not taking anyone for granted we will play hard cricket whoever we meet
5900972 i am looking to do a good job for west indies cricket and see how we can continue to work as a team
5900973 communication with everyone is key at this stage and my main focus is to contribute in a big way as a leader and a player i have everyones support and it is good to be back with the players once more
5900974 it is something that cricket has to think about very carefully
5900975 this visit these few days give us the opportunity to assess the potential for cricket becoming an olympic sport
5900976 2020 must be the earliest realistic date but i must emphasise the icc has to consider its position just as the ioc has to consider its position

5900984 we had just pulled up to the dock and some kids came over and said hey weve got a fish over here with two mouths
5900985 it was really unusual the fish has an obvious abnormality i had never seen anything like that myself before i cant speculate on what might have caused it
5900986 it was important for the fish to be displayed at the conference to show people what we have been claiming all along
5900987 people were in disbelief here they saw a fish that we suspect is very much linked to tarsands development and contamination of the athabasca river our elders tell us that what happens to the animals and the fish is just a sign of what is going to happen to human life
5900988 for the most part what we have been getting is natural parasites and fin erosion which are normal in sand bed rivers
5900989 throughout the 12 years there has been no significant impact shown from oilsands development
5900990 it is very heavily represented by industry and government and we feel that it doesnt do any justice as far as accurately representing any data to the community
5900991 this is evidence and we need to ensure that is preserved
5900992 some of the community concern was that even if they were bringing them in fish for testing i dont think ramp was doing a great job in communicating back to those individuals about the testing
5900993 by invading iraq in the manner it did the us exacerbated all of the threats it faced prior to 2003 recruitment into terrorist cells shot up all over the world north korea and iran accelerated their development of nuclear weapons iran has emerged as the dominant regional power in the persian gulf once the us removed its major rival from the scene and put its shiite clients into power in baghdad while everyone is better off without saddam hussein around the cost was hugely disproportionate if you dont believe this ask yourself whether congress would ever have voted to authorise the war in 2002 if it knew there was no wmd or that there would be trillion dollar budget outlays or that there would be 30 000 dead and wounded after five years of bitter struggle
5900994 trying to rally opposition to russia on the basis of international law and norms constraining the strong from using force against the weak
5900995 mccains instinctive reliance on hard power as the primary instrument for dealing with messy questions of terrorism and proliferation in the broader middle east
5900996 we will begin to talk with communities where we think defence is not a viable option
5900997 there are significant numbers of properties under threat and where its possible to find engineering solutions
5900998 we are almost certainly not going to be able to defend absolutely every bit of coast it would simply be an impossible task both in financial terms and engineering terms
5900999 the raison detre for the asa is that companies can make the best possible claims for their product but not mislead people i absolutely dont want to discourage them from doing so the more that companies think seriously about the environmental impact of their products the better but what they mustnt do is pretend a product is greener than it is
5901000 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia

5901002 larry can you be any more of a yankee apologist just look past your yankee myopia and try some objectivity
5901003 wow larry youve produced 25 of the comments on this thread and said nothing meaningful thats impressive even for you
5901004 after reading all your postings and daily weblog i believe you have truly become the phil pepe of this generation now this is not necessarily a good thing
5901005 you blog sucks it reeds as it was written by the queer son of mike lupica and roids clemens i could write a better column by letting a monkey fuk a typewriter i dont need no 181 million dollar team to write a blog fukkk the spankeees
5901006 i think his followers have a different sexual preference than most men
5901007 im not qualified to write for online media let alone mainstream media
5901008 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
5901009 hes a smart quarterback and we believe if hes out there that he can make the right reads and do what tom does out there
5901010 youve got to react and thats part of playing the position and its part of being a good offense
5901011 i would say everything he would probably be doing hes done before it is just a question of fine tuning it working on timing and all those kinds of things
5901012 some of the practices that he hasnt participated in are still things that he has done before not new things
5901013 but to the extent if there are new things and the player misses those then we will need to catch him up on it because the rest of the team has got it
5901014 any time you can get into game situations and get out there and be in game speed its great for the development process
5901015 the more you do it obviously the more comfortable you become
5901016 hes always very supportive and points out things that he thinks that i could get better on and also points out the things that i did really well
5901017 it doesnt matter to me what people say on the outside all that matters is whats going on internally and how im doing
5901018 i feel like im making a lot of progress and i feel like i know the offense and i feel like i can go out and execute the offense

5901021 very strong growing sense that russia is not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said that it wants to be we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
5901022 the west should demonstrate to moscow its real will and ability to defend those east european countries that have already been admitted into nato and to which it is therefore legally and morally committed especially the baltic states we should say this and mean it under no circumstances should we extend such guarantees to more countries that we do not intend to defend to do so would be irresponsible unethical and above all contemptible
5901023 we have information that american military transport aviation say they are delivering a certain humanitarian cargo to tbilisi airport though they said we had bombed the airport two days ago lets ask them will they invite you the media to check whether it is humanitarian or not what is in it the cargo in reality it is of major concern to russians

5901027 we are very pleased at the calibre of candidates that act new zealand has been able to attract
5901028 i was especially delighted that our top candidates were able to make the trip to wellington to attend the special press conference and help us to release the party list
5901029 we are all now looking ahead with eager anticipation to the coming election which provides act with an opportunity to make a real difference to then nation and lives of all new zealanders
5901030 our candidates are committed act ivists all dedicated to acts plan to bake a larger economic cake and bring our children home
5901031 like act leader rodney hide i am delighted that we have attracted so many candidates of such high calibre and passion
5901032 this election is not just about giving new zealand a change of government it is about giving the country a change of direction thats exactly what our candidates are all about having the courage to make the hard decisions for new zealands future not for political gain but for the good of kiwi families
5901033 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
5901034 i ask that my privacy be respected in these difficult times and i believe that the people of the turks amp caicos islands will understand and support my wish to receive the necessary independent representation from the legal counsel of my choosing i hope that in time the turks amp caicos islands government will come to share that view although i have always been a supportive wife even in light of the very serious allegations currently pending against the premier there are limits even for me

5901105 its very rare that you get the opportunity to add a pitcher like greg even one time let alone twice
5901106 hes one of the greatest pitchers of all time and weve already seen what he can add to a team both on the field and in the clubhouse
5901107 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5901108 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
5901109 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5901110 i guess the world is divided up between redeemers and non redeemers
5901111 i happen to be a redeemer i think people can be made better and right if thats a fault so be it
5901112 my agents spoke with other teams but as far as signing there was none of them
5901113 to have that taken away from you that can be really hard
5901114 that would have been a tough thing to go through i kind of went through that i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
5901115 i think the last three or four months have been very humbling for chris
5901116 the week since the charges were dropped and his phone didnt ring i think that was also humbling
5901117 once off suspension well have an opportunity to see whether or not hed be a positive addition to the football team and go from there

5901164 as a public official youve got to accept a certain level of political involvement
5901165 i am very pleased with this game i think we played especially in the first half very well when we had the ball
5901166 you see in the second half the rhythm was a little bit broken we were not as good as in the first half but thats normal if you change two or three players and then two more
5901167 overall i can only be very pleased with the performance the mentality and attitude of the players and i can only look forward to the training camp in september in the netherlands
5901168 the only other possibility that exists is someone who went down there who didnt sign up
5901169 he just got out of surgery had his triple bypass and is resting comfortably
5901170 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
5901171 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5901172 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5901173 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5901174 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5901175 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting
5901176 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5901177 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5901178 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
5901179 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than two years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5901180 i mean the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four i dont know what their reasons are i didnt ask and i didnt care im just glad to be here and im glad they gave me a day to pitch which is friday
5901181 well put him in friday hell be pitching every five days from there
5901182 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5901183 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5901184 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned
5901185 the thing about greg he keeps everything so simple people like to make things more complicated than they need to be you learn a lot the way he approaches the game
5901186 weve had people in the ballpark his last three starts
5901187 hes pitched very well hes got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there he know how to pitch he knows how to attack a hitter

5901199 i bought my camera here i expected ritz would be able to help me with small things like this
5901200 it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statues
5901201 there was a time when i struggled with what appeared to the senslessness of it all but the reality of the goodness of god and then the experience of the work of god in lives through jeremys suffering has resonated with the truths of scripture it is real this is what the world needs to see a real god transforming real lives in the most intense of situations
5901202 where were you when i laid the foundation of the earth
5901203 have you commanded the morning since your days began and caused the dawn to know its place
5901204 as i see it jeremy has been full time in the ministry for the last 14 years it was not the ministry he would have chosen or any of us would have chosen for him but he gave up the right to choose how god would use him sometime along the way and i know he wanted what god wanted for him he is a great example for all of us
5901205 i want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel
5901206 the deepest moments of spiritual fellowship with the living christ are at times of intense suffering suffering drives believers to him they find in him a merciful high priest a faithful friend who feels their pain and a sympathetic companion who faced all the trials and temptations that they face heb 4 15 he is thus uniquely qualified to help them in their weaknesses and infirmities heb 2 17
5901207 do the janzs fear god for nothing do those who know and love this boy simply believe in a feel good god
5901208 god is the highest good of the reasonable creature and the enjoyment of him is the only happiness with which our souls can be satisfied to go to heaven fully to enjoy god is infinitely better than the most pleasant accommodations here fathers and mothers husbands wives children or the company of earthly friends are but shadows but the enjoyment of god is the substance these are but scattered beams but god is the sun these are but streams but god is the fountain these are but drops but god is the ocean therefore it becomes us to spend this life only as a journey towards heaven as it becomes us to make the seeking of our highest end and proper good the whole work of our lives to which we should subordinate all other concerns of life why should we labor for or set our hearts on anything else but that which is our proper end and true happiness

5901256 we are just trying to make sure that we have the financing in place so that as the details are worked out specifically relative to the projects that money or the funding of it will not be a hinderance to timely completion
5901257 its our expectation that it will not be that much we went on what we think at this point to be a high dollar amount
5901258 quite honestly the state is the really big money spender in this project its definitely a joint effort with the state being a major player and the city and county stepping up as well

5901269 life is so unpredictable and can so easily distract and derail you from your plans
5901270 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5901271 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5901272 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5901273 the home entertainment service market in spite of serving close to 120 million tv households for decades has still not delivered the quality choice and service experience leading to customer delight
5901274 there are only six million pay tv dth homes and this will grow ten times to 60 million by 2012 the market is likely to grow to 17 18 million in a year and we plan to have a 40 per cent share of this market at the end of 12 months
5901275 aiims is a renowned research institution the children must have died because they were already very ill
5901276 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded since january 1 2006
5901277 these include deaths both in the control and intervention groups
5901278 after a faculty review meeting of all available data we found that none of the deaths can be attributed to drugs
5901279 as the clinical trial market is increasing in india we have stipulated a separate provision in the bill to ensure that best practices are followed while conducting trials earlier we had guidelines on how trials need to be conducted soon we will have a law
5901280 no trials can be conducted without permission from the drugs controller general the provisions are presently being studied by the parliamentary standing committee once it approves and returns the bill we will place it again before parliament
5901281 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistamines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion antihistamines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day
5901282 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the next day when least expected
5901283 that ambulance officer had no backup whatsoever from the nsw ambulance service contrary to its own policy
5901284 so police at the scene were asked to drive the ambulance to maitland hospital while the patient in the back was treated by the lone ambulance officer
5901285 this highlights again that the ambulance service works contrary to its own policy which puts patients and ambulance officers at risk
5901286 this matter of single ambulance officers at cessnock and nelson bay is before the industrial relations commission
5901287 the commission is now deliberating on this matter and its decision is expected soon
5901288 in another incident in newcastle last week a single officer arrived at a domestic situation
5901289 the ambulance officer requested backup and was told by the ambulance service that no backup was available
5901290 these two incidents highlight what the hsu has been saying and the evidence it has taken to the industrial relations commission
5901291 we have told the commission that these situations occur quite frequently to the detriment of patient care and of the ambulance officers
5901292 we hope the commission makes the appropriate decision based on the evidence given to it by the hsu
5901293 how are these officers expected to care for a patient and transport them to hospital
5901294 it is of great credit to the police that they drove that ambulance and they did a good job
5901295 we are asking for public assistance to locate the three children thought to have been sleeping in the dumpster at maitland
5901296 after 11am on monday police attended a local store in maitland cbd where staff had discovered a mattress blankets and pillows in an industrial bin
5901297 the store employees said the youngsters were poorly dressed and had been seen in the area over the past two weeks
5901298 the four year old boy is described as having a shaved head the six year old boy sported a mullet style haircut and we have no description of the girl
5901299 the report that three children may have been living in a bin has prompted serious concern from local retailers docs and police
5901300 although we cannot confirm that the children were living in the bin concerns remain that they were reportedly in the area on school days were not dressed for winter weather and were without any adult supervision
5901301 the situation came to light when one of our people threw a cardboard box into the bin and a little voice cried out
5901302 then a child jumped out and asked can you give us something
5901303 we are questioning him on the details of other locals involved in the terror attack
5901304 at that point the georgian leadership told some of us we have no choice but to defend our villages and our people and lift the cease fire our message remained the same that we understand the predicament you face
5901305 but we strongly recommend that you not engage in a direct military conflict with russia because that is unwinnable
5901306 were not trying to issue vague empty threats or wag our finger but simply stating the fact that this military operation has imposed a serious cost on russia in terms of its standing in the world
5901307 thats not as good thing its not something that we relish its not something that we want to see happen

5901319 this is the olympic games i didnt even consider it as an option
5901320 the target was within my reach i was in good shape in fact i was in better shape than what i was in athens where she jumped 6 83 her best so far for the sixth place the conditions were very good it is very disappointing to finish like this
5901321 i dont know whether i will be able to jump in the london olympics in 2012 i will be there for the commonwealth games in delhi and the asian games that is the plan for now
5901322 i think its important that people realize that the olympic games can be gamed
5901323 its their way of showing see our system the chinese communist party put our country on top of the gold medals chart
5901324 act as a single entity in licensing their intellectual property
5901325 when making a single entity determination courts must examine whether the conduct in question deprives the marketplace of the independent sources of economic control that competition assumes
5901326 simply put nothing in section 1 prohibits the nfl teams from cooperating so the league can compete against other entertainment providers indeed antitrust law encourages cooperation inside a business organization such as in this case a professional sports league to foster competition between that organization and its competitors
5901327 everyone will understand why liu xiang had to abandon competition
5901328 we hope he will relax and focus on recovery we hope that after he recovers he will continue to train hard and struggle harder for the national glory
5901329 theres so many people concerned about me and who support me i feel very sorry
5901330 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights

5901335 whether it is automobile emissions reduction or construction site dust reduction or coal pollution reduction i believe that the requirements will be more stringent
5901336 price of two and three wheeler tyres for the replacement market has also been increased by 14 even then many a products have to be sold below the production cost
5901337 how many times can you go to the market and revise prices
5901338 whenever we have tried to ramp up our production in sahaganj there has been a problem i dont know whether it is a genuine technical problem or a created one but we dont have any evidence in hand about problems being purposely created
5901339 in terms of the initial objective these public housing programs have been a conspicuous failure the public housing units themselves have frequently become slums and hotbeds of crime especially juvenile delinquency
5901340 the repeated failure of well intentioned programs is not an accident it is not simply the result of mistakes of execution the failure is deeply rooted in the use of bad means to achieve good objectives
5901341 under the section 8 federal housing voucher program thousands of poor urban and often african american residents have left hardscrabble neighborhoods in the nations largest cities and resettled in the suburbs law enforcement experts and housing researchers argue that rising crime rates follow section 8 recipients to their new homes while other experts discount any direct link but there is little doubt that cultural shock waves have followed the migration
5901342 they found its condition to be filthy and messy week old dishes were piled in the kitchen sink and on top of the stove and the kitchen floor was covered with spilled food and garbage
5901343 there seems to be an idea rattling around driven by concerns about global warming that we need to stop building roads and using cars and take to public transport to save the planet
5901344 after the second world war we established a car industry and started developing new suburbs first at the end of our radial rail lines and more recently far beyond the reach of the rail and bus systems
5901345 it was not just transport it was fun now i calculate it costs me 6 for a round trip to werribee plaza
5901346 this is an exciting year for broadcasting in china as local audience interest in the olympic games is at an unprecedented level
5901347 we are very pleased to have envivio as an encoder partner as they have shown strong commitment to the chinese market with their early implementation of the avs standard

5901354 their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5901355 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5901356 there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5901357 the change may mean more assessments of the situation but time is running out to stage the event or move it elsewhere
5901358 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan whereas the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5901359 it was an amazing feeling my dad had fixed it up for me i think it cost a fiver
5901360 he probably trains the hardest of anybody and hes very strict with himself but hes also a good guy he can turn off the competitive thing now and then and have a good laugh hes an inspiration
5901361 hes only human and hes got strengths and weaknesses well maybe not weaknesses maybe just weaker strengths but every time you do a personal best in training he gets up and beats it
5901362 you have to be very very careful about when you eat and when you rest
5901363 you get as much sleep as you can and you remind yourself that your opponents are having to do exactly the same as you so when youre tiring theyre tiring as well
5901364 i think the older you get the smarter you get you know the signs your body gives ive got stronger over the years ill have to take my foot off the gas pedal a little bit next year and try and build up for the london olympics but i feel very positive and im lucky i love what i do
5901365 i wouldnt be standing here with any medals round my neck if the meadowbank velodrome hadnt existed so who knows how many potential future olympic champions are out there why not built more facilities rather than knocking them down its about getting kids on bikes and into sport
5901366 these vegetables expired in 2005 but they were from the freezer so i cooked them anyway

5901369 paes has stepped down only for the tie against romania we will review the situation after that he decided that it was in the best interests of the country to field our strongest challenge and that he did not want to be a hindrance to that
5901370 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5901371 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5901372 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones
5901373 for me its kind of like the first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than two years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5901374 i mean the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four i dont know what their reasons are i didnt ask and i didnt care im just glad to be here and im glad they gave me a day to pitch which is friday
5901375 well put him in friday hell be pitching every five days from there
5901376 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5901377 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5901378 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned
5901379 the thing about greg he keeps everything so simple people like to make things more complicated than they need to be you learn a lot the way he approaches the game
5901380 weve had people in the ballpark his last three starts
5901381 hes pitched very well hes got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there he know how to pitch he knows how to attack a hitter

5901390 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5901391 there is so much fear in the residential market im glad i dont have product out there right now
5901392 i havent seen a market like this since the early 80s there is a lot of confusion a lot of fear
5901393 boy its just really tough thats not saying its impossible but if the project depends on selling condos to succeed youve got a rough road ahead
5901394 were probably doing better than most of the rest of the condo projects are
5901395 but im glad we didnt build any more than eight of them
5901396 an iconic product in the heart of bend its not sitting in downtown portland competing with hundreds of other projects just like it
5901397 the bend market has been hit hard theres no question about it
5901398 still this is just my crystal ball and its no better than any other crystal ball i think bend will be one of those markets that will bounce back faster than most because of the overall intrinsic quality of living rhere
5901399 their underwriting requirements have become such that its very prohibitive to do a deal
5901400 what they are really doing is taking away your tools
5901401 the reasons we set out to do the mercato still exist
5901402 some of these guys are sticking their heads between their tails and running
5901403 i have no doubt that bend is still going to be ahead of the game once things start to pick up
5901404 the market is saying there is more bad news to come
5901405 o ur local settings and cultural values in other words our context influence how we read gods word

5901416 the wind was blowing this fireball and it was just setting all the grass on fire
5901417 it blew it right up into the back of our warehouse where we had some trailers parked and some other equipment out there
5901418 it was a miracle it did not get into our warehouse thank goodness because it would have gone off
5901419 we store all of potlatchs clothing and their poly wrap and we make deliveries to them every day but all of that was safe and it didnt get into the warehouse
5901420 i just want to praise the lewiston firefighters and all of them that came in to help from clarkston and asotin
5901421 it saved our warehouse because it could have burned the coca cola warehouse it could have burned on to p amp p truck and trailer repair which are our neighbors and maybe even the super 8 motel and the flying j because of the way the storm was going and the wind was blowing

5901428 we are most grateful for all of the prayers and support we have received
5901429 he came over for a couple of weeks a couple of years ago
5901430 i was glad he did it it was kind of an honor for us
5901431 he could run the bases he could hit for average he could hit for power he could hit your best pitch and he could hit your worst pitch i just tried to keep the ball in the ballpark against him sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt
5901432 i dont think he became the most talented of the hall of famers but no one outworked him
5901433 up until the day he retired he wanted to be the best he spent hours and hours and hours hitting

5901459 seeing our work displayed in the tate modern was overwhelming not many kids our age know how that feels
5901460 i was in a car accident involving our car a petrol tanker and a van because of my injuries the paramedics decided to call for the air ambulance hospital bed when i got to hospital i was told that i had broken my left femur thigh bone i was put in traction for five and a half weeks which meant i had to stay in a hospital bed all that time then i was sent home in a cast for four and a half weeks the reason i raise money for the air ambulance is because they rely on funding from members of the public who do fundraising or make donations they do not get any money from the government this is my way of saying thank you for taking me to hospital the way i raise funds is by attending local events with a tombola stall and we also sell air ambulance products important job in total my family and i have raised about 3 000 and hope to raise much more in the future i think that the air ambulance is very important because it saves peoples lives after accidents
5901461 are you a cyclist who is tired of constantly being overlooked by drivers being stared at through car windows or being told off for going on the pavement well me too where i live there is a big busy main road on the way to school in which there is luckily a cycle path grassy field but when we get closer the cars park in the cycle path this leaves us cyclists to either have to pick up tons of speed and try and get up the curve onto the big grassy field next to the road or jet out over the speed bumps on this busy fast moving main road i dont mind people just stopping on the cycle path to drop off their children and make sure they get safely into school but these people sit in the cars sometimes for up to half an hour just smoking beeping as if this is not bad enough to try and avoid any trouble with cars we cross over to the other side of the road so that we are now cycling on the right side where we get people beeping at us roads need to be made safer for cyclists and quick
5901462 part of my prize for winning the young photographer award 2007 was a photo shoot with rspca chief photographer andrew forsyth i was invited to the rspca east winch wildlife centre near kings lynn in norfolk where lots of animals are rescued and looked after especially seals but also foxes swans hedgehogs and birds and i got exclusive access to behind the scenes nervous the day started with me my dad and andrew all geared up with cameras and ready to rumble the keepers caught and weighed the seals the ones that had achieved the required weight gain were fastened into a hammock and hooked into the back of a land rover i was allowed to travel in the land rover it was quite funny when one of the seals sneezed right at me great place we drove to the release site on a tidal river where it was very muddy and i got my foot stuck and nearly fell over but andrew and i managed to position ourselves in a great place to watch and photograph the four seals being released they slid from the hammock down a mudslide to the river which was quite comical it was a wonderful experience and a great privilege to be part of the release although it was sad to see them go i didnt want to leave isolation unit after lunch we were taken round the isolation unit where we had to dress in white overalls and white wellies i looked ridiculous as everything was too big for me we then went into the barn the seals are moved into here from the isolation unit before being put in the outdoor pools we also went into an outdoor netted area where injured swans are kept it was all great memories it was a long but exciting and moving day and i will always treasure the memories from it and i have some brilliant photos too

5901476 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat
5901477 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
5901478 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
5901479 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
5901480 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
5901481 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were gong to be able to make a deal
5901482 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
5901483 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
5901484 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
5901485 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
5901486 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
5901487 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5901488 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5901489 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5901490 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5901491 well just try to match up the best way we can
5901492 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out
5901493 i do not necessarily determine the role the relief pitcher determines the role
5901494 im considering everybody from the gulf coast league to triple a can any of yall throw
5901495 the reality is true proven guys are not going to get through
5901496 i feel comfortable that the answer when billys not here is in that room
5901497 the guys in there are going to have to step up i think weve got the guys
5901498 were not the only team that goes through this and we have to find a way to get it done

5901503 estamos contentos pero no hemos hecho todav a nada ahora vamos a por el oro
5901504 ha sido un partido b rbaro todos est bamos muy felices no esperaba ganar una semifinal ol mpica as y menos contra brasil cuando pudimos hacer un gol todo fue mucho m s f cil
5901505 no baj al vestuario porqu creo que lo sacaron en volandas del palco
5901506 importamos nosotros que tenemos que mejorar algunos detalles mejor dicho detallazos
5901507 el equipo que quiero es el de la primera parte
5901508 en la primera parte hemos jugado bien hemos tenido ocasiones para matar el partido hemos tenido profundidad y posesi n del bal n este es el equipo que quiero
5901509 hubo la circunstancia de la expulsi n pero pese a eso no nos han creado peligro
5901510 el trabajo de la defensa ha estado muy bien el gol es un error puntual individual
5901511 en la primera parte hemos visto al equipo que quiero el equipo ha estado sensacional tras la expulsi n el equipo ha hecho un trabajo muy bueno
5901512 hace dos semanas corr y me encontraba bien despu s lleg la lesi n las cosas se me torcieron quer a participar pero no pude el dolor era insoportable de competir habr a arriesgado mi tend n no tengo palabras para explicar como me sent en ese momento
5901513 cuando estaba en la zona de calentando ya no me encontraba bien sab a que algo no funcionaba que mi pie no me permitir a correr
5901514 fuera inevitable no soy de ese tipo de personas que arrojan la toalla volver a competir
5901515 si quer is a arshavin por 15 millones nosotros compraremos a messi por 20
5901516 i have a hard time believing that there is a better defensive back in the country against the run or on the blitz than woodson
5901517 pero hasta el 30 de agosto no se conocer su futuro
5901518 ojal podamos obtener un buen rendimiento de joaqu n para que se pueda pensar en cualquier momento en esa mejora de contrato
5901519 lo l gico ahora es hablar con fernando g mez por si sigue adelante lo que se dijo entonces
5901520 que tenga la cabeza donde la debe tener despu s de lo que ha pasado pues en tres meses joaqu n ha estado dentro fuera dentro fuera

5901546 death and destruction on a cosmic scale planets dying species going extinct being resurrected and then being erased from all of time and space all the universes every universe in peril with paradoxes stacking on top of one another and rifts forming where there shouldnt be rifts

5901586 don manuel debe operarse y quiere cerrar ya la plantilla
5901587 la liga se nos viene encima y no llegan los fichajes
5901588 don manuel quiere cerrar la plantilla ya porque tiene que operarse
5901589 the army officers are friendly and are generous and i really enjoyed their company
5901590 they are just like ordinary people the only difference is that they were the green uniforms
5901591 i want to acknowledge their work in maintaining law and order in the country
5901592 estoy contento por l porque yo he tenido la suerte de estar con pep en la selecci n fue un pedazo de jugador de los que m s clase han tenido en la selecci n
5901593 por c mo ve el f tbol y por todo lo que ha significado para el barcelonismo creo que es el entrenador perfecto para el bar a
5901594 hacerte una idea de un equipo por la pretemporada no es una visi n real nosotros estuvimos muy mal el a o pasado y luego ganamos la liga
5901595 es posible construir un coche empleando exclusivamente el simulador sin necesidad de utilizar un t nel de viento a escala podemos elaborar m dulos del coche a trav s de la computadora y estudiar despu s su comportamiento es decir llevar a cabo el proceso completo de desarrollo de un coche sin construirlo en el momento que realmente estamos satisfechos del producto se empieza la construcci n
5901596 la correlaci n entre la realidad y la informaci n que nos ofrece el simulador es incre ble gracias a un programa que incluye todas las especificaciones y los resultados que se obtienen en la pista
5901597 en t rminos de velocidad es muy preciso en largas rectas quiz s puede haber una diferencia de 1 o 2 km h
5901598 nuestro trabajo consiste en probar piezas concretas para comprobar las que funcionan y las que no es lo realmente interesante para el negocio desde el punto de vista de la ingenier a porque as no tienes que fabricarlas hasta que est s seguro de que funcionan
5901599 en el simulador ves perfectamente cuando un piloto es bueno o es brillante todas las diferencias que puedes encontrar en un circuito las ves aqu si tienes un piloto extremadamente r pido que nunca tiene accidentes en el simulador ser lo mismo podr dar una vuelta detr s de otra sin sufrir ning n percance contra las barreras
5901600 poseer un simulador es rentable cuando se utiliza ma ana tarde y noche con diferentes pilotos claro pero hoy en d a es una locura que un equipo de f1 no tenga uno
5901601 las escuder as son muy celosas de sus datos es decir quieren que sus pilotos prueben el simulador pero sin facilitarnos la informaci n de su monoplaza por lo que corren con un programa est ndard de este modo el simulador s lo les sirve para que sus pilotos ganen experiencia y conozcan los secretos de todos los circuitos algo que resulta muy til en el caso sobre todo de los m s j venes
5901602 si ganas el mundial te importa que te haga una bandera
5901603 pues tambi n quiero que me d la bandera cuando gane un mundial
5901604 me siento muy honrado de poder tener compa eros como dani y kim en espa a valentino est muy fuerte pero casey y dani son dos grandes pilotos a los que no hay que olvidar
5901605 he hablado con hicks y me ha comentado que tenemos dinero suficiente para fichar me pregunt cosas sobre el equipo y me dijo que hay dinero y que habr m s si somos capaces de vender a algunos jugadores para tener recursos estamos en ello
5901606 as of today we are the largest sandwich delivery company in the nation
5901607 this launch springboards dominos into the lunch business by providing a product that is high quality priced right and aimed at convenience minded people without a lot of time of course sandwiches are also available any time our stores are open
5901608 some of our sandwich competitors use units that look like microwaves or toaster ovens to try and warm a few of their subs we have high end ovens in our stores that cost 30 000 and bake our sandwiches at 450 degrees it gives us a huge quality advantage they cant match
5901609 people fed up with brown bagging or driving to pick up something cold can save some time and gas by ordering a hot dominos sandwich for delivery to their home or office

5901613 its 50 000 per night or 175 000 for the week
5901614 if its you or me looking to rent thats a tremendous amount of money but for other people its just not as much money as you think
5901615 i think this is probably better than what oprahs getting
5901616 you get 6 bedrooms 8 000 square feet to work with and it provides a lot of flexibility you can park as many cars as you want on the property and you have some privacy were on a 320 acre farm and so that acreage really give you some serenity some privacy
5901617 its certainly not walking distance but for someone who would rent this the odds are theyre probably not driving themselves
5901618 sorry to wake you but there is a fire in the building everyone needs to get out
5901619 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5901620 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call

5901622 if we look at individual hospitals then there is an increase in the number of patients in the last 15 20 years these have grown five to 10 fold in my hospital itself
5901623 we can only guess that diet smoking alcohol consumption and obesity could be the reasons behind the disease
5901624 but in most cases its ruled out as the disease is already in an advanced stage
5901625 it will help patients get information from the best in the field what makes it more relevant is that it will be totally in an indian context
5901626 the consumer lending market has moved beyond recognition lending markets are currently beset by high market uncertainties with the ongoing credit crunch falling house prices rising arrears and repossessions and indebted consumers struggling to find credit
5901627 predominately its the miners dragging us up and the banks still lagging
5901628 in the last couple of days weve had both the resources and the banks giving us grief but today weve got the resource stocks bouncing quite sharply
5901629 bhp after its good profit got slaughtered yesterday but today after the bounce in commodity prices its up

5901638 mortgage choice is confident that it is well placed to achieve another successful year in fiscal 2009
5901639 most lenders mortgage interest rates were increased independently of the reserve bank by approximately 60 basis points and mortgage lending policies were tightened all of which had a profound effect on the australian mortgage market
5901640 for us queensland and victoria outperformed the larger new south wales market in this reporting period
5901641 the fact that we now have less reliance on new south wales is also a major plus in terms of earnings resilience given the continued subdued nature of the new south wales economy
5901642 western australian house price growth has plateaued while the south australian market showed strong growth after lagging behind other states for some time
5901643 recent trading for the australian casino businesses has been satisfactory with total revenue excluding vip commission based play to 14 august up four per cent on last year
5901644 year on year growth in vip commission program play has been strong over the same period
5901645 the past year has been one of significant activity with the most important event being the separation of crown and pbl into two separately listed companies
5901646 this result was achieved despite the introduction of full smoking bans in bars on the main gaming floor and an increase in the victorian gaming machine levy during the year
5901647 crown melbourne and burswood further cemented their leadership position in the australian casino industry
5901648 mpel is on track to open city of dreams in the first half of 2009
5901649 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
5901650 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
5901651 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
5901652 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
5901653 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
5901654 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
5901655 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
5901656 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
5901657 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
5901658 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
5901659 gary thanks for choosing me and inviting other rational conservatives to do the same
5901660 the army officers are friendly and are generous and i really enjoyed their company
5901661 they are just like ordinary people the only difference is that they were the green uniforms
5901662 i want to acknowledge their work in maintaining law and order in the country
5901663 i look forward to our training camp and then our match against uzbekistan which is when it all begins
5901664 this was a good chance to look at all the players for me
5901665 scott has good experience and has a good feel for space
5901666 he is also very comfotable on the ball im happy he could play 45 minutes and in september hell be ready for 90 minutes
5901667 every player wants to play in the world cup but first we have to concentrate on the qualifying games and scott wants to be there we have eleven spots up for grabs we have three weeks to go and anything can happen
5901668 i will wait until our training camp and then make up my mind but i know who is capable of what and have some ideas the defence is not a concern but the defensive organisation is not good yet
5901669 benni knows how to hold the ball and how to bring the three midfielders into the game
5901670 i hope he will be a regular over the next two years but football is always a surprise i wanted him for the previous games but it was not possible
5901671 how in the hell coult it be your fault did you hold the drink to their mouth and make them drink did you give them the keys and make them drive drunk multipul times
5901672 i have sinned i drank i drove i have ruined my kids life i have done these things what happens to me i fully deserve and probably more
5901673 brazil always has dreamed of the gold too bad we never seem to win it well just have to wait another four years
5901674 the argentine locker room overflowed in euphoria it was fifteen minutes of craziness
5901675 the boys gave them everything they could aguero exploded riquelme destroyed them messi too and we have a team that goes in strong to the finals
5901676 its especially difficult because it was argentina its difficult to lose at any time but to lose to argentina is a tremendous shame
5901677 brazil didnt show the spirit and objectivity demonstrated by argentina its that simple the defeat was deserved
5901678 generally its a pretty unfriendly environment for anything thats not a treasury note
5901679 but in terms of the ultimate credit worthiness of agencies and their ability and willingness to pay off on all their debt obligations that position is stronger now than it was a year ago
5901680 the big story right now is to what extent will the asians continue to support the gse debt
5901681 if the asians dont play who are we going to get as a replacement
5901682 we operated successfully in the most volatile agricultural and energy markets in decades
5901683 despite tight stocks of many agricultural commodities we maintained reliable supply chains for our customers
5901684 cargill is expected to hold and maintain much larger grain positions and that requires a lot of borrowing and financial acumen
5901685 the company is starting to show it can grow at a reasonable rate
5901686 investors may wait a little longer to get excited about the story but it does show something good is happening
5901687 weve been able to maintain our 20 percent market share in the face of a full landscape of competitors that translates a bit to what were going to see here in the u s
5901688 they said that their tv producer wanted me to be interviewed for a documentary on eco fashion
5901689 i talked to one of their producers and she told me that 84 million people were going to see this she said it would be on pbs cnn that its going to be aired all over europe
5901690 i didnt know what to say my store doesnt have that kind of money
5901691 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess

5901693 heath ledgers will left nothing to his former girlfriend and their 2 year old daughter because it was filed in australia in 2003 and never updated after they became part of his life the associated press reported a copy of the will filed in manhattan surrogates court shows that mr ledger a native of australia left everything to his parents and three sisters
5901694 heath ledgers estate why daughter matilda who was left nothing in her fathers will might have a claim to everything
5901695 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls

5901721 its a devastating thing to be exposed and youre publicly shamed we would go to great effort to keep the victims names out but defendants names are right there in the san francisco chronicle all the time

5901728 he was concerned that would be true of every case of child porn that came before him and that would be an irrational way to discuss detention other people committed suicide so we have to keep you in custody for your own protection
5901729 he looked for some assurances that a therapist had seen the person involved and that the person would be able to cope with the social humiliation with this sort of crime
5901730 its definitely a concern a serious concern among magistrate judges weve taken steps to initiate discussions with the pretrial services office and other magistrate judges and the probation office
5901731 to develop a process for screening these cases when they first come in to determine whether there should be immediate referral to mental health counseling and any consequential testing at the outset as a condition of release

5901745 from eureka to ekalaka from sanders county to sydney from shelby down to red lodge montana communities are struggling to house their people
5901746 keeping the systems up to snuff is an expensive proposition
5901747 if you have a community these days thats spread out all over the place youre looking at huge energy costs
5901748 when we lose those mobile home courts were losing affordable housing that cant easily be replaced
5901749 unnecessary costs and be contrary to the growth policy goals and objectives to accommodate community growth
5901750 losing density upsizing homes providing additional open space common area and common area maintenance etc add to the cost of the project the increased costs are forward shifted to the homebuyer
5901751 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day de rossi told the magazine

5901756 if you recently received an e mail stating your account will expire soon or you saw similar messaging while using mobileme please ignore it
5901757 the launch of mobileme was not our finest hour mobileme was simply not up to apples standards and it clearly needed more time and testing there are several things we could have done better
5901758 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
5901759 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
5901760 the driver allegedly refused to pull over and led police on a pursuit along dirt roads and through vacant blocks through the industrial area a police spokeswoman said

5901762 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5901763 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5901764 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5901765 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5901766 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5901767 two things are necessary one is the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks we have not seen that happen yet and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again
5901768 predominately its the miners dragging us up and the banks still lagging
5901769 in the last couple of days weve had both the resources and the banks giving us grief but today weve got the resource stocks bouncing quite sharply
5901770 bhp after its good profit got slaughtered yesterday but today after the bounce in commodity prices its up
5901771 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5901772 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5901773 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves

5901799 no se pueden desconocer las potestades sancionatorias que la ley confiere a las autoridades en particular a los prestadores de servicios p blicos domiciliarios en materia administrativa
5901800 sanciones que el ordenamiento legal rector de los servicios p blicos domiciliarios consagra a favor de las empresas prestadoras de los mismos
5901801 las empresas carecen de la facultad de imponer sanciones pecuniarias en la forma en que lo se al la creg en el art culo 54 de la resoluci n 108 de 1997 raz n por la cual dicha norma ser anulada
5901802 la posibilidad de que la entidad de regulaci n autorice a las empresas prestadoras de servicios p blicos la adopci n de medidas sancionatorias menos de car cter patrimonial

5901825 todav a est n vigentes los controles a los capitales de corto plazo pero estudiamos una norma para permitir el ingreso a renta variable con el buen cuidado de que no migren hacia renta fija
5901826 ha habido demasiados amagues sobre el tema y el mercado se entusiasma pero nada se concreta
5901827 los mayores interesados en que se desmonte el control de capitales son los inversionistas internacionales que s est n interesados en llegar al pa s
5901828 invertir es bueno cuando se puede vender y si las restricciones se mantienen los extranjeros no van a llegar
5901829 vemos una probabilidad de entre 60 y 70 por ciento de que los controles a los capitales extranjeros para la compra de acciones locales sean levantados antes del fin del a o principalmente para evitar el riesgo de que colombia sea degradado de mercado emergente a mercado de frontera en el indice msci que rastrea la evoluci n de los mercados burs tiles del mundo si el pa s es retirado de ese ndice eso implicar a un gran choque con el inter s del presidente uribe de mostrar que colombia es un pa s que est abierto a la inversi n productiva extranjera como un instrumento para reducir los umbrales de pobreza

5901836 las fuertes bajas de las tasas de inter s y los reembolsos de impuestos hasta ahora permitieron a la econom a estadounidense evitar la recesi n

5901854 sometimes i cry sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of healing
5901855 i think theres always a concern that when you bring in new people that you limit your time with the old people i think that the producers have done a very good job this year of balancing that i think they understood that when we were all separated in the second season the fans werent too into that when you bring in a new character bring him in with a reason bring him in with a purpose dont just pack it with a bunch of new faces that nobody knows
5901856 that was always one of those things that had such a huge mystery behind it i think every scene that we do were discovering more than what we had just talked about arthurs such a complicated character he impacts everybody for his own need or want to be important and be the most powerful
5901857 a lot of it is a bit of pride and a bit of grain and salt you feel proud that theyre talking about it youre excited by the fact that theyre talking about it but also you know that if you sit around and read everything that you see online its like man your going to spend a lot of time doing that personally id like to show up at work and then go be with my family and friends
5901858 we are making a conscious effort to reshape the colleges structure to better correspond with the administrative offices of the faculty of arts and sciences
5901859 this integration of roles will help the college and fas to better coordinate our activities priorities and strategic planning as importantly this is an early step in the process of thinking about new ways to knit together undergraduate academics and student services so as to enrich our students experiences both inside and outside the classroom
5901860 i can think of no more qualified candidate than georgene herschbach to serve as dean for administration in harvard college
5901861 during her lengthy service to harvard she has held leadership roles in many of the offices that will now report to her i am thrilled that she has agreed to serve in this important capacity
5901862 i am gratified that georgene herschbach will be right down the hall sharing her wisdom and vast knowledge of harvard i am certain that her influence will continue to be felt in all aspects of the undergraduate curriculum even as she moves into a new set of duties
5901863 noel bissons new role as a key player in shaping and guiding our undergraduate programs reflects her passion for liberal arts education and its importance in todays world
5901864 she brings to this position both administrative savvy and a keen interest in our students honed by her experience as a teacher and adviser
5901865 i am delighted to welcome noel back to the office of undergraduate education and look forward to working with her on many aspects of the undergraduate experience her wealth of experience and insight as well as her demonstrated administrative skills will be invaluable as we move forward

5901870 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5901871 we are worried the fcc will buckle and allow white space to be used by personal portable devices seeking wireless services
5901872 the radio frequency environment is going to become more crowded and more difficult to use
5901873 in that case the number of wireless microphones used will be reduced significantly and it cost big productions millions of dollars to redesign what they do
5901874 everybody is not only angry and upset they are very very worried
5901875 from the beginning we have said that no white space device should come to market unless the fcc signs off on it
5901876 we have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as fcc licenses that we have had to get

5901911 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5901912 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002

5901933 the bluefluid surf racks are simple and quick to fit i had the racks and boards on the car in 5 minutes they worked perfectly on the weekend to carry 3 boards on our 2 door car we are about one and a half hours from the beach and most of that is freeway driving the boards stayed right where they should at 100km h
5901934 vamos a tomar las plantas cementeras porque se acab el plazo y pasan a manos del estado como pas con la sider rgica del orinoco sidor como pas con la faja del orinoco como pas con la compa a nacional de tel fonos de venezuela cantv todos son pasos al socialismo

5901937 ya tenemos bajo control del estado venezolano todas las plantas de cemex a nivel nacional se han cumplido los extremos de la ley
5901938 and thats how we get competitive in the indianas and virginias
5901939 thats why i pay more attention to the registration figures than to the polls i see at this time of year
5901940 the polls will change but we know we need 200 000 new voters to be competitive in georgia and now is when we have to get them
5901941 the big difference this year is not the technology its the coordination
5901942 hey look at this surprising development the guy with more money is being outspent because hes foolishly and riskily airing tv ads in lesser battlegrounds
5901943 patrick got it right when he argued during the campaign that rather than debating whether we should raise or lower taxes we should first consider what we want to do and then discuss how to pay for it in that spirit those of us who were with him from the beginning are saying that it is time to talk
5901944 one reason these progressives are feeling marginalized might lie in their lack of unanimity on the issues it was easy to feel united and effective on an issue like gay marriage says boston progressive politician matt omalley because all the progressive groups were working together on it its been hard to find other issues that bring the left together in the same way that leaves progressives often splintered working at cross purposes or fighting losing causes
5901945 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge in that our stores are fun and unique and we have both what you need and what you want
5901946 so were still trying to define and find the right balance between expect more pay less the current environment means that the focus is squarely on the pay less side of it
5901947 we understand that guests sometimes equate clean well designed stores and fast and friendly service with higher prices
5901948 but we believe guests can have a superior shopping experience and save money by increasing communication to our guests about our value and convenience we will ensure they turn to target for their needs and wants
5901949 delivering the newness innovative design and exceptional quality that target is known for
5901950 the current environment is the harshest we have seen in many years
5901951 in the short term its going to remain challenging and i just dont really expect to see the traffic trends change until we see a stronger economic climate in the u s and so were planning our business cautiously
5901952 one thing our neighborhoods have struggled with since the storm is trying to determine whos back and what do they need to do to get back home
5901953 thats a lot of work for a neighborhood leader to take on when theyre trying to rebuild their own home data and tools like this allow the neighborhood to do more with their very limited resources
5901954 the rest of the block just looks like a prairie
5901955 since the storm nothing was easy and we couldnt believe they just had a snapshot in time of june 2005
5901956 it was really such a gift to us because it allows us to put the current numbers of households receiving mail in context
5901957 where valassis really put themselves out there for the greater good is that they let us publish the technical details of how their mailing list works and doesnt work for this application
5901958 its documented in enough detail that another city could follow it and ramp up rather quickly
5901959 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him
5901960 la nota de protesta incluye la protesta formal al gobierno de nicaragua por dar asilo a una terrorista presunta guerrillera de las farc
5901961 al final de la nota de protesta nosotros decimos como lo dec a el presidente que esas personas como todas las que deseen desmovilizarse podr n obtener los beneficios eventuales que tenga esa desmovilizaci n
5901962 your pain is my pain my wealth is your wealth your salvation is my salvation
5901963 i am however tibetan before i am dalai lama and i am human before i am tibetan
5901964 the richest person is the one who is contented with what he has
5901965 watch and learn son or youll be passing wrenches for the rest of your life

5901968 in the days when the audience is shrinking you have to grow your business
5901969 was recently accompanied by an alltel sponsor logo and logo is prominently displayed on screen during foxs
5901970 not just our logo with the box scores but some interactivity to it
5901971 we have discussed it internally but so far we have resisted
5901972 theres a dancing act going on internally with advertising trying to figure out an appropriate way not to hurt the viewing experience
5901973 the shopping cart had the logo but it didnt say target or shop tomorrow
5901974 they wanted it to be subtle and thats why we went with it because it didnt seem to distract
5901975 we are trying to remove clutter to make sure viewers have the best possible experience if we start placing ads we will lose the value of promotions as a navigation tool
5901976 when we hit on the right program and marry it with the right ad it could happen but its not on the docket right now
5901977 i understand the networks are trying to monetize content and advertisers want their message to be seen but no one ever seems to think about the viewer
5901978 it detracts from the program theyre covering part of the screen
5901979 i think even if people are watching a national weather warning they dont like losing part of their screen to things that have nothing to do with the show
5901980 it appears that on average 10 of information delivered in the visually complex condition did not get through to long term memory due to visual complexity
5901981 there is no explanation that justifies using a presentational format for news that makes it more difficult for viewers than it already is the data strongly suggest that the format harms story fact comprehension thus this cacophonous format appears to be one that can and should be better managed by television news producers
5901982 cognitive theory shows that people cant take in two messages they go back and forth
5901983 you are not taking away from the emotional engagement some networks put them in the middle of the action some at the end of the segment the problem is we dont know how to measure pushback is it when ratings go down we dont know where the boundary is until we cross it
5901984 you have to factor in duration is it an icon is it a link to information how impactful is it how prominent what show is it on the disadvantage is that you are in competition with the content of the program
5901985 if youre new here you may want to subscribe to my rss feed thanks for visiting
5901986 it involves having great interpersonal skills an ability to work with domain experts customers being very communicative
5901987 its great to ask questions dont waste time tyring to figure something out if your could just get an answer much faster
5901988 make an assumption that you are smarter than your teammates
5901989 it sounds to me like a programmer got thrown into your team that was far far above your teams mediocre abilities and pissed on your parade from a great height and now youre crying
5901990 we discovered we all had a longing to study scripture in a setting that wasnt forced or uncomfortable in a place where we could do normal things like eat laugh put our feet up pray converse we longed for a warm environment to enrich our souls without losing the integrity of the spiritual not perfect just real no pretenses
5901991 through jesus therefore let us continually offer to god a sacrifice of praise the fruit of lips that confess his name
5901992 i had a big big weekend i got married to portia de rossi sorry
5901993 the wedding was everything we hoped it could be i wish i couldve invited all of you but i have some pictures and video i can show you when season 6 starts on september 8 i cant wait to see them too it was all a blur see you then
5901994 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5901995 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5901996 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5901997 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5901998 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5901999 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5902000 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5902001 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5902002 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
5902003 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
5902004 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
5902005 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
5902006 if youre not using bounce rate as a filter to fix things really fast than you are probably committing a crime against humanity
5902007 given the ability of rhodactis sp to rapidly reproduce and completely smother reefs managers are now facing the possibility that even with removal of the ship sheer reproductive capacity of r howesii may continue to fuel its spread along the western reef shelf of palmyra
5902008 but i am not intimidated by that we can have a show that is equally as fantastic without wasting money
5902009 it gave me great pleasure as the final act in my 12 years in state parliament to join with the boards of the two clubs as they finalised their memorandum of understanding for the future amalgamation of the clubs
5902010 i was certainly impressed by the growth plans for the golf club and there should be a few bowlers in the camden haven who should be starting to get pretty excited
5902011 the mou includes the commitment of the laurieton united servicemens club to maintain the golf bowling and social facilities of the camden haven golf club
5902012 the mou also details other important matters including that all members will enjoy dual membership benefits with existing life membership and years of service recognised camden haven golf club sub clubs will remain unchanged all staff currently employed by camden haven golf club will be offered employment by laurieton united servicemens club combining our administration and other similar roles and all assets will be protected under the mou
5902013 the lusc is committed to constructing additional bowling greens on the camden haven golf club premises following the completion of an independent feasibility study along with the relocation of the course maintenance shed and cart sheds
5902014 the camden haven golf club will also keep its name
5902015 its a win win for both clubs the lusc members gain a wonderful asset with a business that will continue to sustain itself bringing greater member benefits and the golf club members gain future security for their club with a view to improvements in the future
5902016 at last election kevin rudd promised to help lower the cost of living and people feel disappointed from one end of the country to another theres a strong opinion of that here in lyne
5902017 people voted for kevin rudd on his appeal to working families and hes not delivered
5902018 the gippsland by election in victoria sent a strong message with a huge swing to the national party
5902019 the eyes of the nation will be on the lyne and mayo south australia by elections if there is a big enough vote for the liberals nationals surely kevin rudd will get the message that he has to rethink his policies
5902020 in the lead up to the next federal election we need to build a strong opposition and this by election is a chance for people to do that
5902021 we want rob drew to continue the good work of mark vaile and to do that you need to be a local member and need to be part of a strong opposition
5902022 there are 150 members in the house of representatives and the two independents are that far out in the wilderness you need binoculars to find them
5902023 they will never have an affect on policy and they will never get into government if youre not in government you cant deliver for the electorate we can offer an alternative government at the next election an independent cant do that
5902024 400 jobs will disappear from a port macquarie call centre if electricity is privatised with many more retail jobs to follow
5902025 this will throw the local economy into an instant recession the people of port macquarie have a very real interest in the electricity privatisation issue but will have no democratic representation in the parliament if this issue is debated before october 18
5902026 we have owned the electricity system for 100 years surely mr iemma can wait another 60 days so the people of port can have a say
5902027 given that no mention of electricity privatisation was heard of during the state election last year the port macquarie by election will most likely be the only opportunity for any people in nsw to pass judgement on the policy
5902028 iemmas only stated reason for electricity privatisation at the alp state conference this year was that without selling off these assets proper investment in other services would be compromised this is nothing more than an admission of incompetence in managing the budget all other governments over the last 100 years have been able to develop public services and infrastructure without selling off electricity
5902029 my second last act as state mp was to sign about 500 letters confirming the herons creek peaking power plant was officially dead
5902030 as my retirement was made official in sydney on wednesday i was driving down the highway to taree to nominate as a federal candidate for lyne and on the way i dropped in at the camden haven golf club
5902031 it gave me great pleasure as the final act in my 12 years in state parliament to join with the boards of the two clubs as they finalised their memorandum of understanding for the future amalgamation of the clubs
5902032 our libraries have more than 25 000 childrens items including books magazines cds and dvds
5902033 last year we issued 120 000 items to children and have 4 300 children under the age of 16 years registered as borrowers if you are not a library member now is the perfect time to join mr maguire said
5902034 at each of our libraries in port macquarie wauchope and laurieton we have planned activities all through childrens book week including afternoon teas and surprise packs and a winter warmers pyjama party
5902035 at council we believe that by encouraging young people to join their local library they will become life long readers which is very important particularly during the school years mr maguire said
5902036 have been major issues for so long and voters blame the republicans and george bush for the problems
5902037 the poll underlines sen barack obamas strengths and weaknesses strengths he leads overall and hes strong with women even stronger among young folks and astronomically strong with blacks weaknesses sen john mccain beats him among white voters men older folks and white catholics
5902038 im trying not to think about the travel im trying to focus on being ready for the game
5902039 the contract is signed now i am just patiently waiting for my work permit
5902040 its vital to get off to a good start ideal world three points but at a minimum you want to get a point out of this game
5902041 in theory we should beat a team like guatemala the reality is is playing in guatemala becomes very difficult and they use all the other factors besides soccer and talent on the field to their advantage so the atmosphere the crowd the travel that we go through the field the temperatures there those can all become excuses for us and benefit to them
5902042 not much jet lag i got to spend a couple days in l a just relaxing
5902043 having this game so close from our last game i think its good because it gets that bitter taste out of our mouths and we can refocus our time and energy to a new cause and thats obviously world cup qualifying
5902044 any time you play in central america play in these type of countries its all going to be hostile
5902045 theyre just trying to get you out of your game
5902046 a lot these countries they get up for these games
5902047 they definitely play a lot better when theyre at home than when theyre on the road
5902048 top companies are already embracing splashtop with asus shipping millions of units and hp introducing splashtop on select notebooks
5902049 as several additional large pc manufacturers are scheduled to begin shipping soon our partnership with nea will enable us to scale up devicevm to meet the worldwide demand for our product
5902050 splashtop is a game changing product in the personal computing space
5902051 we are excited to invest in a revolutionary product and a team like devicevm
5902052 one of the most important and challenging problems it faces is how to address escalating power requirements of large data centers
5902053 our customers are realizing the energy efficiency afforded by a voltaire infiniband fabric and are using the solution as part of their virtualization and consolidation strategies
5902054 more than 70 of global 1000 enterprises will face significant data center problems during the next four years requiring substantial capital costs to build new facilities or refurbish existing ones
5902055 our research has shown that the immediate green it issues in data centers are around power cooling and floor space problems we believe therefore that user spending should focus on these areas
5902056 users should select core it hardware including servers storage and networking equipment based on their energy characteristics as well as on traditional it metrics like price performance
5902057 it virtualization live enables it and business leader professionals to receive an unbiased industry review of the three major virtualization supplier platforms and service alternatives our platform neutrality and independence will assure a balanced educational experience
5902058 showing developers how sr iov can be tested in the platform context to assure robust virtualization based designs is an important step in moving this technology forward
5902059 lecroy s protocol test card has been an extremely helpful tool in demonstrating how the testing could be automated leading to faster and more reliable testing of sr iov features
5902060 we are pleased to have our protocol tools support intel
5902061 said john wiedemeier product marketing manager for pci express lecroy corporation
5902062 developers who need to understand how virtual functions are behaving in a sr iov environment will find these tool interfaces easy to use and highly informative
5902063 where they have burned books they will end in burning human beings
5902064 well be fine once the season starts owens said tuesday
5902065 i mean you can never really get a full or a great assessment just by playing a few plays here a quarter owens said
5902066 once the preseason is over i think its almost like another switch is turned off and another one is turned on said owens who caught a cowboys record 15 td passes last season
5902067 we cant really gauge by how the season may go just by the way the preseason goes
5902068 obviously everybody wants to win the super bowl owens said
5902069 my goal is different my mentality in a sense is i want to win a super bowl but we cant win a super bowl without winning a playoff game so my thinking is lets win a playoff game
5902070 if you go back and watch that game i felt like i could have done more owens said
5902071 i just tried to make the best of the opportunities that were thrown at me owens said
5902072 it was just like when i played in the super bowl with the eagles i told the coach if i am on the field treat me as if i am 100 percent i dont think the cowboys did that at that time
5902073 getting stronger and is ready to get back to practice after being sidelined for three weeks
5902074 its a more detailed agreement on the same principles carr wrote in the e mail
5902075 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
5902076 the way i guess what frontrunner means and the way i think about it is completely different from what theyre using it
5902077 like i said theyre on your side theyre demanding fans everybody knows that when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre not doing good theyre going to let you know we expect better we want better and we want it now and i think they feel that by doing that they can influence the way you play but when youre giving off that negative energy it really doesnt
5902078 people can take it how they want it wasnt a false statement but it wasnt trying to take a cheap shot at anyone either
5902079 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
5902080 the way i guess what frontrunner means and the way i think about it is completely different from what theyre using it
5902081 like i said theyre on your side theyre demanding fans everybody knows that when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre not doing good theyre going to let you know we expect better we want better and we want it now and i think they feel that by doing that they can influence the way you play but when youre giving off that negative energy it really doesnt
5902082 people can take it how they want it wasnt a false statement but it wasnt trying to take a cheap shot at anyone either
5902083 business requirements budget pressures and rapid growth in corporate data volumes are forcing medium size organizations to take a serious look at sophisticated it infrastructure solutions
5902084 previous esg research conducted in 2004 found that more than one third 39 of medium size organizations reported corporate storage requirements of 1 terabyte tb of data or less with just 13 reporting more than 10 tb of data
5902085 survey participants indicate service and support capabilities provided by vendors and or their channel partners are now their number one it infrastructure selection criteria playing a greater role in the purchasing process than price or ongoing operating costs

5902088 necesitamos la movilizaci n social en contra de estos decretos leyes y para eso hacerlo entender como muestra de lo que significa la p rdida del estado de derecho en venezuela
5902089 cualquier intento de regulaci n de constitucionalidad por su parte han dado muestras palpables y suficientes que no son aut nomo ni objetivos ni imparciales y han sido sumisos en convalidar las violaciones de la constituci n por parte de los poderes p blicos pero por sobre todo del presidente de la rep blica

5902091 la reedici n legalizada de la reforma constitucional a la cual democr ticamente le dijimos no el 2 de diciembre

5902097 we didnt see much of a change from q2 to q3
5902098 i grabbed content off free article sites and started posting onto the site for content
5902099 it would be really nice if your suggestion doesnt involve short term and especially long term body modifications like shaving my legs
5902100 if people arent bidding on keywords and are bidding on concepts it could completely change the ball game
5902101 canonical is an important new member for the linux foundation
5902102 we are extremely pleased to work even more closely with canonical as we push linux to the next stage of growth
5902103 oversees development and distribution of the most popular desktop linux distribution
5902104 thats happened to me twice in my career and believe me its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back or wanting to come back to prove someone wrong or wanting to come back from what happened this offseason
5902105 the only reason i came back was i wanted to play its as simple as that
5902106 believe me i wanted to win the game but i give them a tremendous amount of credit and respect
5902107 thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed
5902108 im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league and were just trying to get better this week
5902109 with every preseason game ive played in id like to play the whole game
5902110 if im going to come out here and practice i want to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it and whatever eric wants to do we havent really talked about it
5902111 for the most part its the things that people dont see that weve got to get on board with in a hurry
5902112 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using a term thats already in place or maybe coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things i mean its a work in progress and i think thatll be the case all year long
5902113 in our 2 minute drill today we made some real good plays a lot of signals were given today some things that i had recommended maybe we try
5902114 we kind of just turned it loose today we did good on a couple and didnt do quite as well on the other ones the good thing is that it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections
5902115 i said well theres no substitute for game type situations the 2 minute drills red zone situations third down situations you cant do them all in one day but were trying to throw those in
5902116 well just have to wait and see what tomorrow holds for it so ill wait until the morning
5902117 sometimes they come back very quickly and sometimes they dont sometimes it turns into a deep bleeding thing and were hoping its not that
5902118 you cant buy these but they say they wanna sell em well see i just wanted my own
5902119 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
5902120 if we come again and again with innovation that matters we will have the opportunity to grow our volume and our share
5902121 we made decent progress but we have a ways to go
5902122 we think that tech natural language processing is going to be a very critical way for us to improve relevance further at scale
5902123 these are the domains where we have domain specific task oriented
5902124 cpc is fantastic it will remain but there will be additional things such as cpa
5902125 we think that will bring next level of efficiency to the search marketplace were very bullish about that
5902126 youve got to have the right environment to invite investment in innovation to invite investment in development
5902127 this is my political statement of the day theres really only one country where i dont see this attitude this one the u s
5902128 we dont focus as hard as we should at incentivizing investment and innovation the lapse of the r amp d tax credit is enough of a political statement today where the government refuses to acknowledge that investing in r amp d is important to the future competitiveness of the u s everyone else in the world is recognizing that
5902129 since the wiimote can track sources of infrared ir light you can track pens that have an ir led in the tip by pointing a wiimote at a projection screen or lcd display you can create very low cost interactive whiteboards or tablet displays since the wiimote can track up to four points up to four pens can be used it also works great with rear projected displays
5902130 to be interesting today technology has to be the fastest the best the brightest the lightest but here you can see if you sacrifice a little bit of capability and performance for dramatic savings in cost you can have a pretty dramatic impact
5902131 we need to guard against turning technical and business decisions into political decisions
5902132 for me as a carrier i need to satisfy the voip customer whether its mine or someone elses is irrelevant here by delivering those packets in a timely fashion
5902133 that may mean that for economic reasons within the network to keep the cost reasonable to keep the price reasonable that i need to slow down whats not a time sensitive file
5902134 get all incensed and they accuse me of violating things i didnt even know that i could violate
5902135 doing a p2p download or e mail they arent going to see that 22 millisecond delay and yet thats the kind of thing that seems to cause paranoia
5902136 governments need to make sure they have a very thorough record
5902137 it was such a great phrase that its morphed into more than what it really is
5902138 you have to peel it back and ask what do you really mean

5902217 the society is progressing and people now are more open minded more and more chinese are taking the attitude of enjoying sports
5902218 china is far away from the period when it has to prove its national strength with gold medals chinese will no longer return to the state of east asias sick men just because of the loss of a gold
5902219 the confidence of chinese should not rely on a gold medal but the spirit of struggle

5902233 we have no right therefore to judge cities by their appearances rather than by their actual powers
5902234 most people in fact will not take trouble in finding out the truth but are much more inclined to accep the first story they hear

5902324 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5902325 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5902326 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5902327 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces

5902381 he certainly hasnt either i understand the urgency if it was a regular season game but were treating it as if it was a regular season game i want to see how far he can come in that period of time
5902382 its like a part of your leg it will be a thing he could play out of too most of those guys dont like to be braced at the end of the day
5902383 we really dont hold back anything depending on what quarterback it is
5902384 in fact we had a plan in place where wed play the first team guys through the half and we were talking about the fact that gus needed some snaps with the first team
5902385 i know its easy for me to say after tarvaris gets hurt but frerotte needed some snaps as opposed to having the second team offensive line and the second team wide receivers to throw to so we actually were going to bring him out after the half with the starters in this game perhaps hell get a chance to start well just have to see
5902386 hes had about every test that we know of and the doctors know of
5902387 its just hes uncomfortable with sticking the foot in the ground and breaking straight ahead stuff is ok its not a deal where two weeks rest has made the difference we feel like were treating it right its just a matter of it settling down everybody heals different

5902403 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5902404 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5902405 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5902406 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
5902407 the doctor treated my mother before he treated an israeli soldier lying next to her because her injury was more severe than his the doctors did not see religion political affiliation or nationality they saw only people in need and they helped
5902408 it suddenly dawned on me that the efforts of the israelis were not just isolated individual acts of compassion all this was possible only because the israelis as a state as a society as a culture made a conscious deliberate decision to devote precious resources to saving the lives even of their enemies
5902409 i recalled all the horrible things that i had heard about jews in general and israelis in particular as i was growing up they were greedy brutal and treacherous they were the cause of all misery in the world i had seen with my own eyes that nothing could be further from the truth
5902410 i hate you all i wish you were all dead
5902411 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5902412 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5902413 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5902414 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5902415 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5902416 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5902417 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5902418 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5902419 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5902420 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5902421 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5902422 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5902423 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5902424 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5902425 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5902426 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5902427 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5902428 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5902429 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5902430 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5902431 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5902432 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5902433 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5902434 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5902435 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5902436 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5902437 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5902438 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5902439 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5902440 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5902441 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5902442 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5902443 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5902444 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5902445 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5902446 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5902447 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5902448 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5902449 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5902450 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5902451 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
5902452 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
5902453 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
5902454 its training and leading up to a race for me
5902455 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
5902456 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
5902457 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
5902458 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
5902459 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
5902460 in fact it is stronger than it has ever been so far
5902461 it might not register that its really land at this point
5902462 most of the damage has really been limited to the heavy rainfall
5902463 street flooding downed power lines downed trees that kind of event
5902464 democrats were once patriotic and strong on defense when harry truman and john f kennedy led the party but they have lapsed into weakness and vacillation during the bush era
5902465 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not

5902478 i guess its a stage in my career in my age na alangan talaga e its either you do father role daddy hindi ka na puwedeng magpa cute so its more on accepting mature roles already

5902482 im pretty much content with my career at least im earning
5902483 hindi naman ako pababayaan ng diyos e yon ako e so kung anong gustong isipin ng iba wala na akong magagawa doon
5902484 i mean ang importante sa akin ngayon happy ba ako sa ngayon oo happy ako so its a matter of being content lang kuntento ka lang sa binibigay sayo at kung naishe share mo rin ba yon sa ibang tao
5902485 sinama ko lang siya dahil nag spain kami for sakal sakali saklolo tapos nag extend kami ng paris

5902488 its just a matter of planning everything para hindi tayo napapasubo so medyo na delay lang ng konti pero it wont stop us naman from pursuing everything no one can stop you from marrying the right girl
5902489 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5902490 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5902491 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5902492 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5902493 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5902494 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5902495 predominately its the miners dragging us up and the banks still lagging
5902496 in the last couple of days weve had both the resources and the banks giving us grief but today weve got the resource stocks bouncing quite sharply
5902497 bhp after its good profit got slaughtered yesterday but today after the bounce in commodity prices its up
5902498 you also have different start times all over the state
5902499 some of it might be that language barrier knowing when its time to come back
5902500 then all of a sudden here comes all these kids and lo and behold you need those teachers right back where they were
5902501 its better if parents start them not only for their kids sake but for the school as a whole
5902502 it would be really nice if your suggestion doesnt involve short term and especially long term body modifications like shaving my legs
5902503 when the shelling started the georgian troops would wait until the south ossetians would retreat to their basements as they have done for years during similar attacks and then the georgian army regulars would throw grenades into the basements of the houses or open fire on the civilians crowded inside their tiny basements
5902504 this is the biggest crisis yellowstone faces since it was created at the current rate of permanent habitat loss the extraordinary wildlife that characterizes the region will not be maintained for future generations
5902505 very few of the millions visiting have any sense of that
5902506 our generation faces a historic challenge and opportunity to secure yellowstones wildlife heritage for all time if we fail the park and iconic assemblage of wildlife species that give this landscape its life will be diminished forever
5902507 the olympic games serve as an apt metaphor and occur at an appropriate time to remind the nations educators and parents that we need to acknowledge this widespread problem and work harder to engage boys in reading
5902508 boys have trouble reading because they dont get to read for a purpose that makes any sense to them
5902509 as a society we need to make more of an effort to connect boys with many different kinds of reading both at home and at school
5902510 if we can expand the notion of what reading is well have a better chance of inspiring boys to want to be readers this means broadening our definition of reading to include boy friendly nonfiction humor sports comics graphic novels action adventure magazines websites and newspapers boys need to know that these materials count as reading
5902511 we can help boys become readers by giving them a reason to want to become readers
5902512 this approach opens the door and the mind once a boy starts reading he will be more receptive to many other types of reading over his lifetime
5902513 the stinky cheese man which won the caldecott honor medal
5902514 a lot of times i didnt even think of using my cellphone to make calls out of the country
5902515 now i dont hesitate if i want to call from my cellphone its no different from any other local call
5902516 i know but how can i complain its a job
5902517 when i first read the script i was at the edge of my seat while reading it and i finished it in one seating i love my character here so i asked my bosses if i can do this one
5902518 the script is that good i want to do this talaga
5902519 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5902520 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5902521 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5902522 happy po ako nang tawagan ako ng production para mag audition thirty minutes yon na test of my ratio bilang isang artista medyo kinabahan po ako kasi hindi ako prepared sa mga questions na itatanong sa akin pero nakapasa naman po at nag workshop kami for ten days kaya sa actual taping hindi na rin naging mahirap sa amin at kay direk laurice guillen maganda rin na dahil sa workshop nagkaroon kami ng bonding ng buong cast at masaya kami tuwing taping days namin

5902531 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5902532 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5902533 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5902534 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5902535 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5902536 id rather vote for the devil i know than the devil i dont know
5902537 we have sent you o muhammad as a mercy for all the nations
5902538 we always were under a very firm belief that we would get this together such a firm belief that much to the shock of the investment bank we were working with we as the founders put up our own money into making it happen and anyone in business will tell you that spending your own cash is a terrible idea in fact when we did eventually have to lay almost everybody off the last paycheck we paid out all came out of the board of directors pockets because we had anticipated having a deal done by that time i had to basically liquidate 401 k s to pay peoples salaries
5902539 the subscription money we did get we all poured directly into keeping the game online keeping it up and running but the development demands far outstripped the revenues there wasnt really enough revenues coming in to cover the expected and required development costs
5902540 we worked with hanbitsoft for a long time back in the blizzard days we launched starcraft and diablo with them together both companies had a huge amount of success when we started flagship studios there really wasnt any doubt we wanted to work with hanbit that was our known comfortable go to company because id known them for a long time and had a very good relationship with them the real challenges started when t3 came in as an investor and pretty much everything changed overnight
5902541 they havent taken that final step actually but that is where its at we dont have the money to pay back the loan
5902542 its basically held by the bank if flagship could come up with the money to pay back the loan its ours again but we dont have that money weve been working with comerica to provide them with anything and everything theyve requested to be able to properly represent the ip represent whats being held in escrow and working with them to try to identify people that might be interested in that comerica holds the ip code tech and tools so to be honest if i personally had the money id buy it back out the technology and the toolset that we built is a really powerful platform for creating titles that was really the goal of what we were going to be doing at flagship we were going to be using the tech and tools using the platform and creating games based off of that as our core moving forward
5902543 i know none of the principals or the directors have any interest in working with them i know the mythos team doesnt want to work on that i think theyd love to be able to work on mythos but they pretty specifically wouldnt want to work for t3 they have it but its not done and they dont have any of the engineers that were there that know how to build the game or use the tools or use the tech or anything
5902544 eas been incredibly supportive with that as well theyve hired some of our guys as did namco so they can continue to keep the operations going
5902545 this case has been a rollercoaster ride since the beginning the california pharmacists association applauds judge snyder for recognizing the damage that the cuts were having on pharmacy and the patients they serve

5902547 we hope that fans of the worlds most popular board game will enjoy buying selling and trading real estate from around the globe in the new monopoly game that they created with their votes
5902548 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet

5902557 obamas favorable rating has sunk to 48 from 59 since the last times bloomberg poll in june at the same time his negative rating has risen to 35 from 27 by comparison mccains ratings have hardly budged during the same period 46 of voters have a positive feeling about him 38 give him negative ratings
5902558 nine out of 10 republicans favor mccain while just under 8 in 10 democrats support obama
5902559 multinationals from around the world have shown us how difficult it is to get complete foreign exchange exposure data out of their erp systems and how inaccurate their exposure calculations can be from the data they do get

5902561 well the best thing my mother has told me is watch out for fast women
5902562 she told me that long ago said they often turn out to be women you basically would not want in the long run but wow fast women sure are fun
5902563 divorce wasnt common in those days and my mom changed after that she told me to never settle ever she said that while she was raised at a time where women werent free to do a lot of dating and getting to know different men that she didnt want any of her daughters to be caught in that stale pool she told me to respect myself never let anyone including men disrespect me but to enjoy myself and enjoy life
5902564 mom advised that i should get to know me first and what i liked disliked because i could never express to someone else what was right or wrong with the way our relationship was if i didnt know what it took for me to be happy and satisfied
5902565 look 80 percent of the things my mother says i dont agree with maybe it s because she s a woman but when it comes to relationships she is the judge jury and executioner bring yo gurl or potential gurl around and ill be damned if mom doesnt expose her for the princess she is or the tramp she is within 30 seconds flat the point im tryin to make is that parents know the game because they seen it all a father will read yo man like a book and a mother will give you the 411 on the so called woman of yo dreams you might not want to hear it but hey that s how it is
5902566 my mom didnt specifically give me any advice on love im more so a product of my father s training
5902567 when i was about 9 or 10 i remembered my dad telling me that when i grew up i mustnt allow any man to treat me badly and i havent so far my father also always allowed me to have the best of anything he had to give or share with me for example if he had some fruits and i wanted any he would pick out the best looking ones or pieces and offer them to me and keep the lesser ones for himself for better or worst i think i grew up to subconsciously use that standard to judge any man i become involved with if i dont see believe that they consistently take the initiative to always offer me the best then i know that their time is limited because i wont really trust their alleged love for me
5902568 from my mother i heard dont use me as an example in love i make horrible choices and have suffered in love she is very very correct in that statement though im an accomplished person in my professional life sadly i modeled a lot of my dating behavior after her and make horrible choices in men too
5902569 from my mother i learned a man will treat you as well as you insist and as badly as you allow and from my father everyone you meet can teach you something even if it s only whom to avoid
5902570 to admire glenn gould or indeed alfred brendel or maurizio pollini two other pianists whom said singles out is not unusual and it could perhaps be claimed that saids views tend to be rather establishment ones he writes a wholly adulatory article about boulez for example without any mention of boulezs jesuitical dogmaticism or his musical narrow mindedness similarly said seems too respectful of adorno he makes good use of some of adornos more insightful observations but also quotes a number of his tiresomely prejudicial opinions about composers he disapproved of without criticism but as with boulez it is always stimulating to disagree with said and reading the last essay in this book appropriately about late beethoven which said felt to be more about the opening up of new horizons than reaching conclusions makes one sadly aware of just what a loss his premature death has been
5902571 clearly a great number of patriotic and deeply concerned citizens of palm beach county fear that they may have unwittingly cast their vote for someone other than their candidate
5902572 it was the clear and unambiguous intention of the framers of the constitution of the united states that presidential elections be held on a single day throughout the united states

5902579 in little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries at prices that are going through the roof this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation
5902580 they made leaving and coming back as easy as possible
5902581 many of these people just need some assistance and understanding on our part so that they can move back into normal physical and mental capabilities and work safely
5902582 we need everyone to feel confident in everyone elses abilities to focus on their tasks and be safe
5902583 its something that the employees show a lot of pride in
5902584 we have a lot of investment in employees who get deployed and we would love to see them come back and be able to utilize that training once again and also bring back great training that they get while deployed
5902585 we feel we get a lot back out of this its not a one way street at all
5902586 weve had a lot of great partnerships with the military and keep trying to nurture those its one of those where we keep working on the relationship and it keeps paying off and thats a great partnership when you have both sides supporting each other
5902587 we feel like were the beneficiary more so than the contributor here
5902588 this verus is taking about how they had fallen away from there first love the enthusiasm as a new christian with little knowledge of him had been replace with knowlege and little or no enthusiasm
5902589 go back to what you heard and believed at first hold to it firmly repent and turn to me again if you dont wake up i will come to you suddenly as unexpected as a thief
5902590 for it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the holy spirit 5 who have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the power of the age to come 6 and who then turn away from god it is impossible to bring such people back to repentance by rejecting the son of god they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame
5902591 people who conceal their sins will not prosper but if they confess and turn from them they will receive mercy
5902592 no and i tell you again that unless you repent you will perish too
5902593 you were sorry and humbled yourself before the lord when you heard what i said against this city and its people that this land would be cursed and become desolate you tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance and i have indeed heard you says the lord
5902594 then hezekiah humbled himself and repented of his pride as did the people of jerusalem so the lords anger did not fall on them during hezekiahs lifetime
5902595 i take back everything i said and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance
5902596 repent all of you who forget me or i will tear you apart and no one will help you
5902597 zion will be restored by justice those who repent will be revived by righteousness
5902598 if you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning they will die in their sins but you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me
5902599 gather before judgment begins before your time to repent is blown away like chaff act now before the fierce fury of the lord fallsand the terrible day of the lords anger begins
5902600 repent of your sins and turn to god for the kingdom of heaven is near
5902601 prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to god
5902602 so the disciples went out telling everyone they met to repent of their sins and turn to god
5902603 in the same way there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to god than over ninety nine others who are righteous and havent strayed away
5902604 last night i stayed up late playing poker with tarot cards i got a full house and four people died

5902616 the industry indicated that these guidelines actually suited their needs because what they want to prove is a couple of successful opportunities and then hope that one of those investors is able to take it to a commercial demonstration plant which then will encourage the private sector to further invest in the industry
5902617 the geothermal industry is regarded as very important from a renewable point of view because what youre effectively doing is pumping water below ground where its heated by hot rocks and circulated through a closed system that generates electricity which is entirely different in terms of emissions from a coal fired power station
5902618 if you could produce the geothermal energy and use it to supply local loads the cost could be comparable to coal
5902619 if on the other hand youre talking about getting hot rock energy coming into electricity in central australia and then building large transmission lines to adelaide and sydney the costs are going to be too expensive
5902620 in theory these fields only last a limited amount of time and then the heat runs out and theyve got to move onto another field
5902621 then it takes about 100 years for the heat to come back to the first field
5902622 its often claimed these are renewable energy projects but 100 years renewable is not a renewable industry in my book
5902623 we hope that north korea gives us concrete results by the fall

5902800 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me

5902820 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

5902925 id love to play the whole game thats just my mentality will that happen no were going to be smart about it whatever coach eric mangini wants to do we havent really talked about it
5902926 we made some real good plays we kind of just turned it loose we did good on a couple and didnt do quite as well on the other ones the good thing is that it was practice we can go back and look at it on film and make the corrections
5902927 right now hes ahead of schedule hes getting more comfortable with the plays along with the players as long as hes comfortable out there he should be able to play fine
5902928 it never really crossed my mind living that close i just always thought that plainfield was a safe community and i always felt safe here
5902929 they will be asked to put in a zip code and they can put in as many facilities as they want to get the notification when something occurs
5902930 i think any type of notification would be good certainly
5902931 i think its good to just be informed about what is going on around you i would want to know if someone broke out so i could take extra precautions
5902932 in germany they first came for the communists and i didnt speak up because i wasnt a communist
5902933 everybody is so proud of that the olympics because we dreamed it for 100 years and now we just got it
5902934 from the time of the opening ceremony the organizing the competition and the competitors everything has been great great
5902935 the whole atmosphere here its really different than from europe and the u s a united states
5902936 its really hard to say in words but you feel it that its a different culture different people different mentality
5902937 the olympics are very great because there come they bring together a lot of cultures together and a lot of nations
5902938 the food is very interesting here its different from german food all people eat from the same plate
5902939 and the animals meat for example we ate a frog in germany you would never eat a frog
5902940 its almost like they feel entitled or its a right or a right of passage maybe its all those things but there is that correlation and weve created that in our culture
5902941 people are going to break the law anyway might as well change the law to 18 in my opinion
5902942 i understand their need to do something i really do i know what goes on and i worry about those kids but im not so sure thats the right path
5902943 there is a preponderance of reliable research that says twice as many people who begin alcohol usage at 18 will develop alcoholism as compared to people who begin usage at 21 twice as many
5902944 that could be a problem because i dont think high schoolers should be drinking i could see where people are coming from if theyre old enough to do all that stuff then why cant they drink
5902945 no lupe or nerd its just kanye its still go
5902946 any idea if hell be bringing lupe amp n e r
5902947 i think its just sad that the govt is actually
5902948 as i understand it it was a complex attack involving multiple weapons systems small arms mortars rockets and it lasted for several hours
5902949 im not ready to declare any sort of new insurgent strategy
5902950 the attacks do symbolize the importance of the u s coalition mission in afghanistan
5902951 i think its a reflection of the fact that this is an enemy that needs to be taken on
5902952 this is a difficult time right now for the families and friends of those who died or were injured and we offer them our sincere condolences and sympathies
5902953 the lives of these soldiers are irreplaceable but this loss does not deter isaf from supporting the people of afghanistan in their fight against the enemies of peace and stability
5902954 this is another example of the enemies of afghanistans complete disregard for the people of afghanistan and the rule of law
5902955 i strongly condemn this callous and heartless attack on the people of afghanistan on this highly significant day of celebration
5902956 my resolve and that of the international community remain unwavering in our efforts to support the government of afghanistan and the people of afghanistan in bringing peace and security to their nation
5902957 es una obligaci n ganar ma ana y m s en el azteca simplemente por tener tantos jugadores en el extranjero y naturalizados es un plantel que por primer vez podemos contar con demasiado talento y una experiencia increible
5902958 no pensamos en una derrota pero en caso de sufrirla la primera cr tica ser a de uno mismo creo que si no tenemos autocr tica no podemos estar en este negocio as que si perdemos me tendr que reprochar a m mismo ya que para este juego contamos con el apoyo incondicional de todos los equipos al prestarnos a todos los jugadores
5902959 apl was acquired by a foreign company as a company that atthe time had a 150 year history and has many of the sameemotions and concerns on the part of the people that worked forapl in terms of being acquired by a foreign company
5902960 the fact is if apl had not been acquired by nol it wouldnot exist today
5902961 im a personal example of how you can put two companiestogether and take advantage of the strength of what is insidethose organisations
5902962 the market should open lower following the overseas weaknessbut it could stablise if losses in asia pacific markets narrow

5902976 nunca doy la formaci n antes del juego es como darle una peque a ayuda al adversario en todas las formaciones siempre hay discusiones de si este u otro jugador es mejor que se den despu s del juego y no antes me va a dar mucho gusto ver los peri dicos de ma ana para ver las alineaciones que ponen
5902977 muchos de los temas de procedimiento necesarios para que esta repetici n instant nea pueda ser adoptada necesitan ser trabajados
5902978 las grandes ligas necesitan ir al plato y resolver estos temas
5902979 no voy a resolver todos estos temas uno por uno les dir que en varios de ellos los comentarios simplemente no son los adecuados
5902980 por ejemplo tenemos un entendimiento desde hace alg n tiempo con el sindicato de umpires en el sentido de que s lo el jefe del grupo de rbitros ser a el nico responsable para revisar el v deo y tomar las decisiones en torno a las repeticiones instant neas

5902982 we had a good practice today with the guys really bouncing around out there
5902983 it was great to see because you never know how they will respond after you give them a day off
5902984 ive been proud of how they are competing and hanging onto the ball i think that all three of them have a role but right now its hard to say that one is ahead of the others at this point
5902985 he was physical and really tried to dominate his guy today he has really gotten stronger and weve seen him giving really good effort and trying to get better at his position and his craft he has all the tools we want him to just keep being physical
5902986 reid cant go for the whole practice but we have him working with the first group when he can go through some run polish and work on some mental things
5902987 but hes not completely well enough to get in there and mix it up yet
5902988 chris was back for the first time in a while
5902989 it was good to see him out there he is starting to come back and thats great weve been missing him hes played the position and got some natural instincts there at defensive end

5903032 none the europeans have an advantage over us in almost every aspect mainly because they have more competitive experience than the americans
5903033 but if there is anything on our side its that we are playing on our home soil of course that hasnt stopped the germans the past two years but they will have more pressure of expectation so at least the usa players can have the cushion of being the underdogs

5903099 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5903100 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population

5903214 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand v 2 by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain v 3 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures v 4 and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures v 5 and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve v 6 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep v 7 after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles v 8 and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time v 9 for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god v 10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me v 11 therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed v 12 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead v 13 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen v 14 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain v 15 yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not v 16 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised v 17 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins v 18 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished v 19 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are all men most miserable

5903233 it will speed development of solid state drive ssd technology and drop the cost smaller pc manufacturers will be able to buy pre integrated ssd drives that will seamlessly slide right into current laptop and desktop designs which means no additional redesign or development cost
5903234 on the plus side they are faster smaller and can take less power they arent mechanical and are thus more reliable than regular hard drives
5903235 the downside is that currently they are more expensive over time the price of ssds will come down but i believe most users will eventually have systems that utilize both ssds and traditional hard drives a decent sized ssd will give a speed boost while the regular hard drive will store the bulk of the data

5903284 our constitution provides for equality which includes special help and care for the oppressed and weaker sections who have been historically downtrodden the sc st communities in our opinion are also equal citizens and are entitled to a life of dignity in view of article 21 of the constitution as interpreted by this court
5903285 in the age of democracy no people and no community should be treated as being inferior however the truth is that in many parts of our country persons belonging to the sc st are oppressed humiliated and insulted this is a disgrace to our country
5903286 the caste system is a curse on our nation and the sooner it is destroyed the better in fact it is dividing our country at a time when we must all be united as indians if we wish to face the gigantic problems confronting us poverty unemployment price rise corruption etc the 1989 act is a salutary legislative measure in that direction
5903287 in this connection it may be mentioned that in america to use the word nigger today for an african american is regarded as highly offensive and is totally unacceptable even if it was acceptable 50 years ago
5903288 in our opinion calling a member of the scheduled caste chamar with intent to insult or humiliate him in a place within public view is certainly an offence under section 3 1 x of the act whether there was intent to insult or humiliate a person by using the word chamar will of course depend on the context in which it was used
5903289 in a country like ours with so much diversity so many religions castes ethnic and lingual groups etc all communities and groups must be treated with respect and no one should be looked down upon as inferior that is the only way we can keep our country united

5903312 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another

5903405 we have sleeping beauties inside of us that are waiting to be recognized so that we may awaken to the truth of our existence and connection with all things

5903429 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field

5903579 no diety in any religion is better than the average person
5903580 hes a guy who had command of both sides of the plate and command of the strike zone
5903581 as i have said if you can make pitches low in the strike zone you can pitch anywhere and he did that and could pitch in the big leagues
5903582 i am doing good and feeling good and my arm is in good shape
5903583 it was my second tommy john surgery so you have to be patient my velocity is there 90 91 89 when i signed with the yankees it was to prove that i am healthy and to get an opportunity to pitch
5903584 it doesnt seem to make sense that you would include in the tax hybrid vehicles and green vehicles that are ultra fuel efficient he told abc radio today
5903585 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5903586 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5903587 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5903588 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5903589 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5903590 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5903591 weve got to work with the business sector to try and get carbon capture and storage in place because 80 per cent of our electricity in australia at the moment is currently by coal fired power stations he said
5903592 the more i think about it the more i realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others
5903593 the aim of every artist is to arrest motion which is life by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later when a stranger looks at it it moves again since it is life
5903594 it is art that makes life makes interest makes importance and i know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process
5903595 art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end
5903596 i see little of more importance to the future of our country and of civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist if art is to nourish the roots of our culture society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him
5903597 there is nothing more difficult for a truly creative painter than to paint a rose because before he can do so he has first to forget all the roses that were ever painted
5903598 if i didnt start painting i would have raised chickens
5903599 often while reading a book one feels that the author would have preferred to paint rather than write one can sense the pleasure he derives from describing a landscape or a person as if he were painting what he is saying because deep in his heart he would have preferred to use brushes and colors
5903600 a nonscientific branch of learning one of the liberal arts
5903601 a system of principles and methods employed in the performance of a set of activities the art of building a trade or craft that applies such a system of principles and methods the art of the lexicographer
5903602 art is a selective re creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value judgments an artist recreates those aspects of reality which represent his fundamental view of mans nature
5903603 there has to be one how did anyone teach this class
5903604 i choose a block of marble and chop off whatever i dont need
5903605 inside you theres an artist you dont know about hes not interested in how things look different in moonlight
5903606 not even the visionary or mystical experience ever lasts very long it is for art to capture that experience to offer it to in the case of literature its readers to be for a secular materialist culture some sort of replacement for what the love of god offers in the world of faith
5903607 great art is never produced for its own sake it is too difficult to be worth the effort
5903608 what distinguishes a great artist from a weak one is first their sensibility and tenderness second their imagination and third their industry
5903609 lady georgiana spencer was born on june 7th 1757 her father john spencer 1st earl spencer was a great grandson of john churchill 1st duke of marlborough her niece was lady caroline lamb among her descendants is the present duke of devonshire via her granddaughter another was diana princess of wales born lady diana spencer who was descended from georgianas brother the 2nd earl spencer georgiana married william cavendish on june 6 1774 they has a son william george spencer cavendish who became the 6th duke of devonshire and 2 daughters georgiana and harriet

5903612 when she appeared every eye was turned towards her when absent she was the subject of universal conversation
5903613 t he idea of fairness is at the heart of his whole economic argument and he goes back to it in almost every public appearance
5903614 it is time for folks like me who make more than 250 000 to pay our fair share
5903615 w e will save social security for future generations by asking the wealthiest americans to pay their fair share
5903616 the first part of my plan is to tax the windfall profits of oil companies and use some of that money to help you pay the rising price of gas
5903617 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness

5903620 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5903621 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5903622 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5903623 we are delighted that the british public has voted enid blyton its best loved author

5903628 new zealands exporters are being hit by a double whammy with high oil prices and inflationary pressures having a direct impact while the deteriorating economic conditions of key trading partners are indirectly impacting exporting volumes and revenue
5903629 in an environment of higher oil prices lower consumer spending and tighter lending standards the global inflation challenge is forcing exporters to choose between raising prices and risking customer backlash or absorbing the additional costs their business is facing
5903630 i am not only representing myself i have a responsibility to fight for my country
5903631 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down li said
5903632 it shows the dream of chinese sportsmen for generations and also the common aspirations of 1 3 billion chinese people
5903633 otaku the nickname given to the chinese couch potatoes glued to olympic tv coverage
5903634 more and more young people are participating in olympic sports said dr
5903635 and were seeing people crowd around big screen tvs to watch the events theyre more interested in sports than in cultural programs
5903636 this is the culmination of a 100 year dream to have an olympic games in china the olympics have had a feel good effect on chinese society which they probably will elect to keep up
5903637 with the sports infrastructure the facilities the coaches who are being developed here and the young people who will be inspired by these games we think this will be a formidable system that well have to contend with for a very very long time said jim scherr head of the u
5903638 in shooting we call it the home venue curse said wang yifu coach of chinas shooting team
5903639 mother tongue interference and home venue pressure are the biggest obstacles
5903640 there is so much psychological pressure on them that i thought more athletes might collapse she said
5903641 i have a responsibility to fight for my country i was fighting for chinas glory
5903642 ive been thinking about it and i dont think it will help the
5903643 even touch wood with a gold medal i dont think it would help the game that immensely theres still a lot of things to work out and having teams coming in and out of the league theres no stability there
5903644 the fans are going to get fed up with it and i think thats whats happened
5903645 the nbls got a lot of work to do to get to the next level
5903646 i think off the floor there was a problem whereas on the floor theres some great talent the competition is there
5903647 but off the floor the marketing and those types of things need to get in order
5903648 its a very important time for our game in our country its taken some shots and a win wakes the whole country up
5903649 its like the socceroos in the world cup or the when wallabies play the all blacks
5903650 theres a lot of interest and right now our game needs the boomers to gain respect
5903651 subscribers in brazil russia and later this year china are migrating to 3g which in turn will lead to a 2g and 2 5g to 3g subscriber migration process in 2008 however current gsm deployment patterns remain unabated with double digit gsm subscriber growth rates being common in bric countries
5903652 di permatang pauh ini sendiri sebenarnya mereka fitnah kononnya pas tidak membantu kempen sedangkan kalau tengok jentera bantuan ketara sekali dan kerjasama pas cukup baik
5903653 dalam satu majlis baru baru ini ramai pemimpin pas datang saya katakan kepada pemimpin umno bahawa inilah sokongan yang pas berikan tetapi ini tak dilaporkan oleh media arus perdana
5903654 seperti juga pas di pulau pinang yang tidak puas hati kepada kerajaan negeri ini soal biasa yang bukan isu besar yang boleh sebabkan ketegangan namun ini dilaporkan oleh media arus perdana untuk mencetus kemelut kononnya
5903655 isu ini sebenarnya isu yang boleh dirundingkan dan pandangan mereka yang tidak berpuashati itu hanyalah sekadar pandangan mereka dan ini bukanlah mewakili parti secara keseluruhannya
5903656 kalau tengok nik aziz telah memberi penegasan terhadap sokongan kepada pakatan rakyat di sini dan datang pada hari penamaan calon
5903657 selain itu kalau dengar doa oleh ketua dewan ulama ustaz mohd daud iraqi dia berdoa sangat kuat supaya kerjasama dalam pakatan semakin kuat ini satu signal yang jelas bagi saya cara mereka hormati kami dalam muktamar cukup baik tetapi media tak perbesarkan
5903658 since she has given us another day to finish our assignments i feel like im back in college
5903659 but my sales people are already busy enough as it is this is complete head trash and a blog for another day but lets appease this disillusioned sales manager for now how could they possibly squeeze more activities into their day
5903660 but didnt we try this a couple of years ago and very few of the appointments turned into actual closed deals
5903661 yeah but these guys offer a 100 satisfaction guarantee if they dont produce well just fireem
5903662 we made a land where crap is king and the good dont last too long
5903663 do you have the tools necessary to do your job
5903664 it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of financial disclosure
5903665 in texas we have a long tradition of not talking about the number of cattle you own or your net worth
5903666 a blind trust businesswise is not very different from this grantor trust but youre taxed on passive income versus income
5903667 identification of each trust asset if known to the beneficiary from which income was received by the beneficiary in excess of 500
5903668 in my interpretation of the law you only have two choices you either disclose your assets if its in a regular trust or you have a blind trust
5903669 as it turns out he comes into our life and we actually fall in love with him and we get a second one and its been far greater than wed anticipated
5903670 so many schools are full and they just dont have room for all these students
5903671 i think it would be the second part of saying goodbye like saying it to my family in germany
5903672 the lesson i want to give them and what we taught our kids is never to give up and endure whatever obstacles are placed in front of you
5903673 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5903674 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5903675 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
5903676 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5903677 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5903678 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5903679 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5903680 but an election with three great characters if youre a writer peering beyond the ideological agenda involved the imagination almost cant grasp its good fortune this year the three are the stuff of pulp archetypes out of an allen drury novel they include the flinty aging onetime prisoner of war uneasily navigating the demands of expediency the charismatic young african american street organizer raised by a teenage mother from kansas and deserted by a father from kenya and finally of course the former first lady turned senator steely intrepid her career deferred all those years for the sake of the faithless rhodes scholar elvis can you make this up well yes but its not as good
5903681 we got three days notices that we havent paid our rent and i showed up with copies of it and they still say that you didnt get to pay your rent
5903682 for many for these years i have suffered from cardio problems and i just learned i have inoperable cancer and it kind of upset me because they wanted to evict me and i am getting tired of it
5903683 because this is what they are doing take it up with the old management
5903684 this place had been mismanaged and now they have a professional management company take over
5903685 what are we supposed to do just let it go if the rent wasnt paid well that isnt going to happen
5903686 weve tried this morning to lure the whale out this morning but it has failed

5903688 yes i am a frustrated malaysian i am frustrated because in malaysia our consumer rights and protections sucks
5903689 most people miss the edges of their face so starting there will help make sure every part is covered
5903690 have all the friends i have known better to feel so alone
5903691 this is good news for the hosting industry and i only hope that other states and the federal government will follow suit
5903692 ytb and other card mills have been preying on unsuspecting consumers for too long for those who really want to develop a travel business and actively sell travel path provides agents with a means of locating reputable legitimate host agencies which are not involved with
5903693 uhhm hey can i add that friend to our call
5903694 oh wait so i can tlk to you without that bitch in the conversation

5903700 despite the lies that youre making your love is mine for the taking my love is just waiting to turn your tears to roses

5903703 well i love you if you love me youll do it
5903704 she just had the baby this morning it had big blue eyes and red hair
5903705 how did we overcome such obsticals and set backs they told me i was average but i just couldnt accept that let that be the words carved in my headstone p s you hatin motherf kers were dead wrong
5903706 and the worse thing is she is not even pretty
5903707 how did we overcome such obsticals and set backs they told me i was average but i just couldnt accept that let that be the words carved in my headstone p s you hatin motherf kers were dead wrong
5903708 this world has been connected tied to the darkness soon to be completely eclipsed
5903709 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair
5903710 how did we overcome such obsticals and set backs they told me i was average but i just couldnt accept that let that be the words carved in my headstone p s you hatin motherf kers were dead wrong
5903711 18 nannte erinnere ich mich noch einigerma en gut weil ich es damals eine zeit lang tats chlich mit ein paar freunden gelegentlich gespielt hatte man w rfelte die achtzehn w rfel auf einem gro en schachbrett jaja das gro e schachbrett neben w rfeln und karten das hauptutensil meiner damaligen spiele und ordnete sie in senkrechten reihen nach ihrer augenzahl an von oben nach unten rechts mit der 1 beginnend
5903712 18 war kein schlechtes spiel jedenfalls gewiss nicht schlechter als viele spiele die ich damals in kleinen taschenb chern mit spielesammlungen fand die voll mit simplen fantasielosen und unspannenden spieleideen waren um ihre seiten zu f llen aber auch kein wirklich gutes spiel auch wenn die idee als solches potenzial hat und ich sie im hinterkopf behalte um vielleicht irgendwann davon ausgehend ein besseres spiel zu entwickeln
5903713 but you said you were done i need in there
5903714 but my books in there then to her how long are you going to be pause the doors locked cant you give me my book you said you were done
5903715 first of all she came out of the bathroom and said she was done so i went in put my book down had to go out real quick and while i was out she snuck back in and locked the door
5903716 when she said she was done did she realize she was signing a contract in blood not to return to the bathroom within x number of minutes or was she under the impression that it was just a passing comment
5903717 well it should go without saying when you say youre done youre done
5903718 it was laying right there how could she not see it
5903719 yeah but you leave it laying around quite a bit did she know this was a fresh deposit of the book
5903720 well i have another question after she went back in and locked you out was she attending to legitimate bathroom business or was she tapping her fingers and laughing diabolically
5903721 when youre fighting for clicks on youtube you find that subtlety is what closes on saturday night you have become a programmer not an advertiser so funny becomes hilarious and interesting becomes fascinating
5903722 last to first its pretty cool one off day and i make up 16 games so im excited
5903723 you never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that but its nice to be back in a pennant race
5903724 it was fun playing in san diego and i loved it there but im looking forward to the last month and a half here it was great last time i was here it was fun and it was exciting i had a lot of good memories then and i look forward to making some new ones first day of spring training all over again i just want to learn my teammates and do what i can to be accepted get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them hopefully well get to the postseason and find out if its a better team than two years ago its how you do in october that determines how good the team is
5903725 i mean the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four i dont know what their reasons are i didnt ask and i didnt care im just glad to be here and im glad they gave me a day to pitch which is friday
5903726 well put him in friday hell be pitching every five days from there
5903727 his experience is his hole card youre going to have to find a way to beat him because he wont beat himself he has the ability to keep you in a game he knows what hes doing to me he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days
5903728 great the guys got a lot to offer a hall of famer
5903729 hes a lot smarter than a lot of people smarter than anyone ive ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned
5903730 the thing about greg he keeps everything so simple people like to make things more complicated than they need to be you learn a lot the way he approaches the game
5903731 weve had people in the ballpark his last three starts
5903732 hes pitched very well hes got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there he know how to pitch he knows how to attack a hitter
5903733 as a market watcher i though that statistic was interesting to put up there
5903734 in the intel forecast they have desktop shipments growing through 2012 and it shows that there still is a nugget there for intel even though the desktop pc market has slowed in the u s and in western europe there is still enough growth in the desktop market to carry a load for intel
5903735 a new zealand court has allowed a parade of topless porn stars on motor bikes to proceed on the main street of the countrys biggest city local media said tuesday
5903736 obama has chosen caroline kennedy to be his running mate in a bid to include a woman who is not hillary clinton kennedy is the only woman democrats would accept who is not hillary
5903737 i have an incomplete album that i want to finish i have been thinking about the plan during my days in jail i have sung rock n roll for 40 years after jail i will rock n roll
5903738 the last information we have is that shortly before the flight to the uk departed he declined to board
5903739 we were last aware that he remained in transit he decides where he applies to go and the country or authorities there will decide whether they permit him to enter their territory
5903740 its all fun and games til someone comes out of here with a patchy haircut
5903741 youre talking about finding a way to protect a lineup or enhance a lineup theres an anchor
5903742 theres a cleanup hitter right in the middle of your lineup he adds a dimension that they didnt have before him they had a cleanup hitter and had a pretty good one but this fortifies it
5903743 he keeps the barrel through the zone a very long time from back to front that is why you see the high hand finish
5903744 more often than not good hitters they get through the zone they stay in the zone a long time they finish high and theyre facing the dead middle of the field
5903745 if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5903746 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5903747 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5903748 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5903749 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5903750 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
5903751 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
5903752 the hurdles were just coming up too fast and i lost control
5903753 its like driving a race car you go into a curve and you either maintain control or you crash and burn today i crashed and burned
5903754 i dont want to tell you what im feeling right now
5903755 all i know is that when he went in there people couldnt tackle him said saints quarterback
5903756 mike was a bruiser but hes going to give more punishment than he takes i knew at some point he was going to get an opportunity to be a no 1 back in this league
5903757 no one really knew he had that top end speed even though we had all heard of michael the burner turner brees said
5903758 it was like one of those moments where you go oh man where did that come from
5903759 sp3 install crashed and failed to install your computer may not boot
5903760 the love for justice that is in us is not only the best part of our being it is also the most true to our nature
5903761 of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive it may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies the robber barons cruelty may sometimes sleep his cupidity may at some point be satiated but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience
5903762 freedom is not simply the right of intellectuals to circulate their merchandise
5903763 you can safely assume youve created god in your own image when it turns out that god hates all the same people you do
5903764 if the spirit is at peace though the body contend there is no violence but if the spirit is not at peace though the body be at rest there is always violence
5903765 i am a republican a black dyed in the wool republican and i never intend to belong to any other party than the party of freedom and progress
5903766 it isnt that liberals are ignorant its just that they know so much that isnt so
5903767 the urge to save humanity is almost always a false front for the urge to rule
5903768 the right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously
5903769 a liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel
5903770 the only truly consistent man is he who will for the sake of being right today contradict what he said wrong yesterday
5903771 im having a lot of anxiety and that worries me
5903772 man is not disappointed by that which happens rather he is disappointed by his perception of that which happens
5903773 if no one is mad at you you probably havent said anything of importance
5903774 sooner or later we all have to choose between what is right and what is easy
5903775 it is not a mistake to have strong views the mistake is to have nothing else
5903776 when people agree with me i always feel that i must be wrong
5903777 share the gospel at all times and when necessary use words
5903778 the early bird gets the worm but the second mouse gets the cheese
5903779 while we are free to do whatever we wish we are not free to have the consequences be whatever we want them to be
5903780 one of the many failings of our educational system is that it sends out into the world people who cannot tell rhetoric from reality
5903781 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
5903782 every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world
5903783 a positive attitude may not solve all your problems but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort
5903784 sin can play a big role in making and keeping us humble a contrite spirit is desired by god in order for me to be contrite i must embrace the good and the bad in me and not take either too seriously
5903785 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
5903786 fanatacism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim
5903787 im really hoping the update helps a lot of existing owners that are frustrated with the difficulty to enjoy the game
5903788 ive spent a lot of time on tuning the difficulty particularly on recruit and soldier and brought more folks through to play it so this should be closer to the mark in being accessible from very casual to hardcore gamers and believe me im still including a challenging mode for those that want it
5903789 with there being so much tragedy in minnesota around binge drinking and student deaths im not going to take any step which deviates from my core message we want our students to behave within the law and we want the ones who are of age to drink responsibly
5903790 adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5903791 we need serious sustained unfettered debate about the drinking age and the reality of life on a college campus and how those two things are aligned
5903792 this emphatically does not mean the age is not being enforced
5903793 it just means that the presidents are being frustrated by the environment and the situation that the drinking age puts them in and that the status quo is not the best way to go about educating young people

5903843 nffc has warned for over a decade that the wtos policies were impoverishing farmers both here and abroad and would lead to an inevitable food crisis the time has come for us to make food sovereignty not free trade our model and get the wto out of agriculture
5903844 the wto bears much responsibility for dismantling domestic and tariff protections and leaving countries at the mercy of volatile speculative markets for their food security as a u s farmer i fully support the right of india and the g 33 countries to implement a special safeguard mechanism ssm to protect their farmers and consumers from below cost imports flooding their markets i am deeply disappointed with other u s farm groups and our government for not endorsing the fundamental principle of food sovereignty
5903845 it is immoral for misguided free trade ideology to take precedence over the starvation of millions of people
5903846 the deregulation of agriculture as advocated by the wto has decimated family farms both here and abroad the u s commodity farm groups backed by agribusiness have propagandized for years that export markets would help family farmers when in reality it just fattens agribusinesss profits
5903847 farmers dont export archer daniels midland and cargill do the corporate commodity groups are continuing to push for bilateral ftas with south korea colombia and pushed for the recent peru fta meanwhile they also scheme to keep in place a broken u s subsidy system that allows u s farmers to be paid below cost of production and agribusiness to dump cheap commodities into overseas markets displacing farmers from mexico to indonesia to ghana to haiti with no benefit to u s farmers the wto promotes a globalized market where all farmers in different countries are pitted in a race to the bottom that only benefits agribusinesses that get access to the cheapest commodities possible we need domestic farm and food policies that respond to the needs of local communities nffcs food from family farms act would have accomplished this while curtailing dumping but congress chose to ignore our proposals during the farm bill
5903848 we have a food crisis water crisis climate crisis but the wto continues to promote export oriented agriculture that only leads to increased deforestation land concentration soil erosion bio diversity destruction and water contamination farmers producing food for local domestic markets have now been replaced by agro export industries such as cut rate flowers in kenya and colombia and devastating agrofuel plantations in brazil and indonesia producing sugar soya and palm oil instead of actual food to feed their citizens here in the u s this has led to monoculture production of corn and soybeans and factory farms instead of diversified farms producing healthy food for local markets
5903849 the perils of having a globalized centralized food system controlled by multinational corporations has been exposed as tainted pet food from china has killed our animals and salmonella tainted peppers from mexico have sickened americans across the country with the collapse of the doha round nffc looks forward to working for a global solution to the food crisis that supports family farmers pays workers a living wage sustains our ecological resources and fosters true democracy
5903850 at a time when dairy farmers in the u s and around the world are experiencing a dire crisis with the rise in our costs of production it is an outrage that u s trade negotiators are going along with the wtos radical deregulatory scheme based on 20 year old numbers from new zealand that have no connection to either current new zealand or u s conditions
5903851 our current costs of production hover over 30 cwt hundredweight it is obscene to sacrifice the livelihoods of dairy farmers our rural communities and our domestic milk production on the altars of a fatally flawed globalization agenda the last thing americans want in the midst of the food crisis is to become dependent on chinese powdered milk but that is the situation that confronts us as american dairy farmers keep going out of business
5903852 our problem is not the legitimate use of prerecorded messages by people out there if there wasnt so much abuse going on we wouldnt support this amendment but people have been using prerecorded calls for cold calls which is inappropriate under the existing business relationship rules and for fraudulent purposes
5903853 trying to get as much information as possible from the business perspective which is a welcome change from five years ago when we went to the do not call list
5903854 we believe a marketers ability to reach consumers is important for jobs and the economy as a whole dma had hoped that the ftc would match the fccs position on this issue by enabling marketers to leave pre recorded messages for consumers with whom they had a pre established business relationship instead the ftc has essentially left their old rule intact and in doing so will increase the administrative costs for marketers a practice that will increase the price of goods for consumers

5903907 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5903908 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5903909 two things are necessary one is the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks we have not seen that happen yet and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again

5903918 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team im a big fan of valencia as a city its a beautiful location and hopefully the race will bring a lot of new fans to formula one

5903949 he blends excellent size vision balance and most of all production hes a power back

5903951 hes big has exceptionally long arms and very quick feet
5903952 he weighs 275 yet looks real thin because hes got room to grow hes a natural at tackle
5903953 hes the ronnie lott of this years class he has brilliant speed but he loves to hit and is excellent in coverage
5903954 he has tight end size with wide receiver athleticism big enough to be a no 1 tight end and fast enough that he could be a wide receiver

5903958 obviously being pushed back is not what i want but at this juncture it needs to happen
5903959 thats what were trying to stay away from anytime theres something wrong with your arm a baseball player especially a pitcher you think of the worst first ive been kind of reassured by people that its not that
5903960 he slept on his arm the other night and he came in and felt some tingling in his fingertips
5903961 as far as pain goes its not that much pain at all with it its something weve monitored over time it hasnt ever festered until now
5903962 i think the bcs formula is so good they ought to take it to basketball baseball tennis and golf and make them go through it
5903963 ive never understood why were the only sport in the world that doesnt have a playoff
5903964 one of the very good things about the bcs is its preservation of bowl arrangements as a reward system for players
5903965 lets remember that the players are the ones who carry the whole system
5903966 it doesnt mean the formula is perfect and weve got everything figured out
5903967 but the fact that people are feeling compelled to tune into college football every saturday means weve done something right
5903968 im very frustrated but theres not much for me to do
5903969 i want to play i want to compete theres only so much time in a career and i want to get out there and help my teammates were in a great situation right now were leading our division and weve got a great chance to go to the playoffs and you want to be a part of that
5903970 its a dangerous area it is in the elbow it is in the tendon
5903971 we didnt expect to have more swelling today you expected to have less swelling and the fact that you have more swelling thats a concern and thats why if it goes that route we have to be more careful and be more conservative
5903972 well just try to match up the best way we can
5903973 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing someone as that person and then that doesnt work out

5903982 are we the team of 2006 that made it to the nfc championship game or are we the team that last year didnt live up to our expectations well we think were the team of 2006 but weve got to go out there on the field and prove it and weve all got to do our job to get to that level thats the goal
5903983 we got to the nfc championship and naturally you just think the next step is the super bowl guaranteed were there
5903984 we had an edge in 06 a little chip on your shoulder with everything that was going on in the city post katrina then last year after the slow start i felt there were some guys that lost confidence and you lose a little confidence and all of a sudden youre in such a deep hole we were never really able to dig ourselves out of it
5903985 we got back to 500 on two occasions but never really got over the hump when are we at our best when we have that edge
5903986 were looking for an overall improvement not one guy thats going to put us over the top its how we can help ourselves in every area
5903987 you can say its the preseason and its going to be ok but i thought defensively we were poor

5904014 acer merupakan vendor pc pertama yang merilis netbook dengan mengadopsi processor intel atom padahal intel sendiri baru akan launching atom bulan depan
5904015 vendor lain yang juga menggunakan intel atom akan meluncurkan netbook sejenis dalam waktu dekat seperti zyrex axioo dan msi
5904016 ya ada roadmapnya jadwalnya masih belum pasti akhir tahun ini masih perkiraan mungkin bisa jadi awal tahun depan
5904017 perbedaannya di samping ada penambahan clock speed 10 process pada gate memory process kita akan compress menjadi delapan process untuk resolusi gambar yang lebih canggih generasi kedua nanti juga mampu mensupport hd di netbook netbook
5904018 kami masih jauh memimpin sebenarnya intel menang di kemampuan teknologi kita selalu selangkah lebih maju dibandingkan kompetitor kompetitor sekarang saja kita sudah memakai 45 nanochip bisa dilihat pada intel atom kompetitor baru memiliki 65 nanochip biarpun mereka nanti akan menjadi 45 juga setidaknya kami selalu selangkah lebih maju dibandingkan mereka
5904019 saat ini netbook sering dijadikan second pc atau second notebook oleh pasar
5904020 biasanya mereka ingin sesuatu yang lebih dari cukup di rumah netbook bisa menjadi alternatif kedua di samping desktop pc orang yang sudah memiliki notebook pun butuh netbook untuk sesuatu yang lebih praktis
5904021 misalnya saja sales agent atau insurance agent mereka hanya membutuhkan aplikasi komputasi yang sederhana tidak butuh spesifikasi yang canggih
5904022 seperti untuk anak anak sekolah atau pun ibu ibu rumah tangga yang mana umumnya mereka tidak membutuhkan aplikasi lebih dari sebuah komputasi sederhana
5904023 netbook tidak akan dibuat dengan layar melebihi 10 inci karena kalau sudah melebihi itu bukan netbook lagi
5904024 jadi kalau mau nonton dvd atau apapun yang membutuhkan rom netbook harus disambungkan ke odd eksternal

5904030 in early july a previous plunge in the companies shares prompted the u s treasury to announce a package of measures aimed at shoring up investor confidence among other things the treasury said it would lend money to the companies or make equity investments in them if needed

5904034 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5904035 broke an already fragile market funding for securities dried up and the cost of interbank borrowing soared as banks lost faith in each other
5904036 the banks exposed themselves too much they took on too much risk its their fault theres no need to blame anyone else

5904049 the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5904050 dan jika kamu mengikuti kebanyakan manusia di muka bumi ini niscaya mereka akan menyesatkan kamu dari jalan allah
5904051 berapa banyak orang yang berpuasa tetapi tidak mendapatkan bagian apa apa dari puasanya kecuali lapar dan dahaga
5904052 sejahat jahat umatku adalah mereka yang melahap segala kenikmatan dan memakan berbagai makanan
5904053 katakanlah wahai muhammad sesungguhnya petunjuk allah lah sebenar benar petunjuk
5904054 dan setiap hal yang baru dalam agama itu bidah dan setiap bidah itu sesat dan setiap kesesatan itu tempatnya dalam neraka

5904060 were actually projecting this year that the north pole may be free of ice for the first time in history
5904061 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
5904062 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
5904063 as you can see ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer with a large increase in the area north of siberia also note that the area around the northwest passage west of greenland has seen a significant increase in ice some of the islands in the canadian archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980
5904064 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat it didnt even come close additionally some current graphs and press releases from nsidc seem less than conservative there appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to arctic ice loss

5904066 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
5904067 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
5904068 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
5904069 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed

5904072 we have some pieces but we have to find our form marcus had some quality finishes hes always a threat that the opposing team has to worry about
5904073 it was great to get the goals but the goals were mainly due to great balls

5904105 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5904106 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5904107 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5904108 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5904109 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5904110 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5904111 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5904112 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5904113 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5904114 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5904115 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5904116 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5904117 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5904118 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5904119 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5904120 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5904121 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5904122 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5904123 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5904124 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5904125 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5904126 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5904127 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5904128 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5904129 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5904130 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done

5904136 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

5904212 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

5904217 hey dolly ive read some feminist theory but im still not sure about this what do you think
5904218 what are ways you think i can address male privilege
5904219 women are just more intelligent than men i know that
5904220 well if you think youve got it all figured out theres no point in me trying to tell you otherwise even if i know youre wrong
5904221 why those feminists just want to subordinate men and make women the rulers of the world

5904224 i got down to hylands house to an entrance to find about 30 people also waiting for richard and waited still trying to get through
5904225 eventually at 1930 approx the phone was the switched off
5904226 on arrival at the venue jays phone was switched off and could not be contacted so i paid an extra 10 to park so i could look for him
5904227 once parked i could still not find jay so i made my way to the ticket collection point at the main entrance and a man from ticketmaster told me that the sos master ticket chap had not turned up and had disappointed hundreds of people
5904228 were aware that unofficial outlets claim to have had v festival tickets for sale
5904229 as concert promoters we urge the public not to get tickets from these secondary ticket outlets whether that be unofficial ticket outlets or through auction sites as it could well lead to disappointment
5904230 were sorry for those who may have been let down from certain sites and recommend checking if its an official site on www vfestival com in future
5904231 trading standards are aware of sos master tickets and are in the process of carrying out an investigation into their activity

5904276 baking bread is a fun way to let at risk students learn that there is more to cooking then fried chicken and greens the high school level children will make bread cakes and muffins as the standard course of study allows but the school has no pans to cook these items until three years ago this school did not even offer any extra classes like family and consumer sciences the students in foods 1 will find the recipes at home in cookbooks or on the internet they will mix the ingredients with our mixer then cook the breads cakes and muffins middle school students will bake also using these pans with much more supervision students share their end products with other students and staff at school this is a two week lesson that can and will be extended because students have shown interest in cake decorating the younger students will decorate cookies they make the students at this school are all at risk students and empowering them to be better people and better at something goes a very long way with them many of these students only eat while at school and this helps make their mind and body stronger my project needs any bakeware items to learn to make breads cakes or muffins the cost of this proposal is 310 which includes shipping for any materials requested and fulfillment

5904329 the record was conceived as a teenage symphony to god that was brian wilsons direct quote a teenage symphony to god it was never released after the label heads put the kibosh on its completion

5904431 it doesnt matter who they appoint we are just getting on with the business

5904569 apart from working out a possible date for the meeting the delegation will also press for a political dialogue
5904570 lots of political will are needed to solve this imbroglio as we are determined not to accept anything less than gorkhaland

5904591 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
5904592 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together
5904593 i have a real issue with this because the commissioner is forcing this on us and it wont save any money
5904594 i cant see spending anymore time on this its not helping education its hurting it
5904595 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
5904596 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
5904597 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
5904598 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has
5904599 if the focus is on the money side it should have been kept on the money side
5904600 wells size allows them to be their own rsu or to be exempt from the consolidation requirement
5904601 im concerned that two weeks after the wells ogunquit combination falls through well get this same letter with another districts name in it

5904612 the most obvious advantage of prosecuting the milf in the hague would be that it would prevent the milf from requiring as condition precedent for the continuation of the peace talks that their men should not be subject to criminal prosecution by local courts
5904613 further the powerful organization of islamic states will inevitably also exert its influence in insisting that milf commanders and men when even when they commit war crimes should not be subject to local criminal prosecutions

5904627 is utilised as a vehicle to forward money to the ltte from canada
5904628 the bank records seized demonstrate that the world tamil movement has developed an elaborate machine like entity that moves throughout the greater toronto area collecting funds with extreme proficiency
5904629 congruent with the money laundering techniques often employed by organized crime groups
5904630 i also believe that the number of accounts alone demonstrate that the world tamil movement has utilised the canadian banking system to raise funds in a manner that is best suited to financing the terrorist activities of the ltte
5904631 it is obvious from the amounts collected with this method that the pre authorized payment scheme is effective timely and spares valued resources
5904632 upon their return to canada these persons were visited by representatives of the world tamil movement to exact the collection of the monthly stipend

5904635 it was a question as to whether a catholic should even be able to run for president
5904636 these are the kinds of cards that popes dont show
5904637 id imagine that he has respect for the president as a man who turned his life around had a conversion experience stopped drinking and started living a religious life
5904638 in terms of authentic normative catholic teaching i dont see any area in which the pope and president bush disagree
5904639 but iraq is not a matter of catholic social teaching
5904640 that was a prudential decision on whether or not the use of force was justified the pope would be the first to tell you that good catholics can disagree on that
5904641 the college presidents who have signed onto this initiative know that some young adults drink they just do
5904642 and with the law the way it is we have to be enforcers were not in a position where we can have a good open conversation with students about drinking responsibly safely and in moderation
5904643 far more teens die in alcohol related incidents than in those caused by all the other illicit drugs combined
5904644 lowering the drinking age to 18 will only make the situation worse
5904645 if they cannot agree on the restoration of the judges in a matter of days then clearly something is not right with the coalition
5904646 we cannot afford to lose months or even weeks on these political issues they need to get to the economy and only a strong government can take the tough decisions needed for the economy

5904657 you cant of course receive communion however you are welcome to come up and receive a blessing from the priest by just crossing your arms across your breast
5904658 please dont take communion since by that gesture you are proclaiming i believe all that the catholic church teaches and proclaims is revealed by god and you dont want to do that unless you mean it and have been received into full communion by the church
5904659 the strong performance of autotrader com for two consecutive years is founded on its most notable strengths the quality of leads and the amount of contact with the dealership both of which are especially important to dealers
5904660 cars com has been steadily improving in the used vehicle lead segment rankings during the past two years so it is not surprising that the service improves from its second rank position in 2007 to earn the highest rank in 2008
5904661 as both new and used vehicle sales decline it is now more important than ever for dealers to cast as wide a net as possible toward the limited supply of vehicle shoppers which is one reason why dealers are increasing their use of online lead providers in the hopes of generating more traffic and sales for their dealerships
5904662 also dealers use vehicle lead notification systems to try to differentiate themselves from their competitors through faster lead response times in this highly competitive industry creating even a slight edge over other dealers is critical during a period of slow sales

5904708 as neither kittery nor wells ogunquit is in an approved configuration i believe there is an opportunity for the two school systems to explore combining central offices sharing resources and administering functions such as special education transportation facilities and maintenance from a single office through an rsu regional school unit or an aos alternative organizational structure
5904709 this would not be the first example of non contiguous units coming together

5904712 im concerned that well go down this path again and not be any further ahead
5904713 the commissioner is holding wells out in order to fix kittery
5904714 it was done for political reasons and for budget reasons they tried to sell a program that didnt have the savings they promised
5904715 one payroll system for the state would have saved a heck of a lot more money than all this has

5904782 consumers are clearly feeling the effects of a perfect storm of challenging economic events such as the mortgage crisis stock market volatility and rising energy costs
5904783 they are reacting by taking a new approach to shopping as our study found that quick trips to the grocery store are declining and major stock up trips that allow consumers to replenish their cupboards for a long period of time are on the upswing
5904784 the reality is that consumers still need to feed their families during these tough times the challenge for them is how to get it done in the most economical way possible without sacrificing quality

5904833 there is reason to believe that gotabhaya rajapaksa has been complicit in a srebrenica like genocide or worse against sri lankas tamils on the installment plan since entering office in november 2005 he has been witness to the extrajudicial killings of more than 1 500 tamils torture scores of kidnappings countless arbitrary detentions and displacement of more than 250 000 a staggering percentage of tamils who have not fled abroad seeking asylum
5904834 denies victims of genocide access to the criminal justice system while using the system against those who did not comply with his genocidal orders he protects promotes and provides impunity to his subordinates in order to secure their willingness to continue committing crimes he could authorize investigations of members of the armed and security forces but the only officers investigated are those who refuse to participate in crimes
5904835 al bashirs motive was control of power his pretext was a counterinsurgency his intent was genocide
5904836 a disappearance every five hours in sri lanka is a result of a deliberate removal of all legal safeguards against illegal detention murder and illegal disposal of bodies
5904837 t he overwhelming majority of victims of human rights violations such as killings and disappearances were young male tamils credible reports cited unlawful killings by government agents assassinations by unknown perpetrators politically motivated killings and child soldier recruitment by paramilitary forces associated with the government disappearances and arbitrary arrests and detentions by years end extrajudicial killings occurred in jaffna on a daily basis and allegedly perpetrated by military intelligence units or associated paramilitaries

5904856 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5904857 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5904858 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5904859 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5904860 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5904861 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5904862 i cant use audacity of hope that might be plagiarizing

5904866 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5904867 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5904868 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5904869 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5904870 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5904871 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5904872 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5904873 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5904874 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5904875 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5904876 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5904877 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5904878 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5904879 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5904880 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5904881 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5904882 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5904883 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5904884 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5904885 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5904886 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5904887 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5904888 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5904889 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5904890 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5904891 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5904892 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5904893 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

5904898 but the rest of the market continues to struggle with the high fixed cost of operating the business
5904899 i dont think much of this was unexpected from the wall street community
5904900 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5904901 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5904902 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5904903 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5904904 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5904905 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5904906 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5904907 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5904908 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5904909 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5904910 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5904911 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5904912 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5904913 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5904914 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5904915 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5904916 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5904917 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5904918 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5904919 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5904920 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5904921 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5904922 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5904923 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5904924 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5904925 were doing well given that the american market was poor last night but the commodities market was very positive and i think thats why bhp and rio are doing so well today
5904926 the banks are a bit wishy washy but theyre not doing too bad
5904927 the decision was based on advice from scholars of islam among several creditable sources that publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community and could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5904928 but unlike the cartoons crisis the reaction has been verbal rather than violent
5904929 you are not to inquire how your trade may be increased nor how you are to become a great and powerful people but how your liberties can be secured for liberty ought to be the direct end of your government
5904930 horse huh how does this work you i go on top of it like above it and it moves im not screw it ill walk
5904931 not only do i spend too much time playing warcraft i hassle those with enough wisdom to avoid it
5904932 hey if you board a plane with this condom full of cocaine stashed someplace unmentionable ill give you a stylish cravat
5904933 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5904934 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5904935 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5904936 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5904937 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5904938 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5904939 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5904940 vi har ju inget dyrt lag j mf rt med andra
5904941 well maybe olympics nats and euro club commitments were too much to ask
5904942 okay but adu just joined a new club just like jozy
5904943 dont jump and twist sideways in a free kick wall

5904947 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5904948 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5904949 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5904950 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5904951 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5904952 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5904953 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5904954 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5904955 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5904956 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5904957 we appreciate the effort chris has put into this role however this is a performance oriented business and when the results are not meeting the expectations we have to make changes
5904958 travis is another example of our willingness to promote from within his depth of knowledge as a racer and engineer as well as his proven ability to work with both drivers and crews will be a great addition to the entire mobil 1 team
5904959 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5904960 mike has wanted to give chris this opportunity and asks that we do the best job that we can to try to prepare him and get him ready to play football
5904961 i was scared at one point that i wouldnt have the opportunity to be back on the field
5904962 it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
5904963 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5904964 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5904965 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left
5904966 hey thats pretty cool great job on getting your run in today yay for finishing those 1k words and w00t for zombies
5904967 a very strong commitment to remaining open in the inner city every neighborhood that had a catholic church will still have a catholic church
5904968 before it was closing the schools now its closing the churches
5904969 they closed this when the population wasnt here to fight for it they wasnt looking for anybodys opinion they just did it their way
5904970 people are working on all the houses across the street were trying to come back
5904971 i think the church will be playing a larger role in a post katrina world not a smaller role
5904972 the poorest of the poor are being hit the hardest now
5904973 we know we will have 18 fewer priests in five years time we would be remiss if we did not prepare
5904974 its very painful my parents were married here i was baptized here where am i supposed to go ive been here all my life now they tell me ive got to get out it dont make no sense
5904975 i can understand the ones that got flood damaged but this was one of the few catholic churches open after katrina people were coming here from all over
5904976 they had a few meetings wrote letters to the bishop we never got any response from them we knew this was coming down we had an idea youd hope we could keep it but its not our say
5904977 its more of a family here at st henrys and thats the problem with the closing its breaking up a family
5904978 the anger that i have inside me is that we met your goals we paid down our debt
5904979 as the catholic church we are the body of christ st paul made clear when the body is wounded in some members all the members suffer but the body is also resilient and can rebound if the medicine applied or the surgery undertaken is in light of the whole
5904980 i went to phoenix houston galveston after the storm i stayed with my son i just wanted to come back home
5904981 youve been here all your life shoot its hard to leave
5904982 i was raised up catholic my children were married in st davids church my husband was buried in there its a part of the life
5904983 while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio fuel
5904984 but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic
5904985 i am sorry for that disruption we cannot proceed with the meeting without matsuuras party we will continue with this meeting as soon as it is most convinient to all again i am deeply sorry
5904986 we will i just had a link set up in my office before the meeting we will meet up with ken there
5904987 im asking you what the hell is wrong with you old goat you think you own this place

5905013 i know wei i miss her too anyway im glad that you find her a praise worthy choice
5905014 well master hitomi she does strike me as a lady of refinement unlike someone we know
5905015 i know you didnt like miki wei but its not nice to compare mama wouldnt like that you know
5905016 see what i mean only a real lady would choose tea over coffee

5905024 yes but they were returned to me the addressee moved house during our correspondence and she didnt tell me where she moved all the letters have return to sender stamped on them

5905030 i dont even remember i was very young when i wrote those letters and i havent seen these letters in years if you find them please send them over
5905031 how can she be so full of self confidence even though shes a newcomer
5905032 i have to act and say things upon my own emotions
5905033 but it doesnt have to be like that its ok to say things that are more humane
5905034 i want to be true to myself i want to be honest
5905035 i dont understand young people nowadays anyway so ill leave it to ayaya and nino you can change the lines too just play the roles the way you want and teach me how kids nowadays think
5905036 we think about a lot of things too even though you might not expect it
5905037 what kind of person is he she what are his her intentions
5905038 you never wanted to change grades or change classes ever when you were in preschool you cried when you changed from the blue room to the yellow room
5905039 trim required min length 5 max length 12 xss clean
5905040 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing and squishing and everything
5905041 i just wanted to kind of get rid of this whole thing for me
5905042 this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5905043 my decision after looking at all the treatment plans that were possibilities for me the only one that seemed the most logical and the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
5905044 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5905045 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5905046 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5905047 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5905048 big cats and dinosaurs if you see any of those give us a call
5905049 once he perpetrated a fraud that goes into his credibility and integrity
5905050 with the exception of peak periods i think normally we would be looking at a 299 fare from kuala lumpur to london so all in a return flight of within 1000 mr osman rani said
5905051 that would probably be in the first half of next year as soon as we get our uk service going
5905052 when we start tapping into some of the growing markets especially central and eastern europe there will be a lot of interest to come down here as well
5905053 many malaysians send their children to universities in melbourne and with our notorious low fares families can now visit their children in melbourne more often and turn their trip into a holiday ms tan said
5905054 australians also are avid travellers and what better way than to have low fares to get them to see the multicolour cultures of malaysia exciting shopping and sample local cuisines
5905055 there were about 600 000 in sydney and probably about 350 to 400 000 in melbourne
5905056 it was about 20 per cent of the australian population at the time
5905057 people think they were painted especially for this tour but in fact all american naval vessels were painted white in peacetime and only switched to grey in times of war
5905058 there are no other national science award schemes anywhere in the world with the breadth and scope of these prizes
5905059 it is very low cost very simple everyones got an inkjet printer on their desk at the moment you can buy one for 50 and were using very very cheap patterning techniques to make these solar cells
5905060 its a fascinating question to tackle to think about how we can ensure that the earth can continue to survive and that everyone on it can continue to live at peace i think is a fantastic thing to work on
5905061 protein will win and that can then therefore drive you to over consume diets which are too low in their percentage of protein or indeed under consume and hence potentially lose weight on diets that are relatively high in protein
5905062 i decided just to cancel school altogether and save 100 per cent of carbon emissions obviously im still going to school so it didnt really work
5905063 i got it back pretty quickly but from sunup to sundown i worked pretty hard at it
5905064 to shoot 65 to do it makes it that much better i feel really good about the way ive been playing
5905065 i had some moments of greatness mixed in with some pretty awful shots
5905066 that was the hard part im not saying that match play is easy but i just feel more comfortable knowing i can take a deep breath and validate my game
5905067 using a really conservative estimate using the largest possible size of shark using a low fin to weight ratio thats still 10 000 sharks that would have needed to be killed for that amount of fin
5905068 start protecting places like osprey reef out in the coral sea one of the few places in the world where sharks come in large numbers they aggregate there
5905069 another key action that were calling for is that we want the queensland government to shelve its plans for creating a shark fishery literally in the great barrier reef world heritage area
5905070 currently theres around 1 400 licences that can be utilised to take shark in queensland waters the proposal is to reduce that to 200 licences and restrict the catch to a precautionary level of 700 tonnes
5905071 i want to be absolutely convinced on the basis of the material that comes to me that we can agree with the queensland government on a management plan that sees fisheries managed sustainably and which doesnt see impacts on fish species and an impact that has been reflected in the figures that have been released today
5905072 there was a whole change right through the ecosystem and the scallop fishery collapsed because with the loss of the sharks the rays increased dramatically and they ate all the scallops and so the fishery collapsed because of the fishery for sharks so you lost two fisheries
5905073 mit der ver ffentlichung unserer neuen version hoffen wir das video bloggen massentauglich zu machen
5905074 prince christian had taken off his bathing shorts and didnt want to put them back on
5905075 the crown princess and crown prince became aware that there were photographers who had taken photos
5905076 they asked them not to use these photos and the photographers said ok fine
5905077 just to make sure that everything was ok i called three weeklies in denmark the three magazines that were present at the time and asked them if they would please not use those photographs
5905078 two said of course they would not but the third said they would
5905079 every summer the queen hosts her family her sisters and their husbands and children and grandchildren
5905080 the highlight of that event is the royals invite the press to come and take some pictures of the whole family
5905081 when the press show up at this event there is no frederik and mary when the queen is asked why theyre not there she says they are stuck in traffic
5905082 clearly what happened was that frederik and mary decided to boycott this event because the editor went ahead and published these pictures
5905083 it would have been tempting but its not the case the two incidents had nothing to do with each other
5905084 kenapa ngga selama ini kita masih nyoba nyoba kalau cocok kenapa nggak
5905085 torna se cada vez mais fora da lei neste conflito
5905086 this year has been the worst in terms of the increase in costs
5905087 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5905088 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5905089 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5905090 the repugnant aspect is his attack on the morality and ethics of human beings who are trying to work with a very difficult population
5905091 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5905092 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime

5905097 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
5905098 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
5905099 we promised kashmiris a plebiscite six decades ago let us hold one now and give them three choices independence union with pakistan and union with india almost certainly the valley will opt for independence jammu will opt to stay with india and probably ladakh too let kashmiris decide the outcome not the politicians and armies of india and pakistan
5905100 if you are economically strong you can fight for your independence if you are weak then you have nothing
5905101 we are kashmiris not indians earlier my mother used to tell me not to join protests but yesterday even my mother was in the protest with me
5905102 the u n the u s britain and international community to come and see what people want here
5905103 if the experience of the last two decades has taught us anything it is that the situation never really returns to normal even when we see the outward symptoms of peace we miss the alienation and resentment within no matter what we do things never get better for very long
5905104 i reckon we should hold a referendum in the valley let the kashmiris determine their own destiny if they want to stay in india they are welcome but if they dont then we have no moral right to force them to remain if they vote for integration with pakistan all this will mean is that azad kashmir will gain a little more territory if they opt for independence they will last for about 15 minutes without the billions that india has showered on them but it will be their decision
5905105 if the experience of the last two decades has taught us anything it is that the situation never really returns to normal even when we see the outward symptoms of peace we miss the alienation and resentment within no matter what we do things never get better for very long
5905106 i reckon we should hold a referendum in the valley let the kashmiris determine their own destiny if they want to stay in india they are welcome but if they dont then we have no moral right to force them to remain if they vote for integration with pakistan all this will mean is that azad kashmir will gain a little more territory if they opt for independence they will last for about 15 minutes without the billions that india has showered on them but it will be their decision
5905107 whatever happens how can india lose if you believe in democracy then giving kashmiris the right to self determination is the correct thing to do and even if you dont surely we will be better off being rid of this constant painful strain on our resources our lives and our honour as a nation this is indias century we have the world to conquer the other and the means to do it kashmir is a 20th century problem we cannot let it drag us down and bleed us as we assume our rightful place in the world its time to think the unthinkable
5905108 i was once hopeful of kashmirs integration but after six decades of effort kashmiri alienation looks greater than ever india seeks to integrate with kashmir not rule it colonially yet the parallels between british rule in india and indian rule in kashmir have become too close for my comfort
5905109 we promised kashmiris a plebiscite six decades ago let us hold one now and give them three choices independence union with pakistan and union with india almost certainly the valley will opt for independence jammu will opt to stay with india and probably ladakh too let kashmiris decide the outcome not the politicians and armies of india and pakistan

5905124 we promised kashmirisa plebiscite six decades ago let us hold one now and give them three choices independence union withpakistan and union with india almost certainly the valley will opt for independence jammuwill opt to stay with india and probably ladakh too let kashmiris decide the outcome not the politicians and armies of india and pakistan

5905128 the u n should send its peacekeepers to jammu as well as kashmir
5905129 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution

5905200 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5905201 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5905202 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5905203 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5905204 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5905205 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5905206 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
5905207 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
5905208 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5905209 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5905210 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5905211 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5905212 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5905213 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5905214 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5905215 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5905216 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5905217 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5905218 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5905219 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5905220 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5905221 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5905222 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5905223 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5905224 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5905225 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5905226 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5905227 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5905228 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5905229 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5905230 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5905231 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5905232 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5905233 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5905234 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5905235 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5905236 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5905237 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5905238 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5905239 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5905240 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5905241 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5905242 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5905243 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5905244 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5905245 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5905246 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5905247 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5905248 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5905249 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5905250 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5905251 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5905252 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5905253 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5905254 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5905255 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5905256 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5905257 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5905258 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5905259 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5905260 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5905261 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5905262 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5905263 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5905264 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5905265 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5905266 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5905267 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5905268 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5905269 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5905270 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5905271 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5905274 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5905275 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
5905276 the important thing here is an adherence to the undertakings that russia has signed onto
5905277 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution
5905278 but in order for this plan to be implemented there is an essential prerequisite which is withdrawal of russian forces
5905279 two things are necessary one is the pullback of georgian forces to their barracks we have not seen that happen yet and secondly we need to be assured that our peacekeepers are not going to be attacked again
5905280 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5905281 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5905282 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5905283 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5905284 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5905285 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5905286 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5905287 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5905288 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5905289 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5905290 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental

5905297 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5905298 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5905299 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5905300 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5905301 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5905345 but my preferred method for instance is to link the company logo in a post to the crunchbase profile and the first mention of the company in a post to its website
5905346 the simplest and most intuitive way was to click on the logo
5905347 but that is because we think its a really good resource
5905348 search google and look at how crunchbase shows up in the top 10 results this is why crunchbase is link worthy
5905349 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5905350 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5905351 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5905352 you didnt get this from me but use it as you will
5905353 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
5905354 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
5905355 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
5905356 firstly we must continue to invest in our strategic priorities
5905357 secondly we must maintain our conviction for the way we manage money
5905358 finally we must respond to the overall decline in market levels by continuing to review elements of controversial
5905359 deleveraging of the company including partial sales of the companys holdings in copenhagen and brussels airports
5905360 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance she said
5905361 feedback from our active program of engagement with investors has highlighted a changed attitude towards acceptable levels of leverage
5905362 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline
5905363 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the current external environment represents an excellent achievement and demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
5905364 we recognise that our airline customers face challenging conditions but the first half result is evidence of the importance of investing in airports with attractive characteristics and opportunities across the aviation and commercial businesses
5905365 whilst our financial position is very sound we recognise that attitudes towards leverage have changed if not permanently then for the foreseeable future
5905366 consequently we are applying our surplus cash to the repayment of our hybrid capital instrument tickets which will simplify maps capital structure
5905367 whilst there is no provision for early redemption we are offering tickets holders a withdrawal option with any remaining balance to be defeased and repaid on 1 january 2010
5905368 the discount to valuation which the current security price represents remains near record levels
5905369 a buyback of this scale also aids the quality and sustainability of our distributions and our commitment to achieve broad convergence between our regular distribution and proportionate earnings by 2010
5905370 conducted at prices that reflect our full directors valuations generating substantial premia to the prices for maps original investment of 49 per cent for copenhagen and 47 per cent for brussels
5905371 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
5905372 asur meets maps key investment criteria and we expect the returns from this investment to be well above that offered by current and proposed major airport privatisations
5905373 we believe this investment demonstrates maps continued ability to source attractive growth opportunities
5905374 results were significantly affected by further declines in the us housing market where housing starts fell 35 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year the company said
5905375 our main businesses operated in markets that were affected by downturns particularly in the us where the downturn was the most severe chief executive louis gries said
5905376 despite this we continued to focus on driving primary demand for fibre cement products in north america with strategies aimed at increasing our share of the us siding and backer board markets
5905377 although we expect our volume to remain below prior year as a result of a continuing decline in housing markets we expect our differentiated product strategy will allow us to maintain selling price and increase market share
5905378 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5905379 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5905380 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5905381 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5905382 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5905383 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5905384 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5905385 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5905386 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5905387 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5905388 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5905389 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5905390 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5905391 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5905392 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5905393 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5905394 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5905395 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5905396 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5905397 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5905398 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5905399 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5905400 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5905401 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5905402 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5905403 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5905404 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5905405 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5905406 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5905407 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5905408 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5905409 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5905410 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5905411 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5905412 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5905413 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5905414 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5905415 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5905416 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5905417 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5905418 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5905419 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5905420 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5905421 produ o o catador de batatas e o filho da costureira
5905422 he had joined the companies as a data operator in a very short span he learned software and became a wiz he was so good that he became an expert troubleshooter in the companies his colleagues say he had a solution to all their problems
5905423 he is the person who had designed an elaborate proxy website and would have knowledge of java c and visual basic programming languages
5905424 proxy server is a masking website that removes the cyber prints of the surfer at such times when the website is traced what the investigators get is the address of a proxy server and not the real website if the person can attach such a facility to the website he should have at least a qualification of a masters in computer applications mca to master the art
5905425 abdul is a very senior simi operative of the country who assigns secret codes to all the sleeper cells of im which only he knows
5905426 on march 27 2008 abdul was present with safdar nagori in indore but managed to slip away because police did not know him
5905427 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5905428 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5905429 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5905430 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5905431 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5905432 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5905433 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5905434 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5905435 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5905436 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5905437 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5905438 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5905439 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5905440 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5905441 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5905442 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5905443 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5905444 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5905445 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5905446 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5905447 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5905448 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5905449 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5905450 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5905451 i prefer month long pilgrimage starting from vyas purnima and culminating on shravan purnima which has religious significance as per our scriptures and practice
5905452 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5905453 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5905454 we should build up cooperation between the tni indonesian armed forces and the hawaiian national guard to beef up professionalism at the level of soldiers and low ranking officers on maintenance of military equipment such as helicopters and other equipment made by the united states
5905455 in the coming months scores of our soldiers will be sent to hawaii to get trainings of the maintenance which could boost the capacity of troops
5905456 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5905457 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5905458 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5905459 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5905460 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5905461 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5905462 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5905463 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5905464 this is a planning took where all things are going
5905465 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5905466 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5905467 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5905468 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5905469 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5905470 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5905471 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5905472 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5905473 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5905474 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5905475 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5905476 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5905477 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5905478 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5905479 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5905480 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5905481 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5905482 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5905483 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5905484 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5905485 advanis pronouncement to lead the shri amarnath sangarsh samiti sass rally in jammu on august 25 has uncovered the concealed nexus of the samiti with the sangh parivar

5905487 the afspa has been used to violate fundamental freedoms for 50 years and should be repealed
5905488 getting away with murder 50 years of the armed forces special powers act describes how the afspa has become a tool of state abuse oppression and discrimination
5905489 the indian governments responsibility to protect civilians from attacks by militants is no excuse for an abusive law like the afspa
5905490 the growth of militant groups under the 50 year application of the afspa is a proof in itself that countering armed insurgency with disregard for human rights is ineffective

5905493 only yesterday the results of jades test were out conducted in uk before her departure to india and the tests indicate the possibility of cancer
5905494 we still dont know whats wrong but yes it is a cancer scare jade has undergone a series of tests but doctors cant pinpoint the problem
5905495 everyone was waiting to see how jade would survive in the house since she doesnt speak the language it was obvious that she wouldnt remain very long in the house my feeling is she had the results with her before she entered the show and they are only being revealed now i think endemol wanted to rid themselves of the whole racist tag that they earned courtesy jade and they wanted to clear that by getting her to india and they managed to do that
5905496 right now they are considering that shamita would indeed add something to the show
5905497 i am very excited about the show this is the first time that saif and i are performing together i have got a huge fan following in dubai because of jab we met

5905551 first for one thing another round of huge write offs would as they say end all doubt regarding a u s recession we would record negative gdp for q3 and q4 at minimum most likely for q1 2009 as well
5905552 second youre looking at additional consolidation in investment banking and commercial banking
5905553 third there would be considerable u s government involvement the scope and amount of intervention by the u s treasury and fed u s federal reserve is difficult to specify until the size of the problem is known
5905554 would most likely propel congressionally backed federally directed structural changes in banking mortgage finance securities and financial regulation
5905555 its one thing if the nature of the bailout is another 50 or 100 billion but if it amounts to the takeover of a massive bank or fre the american economy would see its biggest changes since the new deal

5905644 banks who sign up to the equator principles are at continuing risk of financing projects that fail to uphold human rights
5905645 australian banks should be aware that signing the equator principles does not mean the projects they finance respect human rights including the rights to life property food and health
5905646 through oxfam australias mining ombudsman program we have documented that a failure to respect human rights and a failure to have effective grievance mechanisms can not only leave communities worse off but can also lead to financial failure
5905647 during that time anz and other banks who signed the equator principles continued to prop up the company
5905648 signing onto the principles has not led to anz or other banks ensuring respect for human rights the end result was people in developing countries lost out

5905681 americans across our country are hurting because of the cost of energy
5905682 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families and now as people prepare for the winter they are going to be hit with higher costs for home heating oil it is time for america to get serious about energy independence and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this
5905683 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it this platform we are at today sits above a field of 160 million barrels of oil and is capable of producing on a daily basis 55 000 barrels of oil and 72 million cubic feet of natural gas
5905684 there is no volume control only an on off switch and it is imperative that it remain in the on mode
5905685 who else is going to interpret and translate yoshi i certainly dont understand what yoshi is saying
5905686 can you at least allow us to move his speaker away from the overhead microphones
5905687 certainly i dont want you to get the impression that we are unreasonable or anything
5905688 a career in quantum physics is far more noble and soul satisfying than the jail sentence of videotaping cross dresser for a uhf station
5905689 no more getting jacked around by music industry types who fancy themselves as taste makers or svengali figures but who in all actuality just want to poke some stripper after promising her a record contract
5905690 he has written this play mister coyote about a coyote who comes down from the hills of beverly hills and mounts a beverly hills housewife we can just adapt his dialogue to song lyrics
5905691 gentlemen im having trouble getting funding for my latest theatrical endeavor
5905692 we want to take your play ideas and turn them into a concept album a sort of nonlinear anti rock opera
5905693 i see your voice as equal parts faye greener the anti heroine from the day of the locust and any gold digging femme fatale hussy from a raymond chandler novel
5905694 in other words you cant blame mr coyote for being a coyote the human being is at fault as we as a species should know better
5905695 if it was successful in two demographics already whats to stop it from charting on a third
5905696 on the other at what point is this merely hipster revisionism as bz would say
5905697 look we dont have time to crunch the philosophical data on the whether or not this is a good idea
5905698 we need a record that music industry types already understand

5905702 if you try to improve on it not only will you make it worse you will further compromise our purity of tone
5905703 no it was great but there is a modulation in the song that we have to acknowledge
5905704 ummm after the second chorus going into the third verse the song modulates it moves up a half step
5905705 all right the song is in the key of c after the second chorus it moves into c
5905706 okay c is the white keys c is a bunch of black ones when i punch you in after second chorus go to a bunch of black ones
5905707 that reality fellow is an epic figure of our time
5905708 have you ever looked at a chicken who has had its head cut off we are living in an age where you stick your head into the disembodied head of the chicken
5905709 no she sings standards she has no clue what we are singing about
5905710 this could be genius get a lounge singer who has no concept about what we are about to be our meta faye greener and have her unwittingly sing about the apocalypse
5905711 because if i worked for central casting and i was looking for a geisha for the apocalypse to sing on a braindead soundmachine record her name would be khalsoum and your picture is the one i would keep the fact that you can sing is a bonus
5905712 no machine can replace me until it can learn how to drink

5905724 it changes the weather patterns and cloud formations in manhattan
5905725 meaning in nature small changes in input equal large changes in output
5905726 that is a basic tenet of the chaos theory our programming and our machines must be analogous to what happens in nature when we push a button or adjust an algorithm chaos must ensue
5905727 this is not what i had in mind at all
5905728 look the soundmachine is a postmodern attack on the age we live in and we cannot use contemporary electronics in that assault we are a postcard from the past and a polaroid of the future either the past or the future is far more takeable than what is happening now

5906157 the numb3rs art department did an amazing job building a big time comics show from scratch
5906158 my son and i walked into a lush parallel world of comic dom where nocturnals appears to be very very popular and there are possibly too many female fans mostly they got it right and we felt at home for the next two days of shooting
5906159 they dont usually place authentic people in sets so the background people extras and many of the cast were excited to have us there
5906160 extras and some crew who didnt know us were continually shocked to see some of us actually sketching at our tables theyd assumed we were actors i can vouch for one thing after the last two days of reactions and background work they wont get me confused with an actor ever
5906161 i met another writer for the show sean crouch who has an engineering degree and wrote a college paper citing doc horror
5906162 i was continually surprised by the level of professionalism patience and skill of the cast and crew they were lovely people and made the tedium that can come of a long shooting day more bearable numb3rs art director katherine leblond has some kind of magic touch she not only orchestrated the design and construction of a great faux comic con she took wonderful care of us high maintenance artist types
5906163 ken and i used to have long talks during the time i was writing black planet
5906164 for me to make sure the cops in my story reacted to doc horror in a way that felt authentic
5906165 ken was one of the few people who saw the merits of combining the genres of crime and horror into a single new story effort there wasnt much of that being done back then as opposed to now
5906166 but the nocturnals does work and it works in a truly inventive way
5906167 weve got mounds of evidence that an extremely powerful and unprecedented climate driven change is underway
5906168 its not that this might happen these changes are underway and there are more changes coming
5906169 if you believe in forever then life is just a one night stand

5906172 the combination of black ceramic alloy and tungsten carbide makes the zurnov very popular with men looking for a truly contemporary design
5906173 this newly designed tungsten ring embodies the design traits that fashion savvy customers look for when quality and style must counterbalance a masculine appeal we are pleased with the response to this design and inspired to design even more best selling tungsten rings
5906174 wouldnt be seen dead in a ditch with a semi colon though truman capote might real men goes the unwritten rule of american punctuation dont use semi colons
5906175 the most pusillanimous sissified utterly useless mark of punctuation ever invented
5906176 arbitrariness as if the semicolon were a mark of choice rather than rule
5906177 its like a slur in music leading you to the next thought without making you stop to rest
5906178 a stunning drop in semicolon usage between the 18th and 19th centuries from 68 1 semicolons per thousand words to just 17 7

5906180 a man in his 20s is recovering in hospital after being stabbed as he sat in his car at a major intersection in brampton late tuesday afternoon
5906181 if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone behold the new has come
5906182 i have been crucified with christ it is no longer i who live but christ who lives in me and this life that i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of the god who loved me and gave himself for me
5906183 his presence in the christian is the assurance of god to bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of christ
5906184 his presence in the christian is the guarantee that god will emphasis mine bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of christ
5906185 against you you only have i sinned and done what is evil in your sight so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment
5906186 those who boast will not stand in the sight of your eyes you hate everyone who does iniquity
5906187 see now that i even i am he and there is no god beside me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal and there is none that can deliver out of my hand
5906188 yahweh preserves all who love him but the wicked he will destroy
5906189 for if while we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more now that we are reconciled shall we be saved by his life
5906190 every evil of theirs is in gilgal there i began to hate them because of the wickedness of their deeds i will drive them out of my house i will love them no more all their princes are rebels
5906191 i hate i despise your feasts and i take no delight in your solemn assemblies even though you offer me your burnt offerings and grain offerings i will not accept them and the peace offerings of your fattened animals i will not look upon them take away from me the noise of your songs to the melody of your harps i will not listen but let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
5906192 if any man worships the beast and his image and receives the mark on his forehead or on his hand even he himself will drink of the cup of the passionate anger of god
5906193 those who worship the beast and his image or if anyone receives the mark of his name
5906194 how long o simple ones will you love being simple how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge if you turn at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit to you i will make my words known to you because i have called and you refused to listen have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when terror strikes you when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind when distress and anguish come upon you then they will call upon me but i will not answer they will seek me diligently but will not find me because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of yahweh would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and have their fill of their own devices for the simple are killed by their turning away and the complacency of fools destroys them but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease without dread of disaster
5906195 and the sea gave up the dead who were in it death and hades gave up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one of them according to what they had done
5906196 here is the perseverance of the saints those who are keeping gods commandments and the faith of jesus
5906197 for while we were still weak at the right time christ died for the ungodly for one will scarcely die for a righteous person though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die but god shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners christ died for us since therefore we have now been justified by his blood much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of god
5906198 even he himself will drink of the wine of the passionate anger of god
5906199 since someone will worship the beast then we also know that exact one will drink of gods passionate anger
5906200 keep far from a false charge and do not kill the innocent and righteous for i will not acquit the wicked
5906201 he will guard the feet of his faithful ones but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness for not by might will a man prevail
5906202 its just the fact that you arent alone that some of the people here have the same battles as you
5906203 it doesnt dim the fact that you grew up in a war zone
5906204 i had demons and i knew i was going to have to deal with them
5906205 we have patients that really have come from personal history of a war zone
5906206 were finding that probably 70 percent of clients in the mental health system have a history of trauma
5906207 violence neglect disaster war and other emotionally destructive experiences create trauma
5906208 the cost of trauma to the community is enormous on several accounts as it produces emotional physical and economic effects
5906209 people with a trauma history often have a history of drug and alcohol abuse
5906210 clients referred to the program receive a comprehensive evaluation a screening for drug and alcohol abuse and a current life stressor inventory
5906211 many clients are also enrolled in the pathways program at kmhs our co occuring disorders treatment program as many clients will have substance abuse and trauma related issues that need to be addressed simultaneously
5906212 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5906213 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5906214 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5906215 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5906216 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5906217 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5906218 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5906219 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5906220 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5906221 we really want to get the message out to people
5906222 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5906223 the private public rhetoric on health care is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
5906224 if our governments are unable to fund the education of the number of doctors we need we must consider alternatives public private partnerships are used in such circumstances to build infrastructure including roads bridges and hospitals lets explore similar initiatives to develop new medical schools
5906225 shocking that 1 500 young highly educated canadians are currently attending medical schools outside of canada
5906226 we must not deny any patient access to essential health care based on ability to pay nor should we deny access based on a shortage of doctors hospital beds or operating time
5906227 competition consumer choice and market principles barely exist in our health system yet health care is subject to normal economic pressures and principles
5906228 as we meet at the time of the olympic games and as canada looks forward to hosting the 2010 winter games lets note that three of the six main olympic values excellence universality sustainability are similar to our values and aspirations for a truly great health system
5906229 and of course an integral part of the olympics is competition without competition we cannot expect improvement let alone excellence
5906230 i believe that if we are to preserve universal health care for the next generation we need to embrace similar principles
5906231 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health care system
5906232 collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health for example in last octobers throne speech i listened as the topic of health care was almost completely ignored by our conservative government
5906233 not to be outdone the liberal party of canada recently sent out a questionnaire based on what they identified as todays issues of crucial significance
5906234 of 16 questions in their poll not one question related to health care
5906235 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventive medicine
5906236 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5906237 a horrific travesty of a judicial decision in which a bunch of activist ohio supreme court justices flagrantly lied about the intent and goals of the ohio legislatures efforts to keep ohio children safe from repeat pervs like gerry porter
5906238 i would prefer my exams to be graded on objective criteria
5906239 a judge is a law student who grades his own papers
5906240 the mid term paper will not be blind graded and it will be combined in a student beneficial way with my grading of class participation
5906241 rest in part on a faulty assumption about the retributive force of the death penalty
5906242 if we are going to do capital punishment it needs to be done in the most humane manner
5906243 opponents of the death penalty are echoing justice stevens comment in baze v
5906244 the standard we set forth here resolves more challenges than he acknowledges
5906245 standard we set forth here resolves more challenges than stevens acknowledges
5906246 we do not agree with justice stevens that anything in our opinion undermines or remotely addresses the validity of capital punishment
5906247 rest in part on a faulty assumption about the retributive force of the death penalty
5906248 we are justified in punishing because and only because offenders deserve it
5906249 for a retributivist the moral culpability of the offender also gives society the duty to punish
5906250 if a politician doesnt wanna get beat up he shouldnt run for office
5906251 if a politician doesnt wanna get beat up he shouldnt run for office if a football player doesnt want to get tackled or want the risk of an a occasional clip he shouldnt put the pads on
5906252 on a proportional basis 40 000 prisoners is a higher percentage than the soviet union imprisoned at the height of the evil empire
5906253 the sentencing commission which was and to this day remains dominated by prosecutors and law enforcement special interest groups whose obvious prejudice is exactly opposite of a local responsibility in sentencing law
5906254 does anyone remember the criminal defense bar warning that we cannot build our way out of the overcrowding problem
5906255 but that is just the opinion of a criminal defense lawyer and therefore easily ignored
5906256 has voiced support for the right of state and local governments to regulate guns
5906257 castration has done precisely what i wanted it to do
5906258 i have not had any sexual urges or desires in over two years my mind is finally free of the deviant sexual fantasies i used to have about young girls
5906259 i think it would do a lot to prevent recidivism and the amount of money we have to spend on treatment centers like the one im in
5906260 while rep x says he is tough on crime when he had the chance to vote in columbus rep x voted to allow convicted rapists to live next to our childrens schools
5906261 its not surprising then they get bitter they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5906262 you cant treat the citizens of some states differently than other states
5906263 what i tried to assert is that the dnc has the right to make rules but the rules have to be the same for all the states
5906264 beyond the sheer number of inmates america also is the global leader in the rate at which it incarcerates its citizenry outpacing nations like south africa and iran
5906265 rather it flows principally from a wave of policy choices that are sending more lawbreakers to prison and through the popular three strikes measures and other sentencing enhancements keeping them there longer
5906266 we are using tens of billions of dollars of our domestic resources to incarcerate individuals who would be much better off either under community supervision or in a public health treatment programme
5906267 our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time
5906268 there hasnt been a clear and convincing return for public safety
5906269 i almost raised my hand to ask why lloyd cutlers washington law firm spends thousands of dollars to recruit law students to represent the wealthiest clients if cutler was really so disturbed
5906270 seventy percent enter saying that they want to do public interest work 95 percent leave to work in law firms banks and the like
5906271 i want to go to law school to make a lot of money
5906272 we have no idea about it and no written record of it
5906273 as its almost a year to go to the introduction of a lay judge system in japan we want to give people an opportunity to think about the possibility that they may be in the position to decide on a death penalty
5906274 ik weet zeker dat de miljoenen van maloof erg goed van pas komen nu britneys vader de macht heeft over haar bezittingen
5906275 als ik getrouwd zou zijn en kinderen zou hebben moet ik elke dag om zes uur thuis zijn dan zou het gedaan zijn met rond te hangen met paris of britney
5906276 roughly 20 of the 25 cp grade come s from the paper

5906280 if theres a way in which congress can publicly support these changes they will have more strength theres a credibility that congress has through its process they can also hear viewpoints from different people
5906281 this is not a revolutionary concept for congress to be more involved
5906282 an historian economist doctor accountant soldier or some other nonlawyer professional should be appointed to the court
5906283 an historian economist doctor accountant soldier or some other nonlawyer professional
5906284 why dont we bring an economist in to see if they think your cough sounds like pneumonia
5906285 or maybe i just like to think there is a reasoning we are forced to suffer through 3 years of law school
5906286 lawyers have systematic and correlated biases induced by common professional training but a bench composed of both nonlawyers and lawyers will have uncorrelated or random biases or at least a lower degree of correlation the aggregate decisionmaking competence of the group will thus improve if the court contains at least some lay justices
5906287 if i would have known that the seriousness of what i was doing i would not have filed charges i love frank and he is good to my grandbabies and he is good to my daughter and it just breaks my heart that for the rest of his life hes gonna be labeled a sex offender
5906288 while it seems unfair he was 19 she was 15 thats the price you pay even if you end up getting married we are a country of laws and thats the law
5906289 technology supported learning has been increasingly used across a broad spectrum of educational contexts in many cases being integrated with more traditional forms of teaching

5906291 we were in the kitchen and colin went out for something and said what the hell s all that noise

5906294 the first finding as explained is formulated thus by ulrich warnke
5906295 recently approved pesticides have been implicated in massive bee die offs and are the focus of increasing scientific scrutiny
5906296 epa should be evaluating the risks to bees before approving new pesticides but now refuses to tell the public what it knows pesticide restrictions might be at the heart of the solution to this growing crisis so why hide the information they should be using to make those decisions
5906297 epa needs to help shed some light so that researchers can get to work on this problem this isnt just an issue for farmers this is an issue that concerns us all just try to imagine a pizza without the contribution of bees no tomatoes no cheese no peppers if you eat apples cucumbers broccoli onions squash carrots avocados or cherries you need to be concerned

5906322 major league baseball responding by saying it canceled the wednesday call because it doesnt have a replay agreement with the union necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out

5906324 the third school is vajrayana buddhism commonly referred to as tibetan buddhism this form of buddhism is technically a part of mahayana based on tantric buddhism which arose in around 500 ce and employed the use of spells symbols and complicated rituals to reach enlightenment buddhism had entered tibet in around 200 ce but had come under its own system as buddhist monks took to controlling society and enforcing their own edicts and morals on others their theocracy engrained patriarchy into tibetan society severely repressing women and found a need to make the acts of reincarnation official to keep power in the hands of the monks only the monks could proclaim who was the next high ranking official of the empire aka the reincarnation of the last emperor this high level of stratification and ranks dictated through reincarnation was necessary for running a feudalist society tibetan buddhism takes belief in the supernatural a step further believing in a dalai lama who is much like a god on earth

5906341 how many times must we relearn the lessons of prohibition adults under 21 are deemed capable of voting signing contracts serving on juries and enlisting in the military but are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5906342 we have this law that in effect prevents any state from exploring new ways of addressing the issue we have a crisis on our hands we need some new ideas and new thinking
5906343 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower

5906345 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5906346 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5906347 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5906348 he just has to swallow hard and do what jfk did
5906349 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5906350 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5906351 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

5906362 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5906363 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5906364 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5906365 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5906366 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5906367 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5906368 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5906369 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5906370 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5906371 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5906372 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5906373 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5906374 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5906375 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5906376 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5906378 what the hell to do with my preschooler who is too smart for her own good
5906379 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5906380 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5906381 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5906382 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5906383 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5906384 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5906385 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5906386 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5906387 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5906388 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5906389 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5906390 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5906391 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5906392 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5906393 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5906394 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5906395 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5906396 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5906397 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5906398 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5906399 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5906400 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5906401 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5906402 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5906403 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5906404 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5906405 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5906406 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5906407 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5906408 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5906409 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5906410 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5906411 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5906412 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5906413 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5906414 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5906415 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5906416 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5906417 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5906418 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5906419 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5906420 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5906421 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5906422 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5906423 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5906424 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5906425 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5906426 who are open to doing something on the production side
5906427 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5906428 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5906429 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5906430 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5906431 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5906432 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5906433 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5906434 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5906435 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5906436 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5906437 everybody thinks it can never happen to them you never think someone you know that was such a good person something like that would happen
5906438 i did not know the victim i just saw her on the balcony early in the evening i drove around until i thought she was asleep
5906439 it always answers more questions when something like this happens
5906440 for her family it has to be a tough time to go through
5906441 we will achieve this through tight control of expenses targeted and tailored marketing investment and ensuring an inventory balance consistent with sales
5906442 against a backdrop of flat to negative economic outlook for retail for the first half at least we are focussed on ensuring the business is trading at peak performance and ready to capitalise on the eventual upturn in activity
5906443 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5906444 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5906445 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5906446 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5906447 id rather vote for the devil i know than the devil i dont know

5906602 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5906603 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent
5906604 that seems a more effective strategy than current market expectations of two consecutive 0 25 per cent moves
5906605 predominately its the miners dragging us up and the banks still lagging

5906634 the position of the government is very clear we will not support nuclear power in australia because we dont need to mr ferguson said to abc radio
5906635 as a person who actually encouraged the development of our uranium mining industry i understand the importance of nuclear power beyond australia
5906636 but unlike australia a lot of those countries are not energy rich
5906637 for example just 1 per cent of australias geothermal energy could equate to 26 000 times australias total energy consumption at any one time
5906638 so from the australian governments point of view encouragement of geothermal activity is exceptionally important
5906639 i would have thought that given our renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020 we could see a significant contribution of that 20 per cent from the geothermal industry
5906640 the russian federation will not be able to support it
5906641 the territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders

5906643 it has been several days since the agreement was signed and we dont see any signs of significant russian withdrawal that is the point of this resolution

5906658 its been demonstrated that having viral videos to get people involved in things that were traditionally thought of as wonky inside the beltway issues turned out to be very effective

5906677 it rained the first holes but turned into ideal golf weather at least for me 65 70 and overcast before the sun eventually started to break through it rained all night so that lengthened the course since the roll wasnt there but the greens were pretty good considering i almost had a hole in one with a 7 iron from 160 yards it was pin seeking the entire way but popped right over the pin but i missed the birdie putt so that took away the sweetness of the initial shot
5906678 as a team were really looking forward to playing our 36 hole qualifier at tokatee before the osu event
5906679 its also nice to be done with summer so i can switch focus to the upcoming fall season i felt pretty good the past few months except maybe that i didnt play in as many tourneys as i would have liked the stroke play win was nice in that it helped me remember how it is to win and what takes hole by hole ive also got a chance to work a lot on my short game recently which was important

5906706 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5906707 we are worried the fcc will buckle and allow white space to be used by personal portable devices seeking wireless services
5906708 the radio frequency environment is going to become more crowded and more difficult to use
5906709 in that case the number of wireless microphones used will be reduced significantly and it cost big productions millions of dollars to redesign what they do
5906710 everybody is not only angry and upset they are very very worried
5906711 from the beginning we have said that no white space device should come to market unless the fcc signs off on it
5906712 we have a limited amount of engineering resources and there are hard costs such as fcc licenses that we have had to get

5906716 in april it was reported that the fbi had been focusing on as many as four suspects
5906717 confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
5906718 i was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this is not spin this is not true
5906719 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
5906720 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
5906721 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
5906722 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators

5906757 because of this trend hotspot operators are turning to other methods to generate revenues
5906758 operators have started bundling hotspot access with other services such as fixed and mobile broadband this way consumers can access hotspots without paying a separate fee and operators can generate some access revenue by bundling the cost of the service into a bigger service package that consumers are willing to purchase

5906782 another victory sort of anaheim related comes from torrance some preservationists who live in the old olmstead districts of torrance contacted the anaheim historical society a few years back asking how anaheim had stopped the bulldozers and developed historical districts while that was done before my time i met with them and plugged them in with some of the people who had been involved these poor people were literally where anaheim was 20 years ago the properties not being scraped by their redevelopment agency were upzoned to encourage private development a driving tour of torrance showed condo construction everywhere with signs on the jobs saying we buy empty lots and old houses makes the blood boil anyway thanks to all those folks who have given save historic old torrance some advice because they are beginning to win the fight for preservation they recently won the life of a little spanish casita kit house at the planning commission level and last night their city council voted to not rehear the case this in an environment where preservation was a joke for years
5906783 he elaborated off the cuff on the success of the mills act and historic preservation programs in anaheim and even asked lisa stipkovich when we would be moving from 3rd to 2nd place in california with the number of mills act agreements he is becoming very conversant about preservation and restoration efforts in anaheim when the lemon water phase 3 project came up for approval he described in detail the significance of these kinds of projects to our neighborhoods
5906784 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5906785 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5906786 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5906787 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5906788 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5906789 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5906790 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5906791 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5906792 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5906793 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5906794 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5906795 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5906796 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5906797 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5906798 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it

5906833 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5906834 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5906835 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5906836 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5906837 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5906838 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5906839 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5906840 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5906841 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5906842 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5906843 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5906844 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5906845 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5906846 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5906847 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5906848 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5906849 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5906850 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5906851 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

5906853 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5906854 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5906855 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5906856 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5906857 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5906858 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5906859 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
5906860 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
5906861 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
5906862 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
5906863 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
5906864 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5906865 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
5906866 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone

5906997 if youre not being persecuted for your christianity then youre doing something wrong
5906998 it starts with the fact that we as conservative christians are taught to see america as our land i mean you guys in europe and the loonies on the east and west coasts think the founding fathers died to bring us religious freedom they so did not they died to give new christianity a place where it could flourish
5906999 see i grew up being taught that catholicism was cult really lots of southern baptists believe catholicism is a cult despite the fact that it is the largest practiced religion in the world
5907000 conservative beliefs do not spread because of ignorance you must understand this conservative beliefs spread because of a need in the conservative church to emphasize that if you are not fighting you are losing the battle for spiritual warfare and until you have been out there battling the forces of evil you dont really understand how every day events can be magnified to fit into a larger picture of a tapestry of events being orchestrated by jesus to lead us on to a higher victory
5907001 the southern baptist church is the largest demonination of any religion in america
5907002 i think its wrong to call bush a radical he doesnt care about conservative economics conservative spending and conservative government he cares about conservative christian spiritual warfare

5907010 lets try to snuff this elections new big theory before it becomes conventional wisdom although its probably too late the subject matter is moral values the theory is this kerry lost because he was very unpopular with people who believe moral values are the most important issues this group of values voters is growing and democrats are doomed until they can win them over while the nexus of issues boiled into the words moral values certainly were a big factor in this election its being exaggerated partly because of the oddities of the poll itself and partly because the big theory conforms with what republican strategists want you to believe
5907011 n october 2001 jamal visited pakistan as a tourist he says he was in quetta on the afghanistan border four days into his trip when the american bombing campaign began
5907012 nine days later while he waited in kandahar for the embassy to transport him home the americans picked him up
5907013 when i met jamal he began to tell me about the more bewildering abuses prostitutes were flown in from the us he doesnt know whether they were there to smear their menstrual blood on the faces of the more devout detainees

5907021 lets face a hard truth this was the bitterest presidential campaign in living memory the democrats and their allies staked everything on the defeat of this president all of the resources they had accumulated over a generation of struggle were thrown into this battle and they have failed despite all of their tricks despite all of their lies the people have rejected them they mean nothing they are worth nothing theres no point in trying to reach out to them because they wont be reached out to weve got their teeth clutching the sidewalk and out boot above their head nows the time to curb stomp the bastards

5907025 in four historic years america has been given great tasks and faced them with strength and courage

5907039 we are pleased that judge bellows ruled in our favor on these questions he ruled very clearly that our congregations are able to rely on the virginia division statute in order to keep our church property we have maintained all along that our churches own trustees hold title for the benefit of their congregations tec and the diocese have never owned any of the properties and their names do not appear on deeds to the property the virginia supreme court has consistently stated that virginia does not recognize denominational trusts of the sort asserted by tec and the diocese
5907040 given todays ruling we hope and pray that tec and the diocese would put away this needless litigation we have consistently remained open to exploring avenues for amicable discussions and have been grieved that tec has chosen to continue to pursue a path of confrontation rather than civil dialogue this litigation has done nothing to spread the good news of jesus christ
5907041 it is expected that the problem will be resolved in the coming days

5907046 the higher areas of mallow town were affected over a period of four days
5907047 it was due to the high level of rainfall or run off from river tributaries theres a system that sets off if there is a threat to water quality it was purely a precautionary measure there was no issue regarding drinking water
5907048 there was a lot of flood water present particularly in fields but slowly and surely they are receding there are no properties under threat and any that were are well defended
5907049 its only a small landslip but its frightening in that it could be a lot worse and they are serious issues

5907057 in the end banning plastic bottles rather than removing toxins from our municipal drinking water shows a tragic level of denial on the part of elected officials not to mention a sad disregard for public health by administration

5907071 im curious why the firefighter hasnt been fired already and ordered to repay the state
5907072 not only do the firefighters receive civil service protection but also union protection that does slow down the process because between the time that a firefighters injured and the time that theres a decision regarding the disability retirement that firefighter is earning 100 percent of his or her salary with no taxes taken out
5907073 this is a firefighter who has risked his life since 1986 for this city
5907074 im curious why the body builder has not been arrested and brought up on insurance fraud charges
5907075 there is a swirl of information that based upon being seen in a body building video that he has somehow committed some fraud regarding his disability nothing could be farther from the truth all that mr arroyo did was attempt to get better

5907125 i think it was her fathers birthday that night when we were on that balcony and she was just sitting there talking about her dad
5907126 so what was my job not to say a lot but to listen to her talk about her dad
5907127 here are a sister and a brother in the olympic village greatest athletes in the world but theyre missing their dad
5907128 didnt do well did bad i did terrible it was devastating
5907129 and before it was over his head was on my shoulder he was crying but he had put his shades on although i knew his pain knew his burden knew his failure he still didnt want me to see him cry
5907130 ive never been in a place where they were so celebrated but under so much pressure
5907131 you were not just representing your school your family or your town you were on a worldwide stage and if they didnt have it together mentally physically and spiritually it would be very tough for them to make it
5907132 believe it or not some of them thats where they got close to god because they realized that this was a dream come true and they could not make it on their own
5907133 it came through a lot of prayer a lot of hard work a lot of times when they could have been injured and they were not and someone else was
5907134 i said the issue is not how many talents they had
5907135 the issue was the head coach knew how much playing time each one of them needed and she gave to them each according to their abilities its the experience that no one else had
5907136 the master was upset with the servant given one talent because he did not do his best with it and i shared that that night

5907142 i took advantage of not just my role but to learn from others
5907143 i took the opportunity to be teachable that olympic experience catapulted me into a whole other arena
5907144 it was a great thing being a chaplain being around the most phenomenal athletes in the whole world
5907145 being a mother has taught me more about the grace of god and my own shortcomings than any other experience in my life i see gods grace every morning as they wake up healthy and strong as they laugh and giggle as they run and play as their minds develop right before my eyes my biggest lesson learned is to cherish every moment with your children they grow too fast god never gives you more than you can handle and i am going to do all that i can for my little ones especially when they face challenges
5907146 true some of the lessons theyve taught me were not very fun as they were happening but the good moments mix up with the not so good moments in a wonderful curriculum ordained for me by god himself
5907147 i honestly can say that being a mother is the most powerful and important feeling in the world
5907148 god gave me strength when i couldnt go on life when my body was trying to shut down encouragement to my broken heart meals when the refrigerator was empty a place to live when ends did not meet peace in the midst of turmoil and a contentment that went beyond my circumstances sure life gets hard now and then my heart may still become anxious and my mind may begin to assume the worse but today i know that contentment comes from within i have learned to be content regardless of my circumstances because god is faithful to me i am so very blessed
5907149 this is the place i come to share my stories thoughts prayers battles struggles and victories as a christian mom

5907181 that was about the same time my mother died and by best friend got killed so it was a really rough year but we survived we made it we had our bicycles that gave us a much needed outlet for energy and to help deal with some of the stress

5907184 they toss out some half truths in an attempt to get people to completely dump the strip basically theyre stretching the truth so they can swipe some of the business johnston has generated

5907195 thats the first one of my buddies ive ever seen die

5907198 its like one of the those movies out of like vietnam that you see with all these special effects and everythings on fire
5907199 smoke in the air and thats all you see is tracer rounds going back and forth
5907200 the way they served each other youre fighting for the guy on your back the guy thats in the foxhole next to you when that kind of stuff happens we all love each other very much
5907201 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares i guess

5907205 the georgian air force and artillery struck the sleeping town at midnight more than 1 500 civilians perished in the first hours of the shelling at the same time georgian special forces shot 10 russian peacekeepers who didnt expect such a betrayal from their georgian colleagues
5907206 does that mean that the u s and nato can use brute force when they want to and russia has to abstain from it even if it has to look at thousands of its own citizens being shot

5907222 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5907223 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5907224 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5907225 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5907226 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5907227 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5907228 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5907229 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5907230 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5907231 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5907232 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5907233 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it
5907234 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5907235 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5907236 when things are going smoothly its easy to run but when you have a defeat or people arent playing its my responsibility to keep these players happy and keep things moving forward

5907248 that is yoshi the voice and living embodiment of dogvillasan coyote god from vietnam
5907249 which means that the true wisdom of the braindead soundmachine is channeled through yoshis earthly carbon capsule the braindead soundmachine is merely a vessel for dogvillasans message
5907250 it speaks a universal language of enlightenment just stick a microphone on yoshi and prepare to be brightened with light and awareness
5907251 west not only tapped into the hubris of this town but how the dream factory creates not just illusion but its logical byproduct disillusionment
5907252 its not that different from the people who make this pie filling
5907253 that must churn out more and more entertainment in order to survive to grow to flourish its insidious nature is such that it has to convince the locusts the consumers that they need to purchase and absorb this stuff in order to make their lives meaningful which was a lie worthy of goebbels who was just beginning to reach his stride in the third reich when the day of the locust was written west was prescient in that he knew that entertainment is merely cultural fascism
5907254 are you telling me that there was little difference between say irving thalberg paramount picture pie filling and the third reich
5907255 the manufacture and distribution of pie filling is the least problematic there is very little difference between what product is coming out of the studios and what propaganda was issued from the politburo or the reichstag after the fire
5907256 but isnt a screenwriter such as yourself equally complicit arent you as evil as say some kraut in a guard tower at dachau
5907257 that is where you are wrong sir it all boils down to self awareness read this book no one in it is exempt from wests wrath but the protagonist slash anti hero tod hackett shows uncanny and astute self awareness that makes him the least dubious character in the entire manuscript
5907258 yes self awareness it makes all the difference tod hackett shows such traits in a painting he calls the burning of los angeles hackett finishes this painting just as locust reaches it d nouement in the form of a holocaust of fire on hollywood boulevard
5907259 so youre saying hacketts self awareness spares him somehow umm i still dont see how self awareness gives any of us an exemption
5907260 of course you dont you do not possess any you are lost in east hollywood and you happen to play guitar the most reductive form of expression since the sex pistols immolated in san francisco in 1978 you have this delusional idea that music is somehow different from the other forms of electronic media that corrupt the sanctity of the human spirit
5907261 do you see the difference of course not because you are truly fucked
5907262 hey great to make your acquaintance im benny mayer and i do marketing and public relations for nitro inc and seeing as how you guys are famous and drag racing fans and everything we would love to do some photo opportunities with you guys maybe we can get you to endorse us in interviews and maybe buy a 55 gallon drum of nitromethane for us as a little quid pro quo
5907263 umm we cant help you with your fuel costs but we can promote your race team as a matter of fact were going to be on a music video show this wednesday give us some spare uniforms and well wear them during the interview perhaps a proper sponsor will see your logo and want to give involved with nitro inc and start cutting you checks for your operating expenses
5907264 oh yes a wop bop a roo rop a rop bam boo
5907265 so yoshi the interviewers are going to ask you some questions that you may not be able to understand
5907266 that foppish narcissistic excuse of a human being on your t shirt
5907267 man you are an unfeeling asshole and buy a clean shirt
5907268 rock and roll is over it is cooked put a bullet in its doddering corpse but spare yourself to snuff yourself under the delusion that you will somehow create this timeless legacy with your music is beyond megalomaniacal

5907322 for sure we definitely wouldnt want to be on the outside and not in i think its big going into our biggest race of the year indy knowing that were all in you cant really relax but there wont be the pressure of having to get in we can go there and race to win the biggest race of the year
5907323 it is you wonder how its all going to shake out because you havent been focusing on performance youve been focusing on safety and building new race cars that are yeah we had a lot of engineering data behind them but until they hit the race track theres always an element of doubt of whether theyre really going to work and what youre going to have to face and deal with in making them work so with all of the things on our minds with safety and really not focusing on performance like we have in the past i would say were in pretty good shape right now
5907324 i guess going out and winning the first race of the year with a brand new car and very little testing on it i guess i started out with quite a bit of confidence which was good we didnt have to struggle for a few races and the next race i went to the final so i guess at the very beginning i was convinced that we could win with what we had and with what we had come up with with all of fords help i mean that was big
5907325 i think its equally as good i dont think were at any disadvantage whatsoever because other teams out there have met the new rules but have not gone as far as we have and they basically have the old style chassis with the bigger diameter and thicker tubing and yet we redesigned the funny car from front to back and weve all won races this year weve all qualified in fact we have more no 1 qualifiers than anybody else so it shows that we didnt hinder performance and weve greatly greatly improved the safety on these things i guarantee you though without fords engineering with niranjan singh and pat dimarco and everybody thats been on this project night and day we wouldnt be where were at without them
5907326 heres how i look at it anybody in the top 10 can win the championship because theres six races left and theres not a big enough spread from no 1 to no 10 for that no 10 guy to be at a big disadvantage so any one of those 10 can win i think weve kind of had the outlook the way this seasons worked of kind of being in test mode because we havent been able to test theres a shortage on nitro and we havent tested in months so weve had to test and race and try to win races while were racing without all of that testing it kind of put us behind yet it got us all in the top 10 so when we get to this countdown there isnt going to be any more testing we need to make sure these cars are right and we have our tune ups right and we just need to go down the race track every time and be in the top two or three cars every single run our focus i think is going to change a little bit when the countdown begins because we dont have the luxury of testing if you fail to qualify if you have a lot of first round losses youre out of it so we need to make sure weve got it together and i believe we all do indy is going to be the same way even though were all in we need to go in there swinging and just know that weve got our tune ups right
5907327 excited and relieved and confident we know we have the best resources here the best people we have everything around us to win and were all in the top 10 so theres no reason if we do our jobs and do what we know how to do that one of these cars cant win the champion ship
5907328 thank you that was definitely a relief and that was definitely our goal going into that last race was try to get into that countdown and fortunately everything worked out in our favor and now we dont have to worry about that when we get to indy
5907329 its a huge accomplishment first of all theres so many funny cars that run so well that theres probably at least 16 or more that i feel legitimately have a chance of getting into that and john and robert and ashley its ashleys second year and shes doing a great job driving theyve got that car running good robert is always a strong contender and john force is always in there so i wouldve expected them to be in that countdown but for me and my team being my first year a rookie driver and having to put a new team together thats tough to do its tough to get the team working together so theyre not making mistakes and me trying to figure out what i need to do and do my job as a driver so for us to be able to get into that top 10 here that first year and into the countdown i think thats quite an accomplishment for a first year team
5907330 you know its really been a rollercoaster year honestly it took us seven races we lost first round every race then we kind of got hot and went to two finals in a row and then we went i think to three finals in five races or something so we were cold we got hot and then we kind of got cold again now were kind of starting to get rolling again so its really been up or down to be honest with you i havent really been able to say ah man weve really got a handle on this you know the other thing thats been a big issue for us and im sure for everyone else is the fact that theres been no testing this team the force team especially theyve done more testing than any other team over the years and i believe thats definitely worked in their favor for success because you have time to work things out and try new stuff and this year like you said weve got the new ford motor got the new chassis its stiffer more weight another 100 pounds on the car so all of that its tough when youre at the races because you just cant try stuff you have to make sure you qualify you cant really take any unnecessary risks so its really tough like i said its not just only been for our team but for all the teams
5907331 yes absolutely if you could win one race in a year it would be indy we feel pretty good about weve made a couple of mistakes here the last few races but overall the cars been running good we qualified third last weekend fifth the weekend before so the things been going down the track threw a cylinder out this last race or i think we wouldve been right there and have a good chance of beating frank hawley and been into another final but yeah were talking about that and what we need to do different and its really a huge thing to be able to have a spot locked into that countdown because indys got so much pressure just being indy the biggest race of the year if you were to throw that countdown scenario in there as well it would really take a toll on the nerves
5907332 i definitely believe in momentum what momentum is as far as drag racing goes the way i perceive it when you start going rounds on sunday and you do that for a couple of races in a row say you go to two or three finals in a row now youre getting more experience at racing on sunday because sunday is a different day than friday or saturday qualifying so it just gives you more runs it gives you more confidence thats the big thing about what momentum does plus you start creating some of your own luck the better you do ive looked at it as far as even being a crew chief because every race starts pretty much at 11 oclock and then the following rounds and so when you get into that groove of okay well do this for the first round because the tracks going to be probably the best of the day and then its going to be a little bit worse second round so well do this third round will probably be a little bit worse so we need to do this and then fourth round it should be getting a little better maybe so well go back to this so the more rounds you go on sunday ive been on teams that have won five races in a row and been to six finals in a row and when you get into that groove on sunday the crew is getting used to going rounds and theyre up to speed and you take a team that hasnt been to a final its a tough day to go four rounds with a group thats not used to going four rounds

5907340 the slowdown in the growth rate of the index can be mainly attributed to the sharp fall in the share market tighter liquidity as represented by money supply weak dwelling approvals and softer data for us industrial production
5907341 with rates well into the contractionary zone and global liquidity conditions deteriorating there is a strong case for a larger first cut of 0 5 per cent

5907349 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5907350 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5907351 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5907352 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5907353 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5907354 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5907355 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5907356 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5907357 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5907358 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5907359 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5907360 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people

5907367 brambles remains confident that an agreement will be reached with wal mart to deliver the lowest cost overall supply chain solution
5907368 the decision to shut down tatv was very difficult for us to make
5907369 we evaluated several different possible strategies before reaching this decision however the growing market share of classified ads using the free internet model coupled with the fact that classified ads are not one of our companys core businesses forced us to close the division
5907370 we thank the employees of tatv for their many years of dedication

5907377 it is indeed an unfortunate development and we extend our full support to jade in this difficult hour she is a strong willed woman who has emerged victorious from many battles we sincerely hope she wins this time as well
5907378 life is so unpredictable and can so easily distract and derail you from your plans
5907379 deleveraging of the company including partial sales of the companys holdings in copenhagen and brussels airports
5907380 whilst this is primarily a consequence of external factors beyond maps control action has nonetheless been taken to address this security price underperformance she said
5907381 feedback from our active program of engagement with investors has highlighted a changed attitude towards acceptable levels of leverage
5907382 boards and management are also seeking to address the gap between the current security price and the security value implied by directors valuations reaffirm the quality and sustainability of distributions and reinforce maps commitment to its traditional investment discipline
5907383 proportionate ebitda growth of 9 6 per cent in the face of the current external environment represents an excellent achievement and demonstrates the significant value which has been generated by the aeronautical and commercial initiatives map has underway at our airports
5907384 we recognise that our airline customers face challenging conditions but the first half result is evidence of the importance of investing in airports with attractive characteristics and opportunities across the aviation and commercial businesses
5907385 whilst our financial position is very sound we recognise that attitudes towards leverage have changed if not permanently then for the foreseeable future
5907386 consequently we are applying our surplus cash to the repayment of our hybrid capital instrument tickets which will simplify maps capital structure
5907387 whilst there is no provision for early redemption we are offering tickets holders a withdrawal option with any remaining balance to be defeased and repaid on 1 january 2010
5907388 the discount to valuation which the current security price represents remains near record levels
5907389 a buyback of this scale also aids the quality and sustainability of our distributions and our commitment to achieve broad convergence between our regular distribution and proportionate earnings by 2010
5907390 conducted at prices that reflect our full directors valuations generating substantial premia to the prices for maps original investment of 49 per cent for copenhagen and 47 per cent for brussels
5907391 importantly map will exercise joint control over both investments whilst retaining exposure to their future growth
5907392 asur meets maps key investment criteria and we expect the returns from this investment to be well above that offered by current and proposed major airport privatisations
5907393 we believe this investment demonstrates maps continued ability to source attractive growth opportunities
5907394 a continuation of the current market conditions would again impact our revenues and profitability in 2009
5907395 our environment has a defining influence on the performance of our business and we were clearly not immune to these market forces in 2008
5907396 as fellow shareholders we are disappointed this years results have not been consistent with previous results which delivered total returns for our shareholders in excess of 30 per cent per annum in the decade up to 2007
5907397 firstly we must continue to invest in our strategic priorities
5907398 secondly we must maintain our conviction for the way we manage money

5907401 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded since january 1 2006
5907402 these include deaths both in the control and intervention groups
5907403 after a faculty review meeting of all available data we found that none of the deaths can be attributed to drugs
5907404 as the clinical trial market is increasing in india we have stipulated a separate provision in the bill to ensure that best practices are followed while conducting trials earlier we had guidelines on how trials need to be conducted soon we will have a law
5907405 no trials can be conducted without permission from the drugs controller general the provisions are presently being studied by the parliamentary standing committee once it approves and returns the bill we will place it again before parliament
5907406 their position i dont understand the icc has determined that pakistan is safe they have various sources to judge the security measures in place
5907407 if cricket australia has other security information which is negative why dont they share it with us why dont they make us wise they have not told us of any concerns they have been dealing with the icc how come they are not willing to trust the icc where are they getting their security information from they wont tell us their security information is dubious
5907408 there are also particular interpretations different organisations will make of the information
5907409 the change may mean more assessments of the situation but time is running out to stage the event or move it elsewhere
5907410 weve discussed this with the experts who acknowledge that westerners are targets in pakistan whereas the biggest danger in sri lanka appears to be collateral damage
5907411 for small independent owners and operators it means theyre just hauled with other independent owners theres no real information available to consumers
5907412 what grocery watch will do is give those people who have got access to the internet and a computer basic prices that are up to a month old it wont give you any information about discounts it put the prices of the so called basket of goods into a very large region
5907413 what mr rudds trying to do is give australians a pair of binoculars and then tell them to watch the price of groceries
5907414 the best thing in terms of prices is to make sure that we have effective competition that we do everything we possibly can to support independent owners and operators
5907415 almost all of northern luzon is experiencing the fury of karen
5907416 we are prepared we are not just looking at rain and strong winds we are also looking at storm surges and strong waves in coastal areas
5907417 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5907418 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5907419 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5907420 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5907421 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5907422 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5907423 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5907424 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it
5907425 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5907426 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5907427 when things are going smoothly its easy to run but when you have a defeat or people arent playing its my responsibility to keep these players happy and keep things moving forward
5907428 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5907429 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5907430 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5907431 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children
5907432 they immediately encountered extreme fire and heat conditions and they turned back and launched an external attack

5907443 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced
5907444 had the stage to themselves last week while obama vacationed
5907445 could wait until the republican convention to distract attention from george bush and dick cheney the first nights speakers
5907446 its a message of independence it brings back the maverick john mccain it solidifies his image with independent voters
5907447 had the stage to themselves last week while obama vacationed
5907448 obama put out a tongue in cheek response to senator mccains celebrity ad
5907449 the ad also features six different shots of senator mccain next to president bush
5907450 now it frequently seems respect takes a backseat to ridicule
5907451 mccains web site is still playing catch up to obamas use of cyberspace
5907452 youve got better things to do im not the guy
5907453 you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy

5907467 either by australians or more likely by foreign investors who capture the economic benefit the only real boost to australian economic welfare comes from the tax collected and thats much less
5907468 this isnt a debate about interpretation its an error by the productivity commission it created four hundred million dollars out of thin air
5907469 i actually get negative benefits a cost to the economy ranging from 14 million per year to 92 million but these are tiny numbers in the context of the economy so its best to conclude that the net welfare effect is roughly zero
5907470 this has happened before in 1997 the commission as desperately keen to show that cuts in car tariffs would boost economic welfare and it also misinterpreted the models results
5907471 i dont mind people making mistakes but if they dont want acknowledge that or if they say it doesnt matter they are abandoning an evidence base
5907472 there were no injuries both rooms were evacuated quickly and they have other places to stay tonight
5907473 we were just about as skinny as we could get last night
5907474 but we were able to handle it and i would tell you that we were pretty fortunate
5907475 simultaneously we have more power pole fires and trees fires that were gong on
5907476 again at the same time because all of our response was at eagle transfer for the entire city we called back our personnel they came back and manned the stations so they were the ones responding to those fires
5907477 the guys that ended up responding monday night that we called back is the shift thats at work today
5907478 so theyre real tired today but we need everybody to understand that rest assured well be there

5907495 one of the reasons were so good about it is because we get so many of these down in las vegas

5907503 why so shy show your companion show her your true self
5907504 nothing since the first one hes with the doctor though so i guess its expected
5907505 as soon as hes able im sure jackll be in contact
5907506 we both know thats not true captain harkness has been missing for nearly six weeks
5907507 im afraid that i dont know what you mean surely wed be the first to be aware if captain harkness was missing
5907508 you really dont expect me to believe that do you mr jones
5907509 your dear captain disappeared after that nasty business with the rift last month and youve seen nothing of him since no one has not torchwood two whitehall or even my office granted im still new to the job but no one here at downing street can remember talking to him in a very long time
5907510 as you said yourself prime minister we had a significant problem here in cardiff with the rift
5907511 as such there have been intensive clean up operations headed by captain harkness
5907512 you heard me perfectly well mr jones i dont believe you
5907513 im sorry that you dont believe me sir but im telling the truth
5907514 then why am i looking at intel that shows him in the himalayas with torchwood number one enemy
5907515 your intel must be incorrect sir because captain harkness is not in that region of the world
5907516 certainly not prime minister i am merely informing you that our intel on the subject is contradictory to yours and begging your pardon sir as captain harkness is in charge of torchwood three we do tend to keep very close tabs on his whereabouts
5907517 captain harkness is outside of cardiff yes but we are fully aware of his location and it is not the himalayas
5907518 im sorry mr jones but i dont share you conviction
5907519 and as harkness is possibly in the company of such a notorious individual i feel that it is necessary for the safety of the nation that you and your little group travel to tibet and investigate the sighting
5907520 you can send whomever you like but it wont be anyone from torchwood three
5907521 with all due respect sir we are not answerable to you your office is certainly welcome to voice its concerns to us but it is torchwood alone that will decide whether the matter deserves our attention in this case as we know that captain harkness is not in the himalayas we will not follow up on your intel good afternoon prime minister
5907522 youve got a bigger pair than i gave you credit for jonesy
5907523 we know that jack is with the doctor theres no point in going on a wild goose chase
5907524 none of us have ever met the doctor and what the reports say
5907525 back in 2006 when that space pig crashed into big ben they needed someone to examine the body the doctor was there hes brilliant and not a danger from what i could tell he tried to help
5907526 hes the one who stopped the massacre at canary wharf
5907527 considering what happened when we went to the countryside i dont much fancy wandering around a mountain when we know jacks not there
5907528 jack youre all over the news whats going on where are you
5907529 well well well if it isnt captain jack harkness just the man i was looking for and youre on the phone with torchwood even better
5907530 harold saxon got on the line suddenly and jack started to panic
5907531 if we do that well lose most of our power well just be sitting here in the dark waiting until its all over we wont be able to help jack
5907532 dont put too much pressure on it or youll get stuck
5907533 its like a time bubble a lock anything that tries to move through there will get stick in time nothing can get in and we can still keep the computers and everything running
5907534 all the way around the hub right down to the lowest levels even the ones not on the blueprints
5907535 ive been working on this for about three years now this is the first time ive been able to use it full scale
5907536 saxon gets elected and all of sudden aliens are making contact
5907537 doesnt stay dead for long i get to kill him again
5907538 he told me that this would take me somewhere safe
5907539 he said youd do that act like nothing is wrong even though inside youre in an absolute panic
5907540 jack told me that whatever happens i should trust you the most
5907541 so how exactly are you meant to travel all over the world to tell this story the doctor told you to
5907542 he called it a vortex manipulator we used it to travel from the year one hundred trillion back to the present it can also be used as a teleport
5907543 im not going to stay cooped up in here while all of this is happening i have to do something
5907544 its better if theres only two of us the more people there are the harder itll be to stay invisible since i only have two of these
5907545 i would be a better choice to go than ianto i was a police officer im better at dealing with people besides he has no field training
5907546 id actually prefer to go with ianto jack told me to trust him and given everything thats going on out there im going to listen to jack
5907547 after what happened at the beacons jack made sure of it who do you think is always going weevil hunting with him
5907548 there really isnt much choice we cant let martha go on her own youre more at home with technology theres no point in sending owen because that would leave whoever stays in the hub without a medic and if gwen went martha would probably ditch her somewhere outside germany this is the best way
5907549 its just going to be so strange seeing you in something other than a suit
5907550 when this is over im taking you out for lunch and youll see me in something other than a suit

5907556 thanks for the great list this post is most defiantly
5907557 welcome home mark i cant wait to hear all about
5907558 when one nuclear bomb could destroy a city like denver we dont need 6 000
5907559 i dont know if it will make people more nervous it does get a valid point across in raising awareness but im not sure if it does it in the right way it employs the tactics of fear the policy of which is employed so often in politics that it just gets a little bit repetitive
5907560 we received several complaints from customers and employees on the content of this ad and erred on the side of avoiding objectionable content the airport is a place where people of all political persuasions come for business and pleasure and we wanted to avoid any issues related to what was perceived as a political message
5907561 no one is going to get hurt by the photograph or the message were hoping to basically bring the message into peoples consciousness so they think about it and realize that its a major threat to the planet and we need to do something about it
5907562 what would happen if an instance of animal abuse wasnt noticed and the social worker ended up being cited for something they didnt notice
5907563 our hearts go out to animals and we all want to do our role but i think these are the kinds of questions that need to be considered
5907564 u s markets generally do well in an election year particularly in the second half and it looks like the trend is continuing
5907565 the u s economy is faster moving than european economies the statistics get released faster and the policy response is quicker
5907566 in terms of all the indicators we are seeing the u s is in a recession the payroll figures show rising unemployment corporate profits are down and the housing market is falling all the drivers of the initial economic weakness are still present
5907567 consumer spending is key to how quickly the economy bounces back everyone has predicted a downturn yet it hasnt slowed down dramatically even now
5907568 oil drove inflation on the way up and as it comes down it will have a lagging effect
5907569 the u s market has tended to be a difficult sell and people have been right to be underweight largely because of worries over the quality of profits and the weakness in the dollar these factors are fading away
5907570 thanks for the great list this post is most defiantly
5907571 welcome home mark i cant wait to hear all about
5907572 the doctor amp donna show up outside the watch house for some reason the interest canon powershot also jumped out at me
5907573 well new to us anyway wizards found it buried in the cellars of the university and decided to donate it to us thought it might come in handy for us with protecting the city
5907574 nobby stop chattering and give us a hand will you
5907575 oops id better be off dont want to get on anguas bad side wrong time of the month and all
5907576 thats corporal nobbs miss hes human got a certificate signed by the patrician and everything
5907577 excuse me but should you really be testing that here um whats your name
5907578 oh im captain carrot maam it should be perfectly safe
5907579 this building is due to be torn down as part of a revitalisation scheme in the area perfect opportunity to test the powershot
5907580 i mean its a stonking great cannon right with the added oomph of powershot thrown in for the heck of it strikes me that you could do more damage than planned if youre not careful
5907581 what what have willies got to do with bloody stupid inventions
5907582 no no no thats his name well no his name is actually bergholt stuttley johnson but everyone knows him as bloody stupid johnson bit of a misnomer really given that the man was a complete and utter genius of sorts i mean the things he came up with fantastic creations that could even astound the time lords and it takes a lot to impress a time lord like that believe me i met him once must have been in my third no fourth incarnation and he was
5907583 im loving the history lesson here doctor but is there a point
5907584 well yes the point is that mr johnsons inventions never actually did what they were supposed to do had a real problem following any kind of design specification so what he set out to build ended up being something completely different and unpredictable
5907585 well theres an organ up at the university that can cause the entire building to move on its foundations by several inches and trigger acute bowel discomfort in a large chunk of the surrounding population not pleasant that trust me
5907586 what so that thing isnt actually going to blow anything up
5907587 unlikely probably end up being ooooh i dont know a decorative fountain
5907588 well if its useless as a cannon then why are they bothering
5907589 they havent worked out its a bloody stupid johnson creation i expect the wizards were having a clearout saw something cannon shaped and decided that foisting it off on the watch would be the easiest way to get rid of it
5907590 theyre wizards though wise men right surely theyd try to find out what it was and if it was safe before they handed it over
5907591 not exactly bit of a mad bunch wizards on the disc actually very mad in the case of professor dinwiddie i think hes the bursar right now actually might be worth popping in and visiting him for some entertainment
5907592 right yes the wizards unreliable lot except for the librarian top orangutan that librarian certainly got the brains and the common sense among that lot the rest bunch of lazy bumbling old men who dont really have any clue what theyre doing though they do have an uncanny ability to get themselves into all kinds of dire situations
5907593 i expect you graduated top of the class in how to successfully and repeatedly get yourself into dire situations
5907594 but but they put giant sodding cannon balls in that things made from iron where did all this crud come from
5907595 quite a few of his inventions managed to even break the laws of physics bloody brilliant that man
5907596 decorative fountain he says i wouldnt worry about it donna he says sometimes doctor you are an utter numpty
5907597 and really the gunk is very pretty id say that counted as decorative
5907598 surgery was always the last resort but unfortunately thats what it came down to

5907817 bila umatku hadiri suatu majelis jangan sekali kali tinggalkan majelis sebelum tiga kali baca doa artinya maha suci engkau wahai allah dengan segala puji bagi mu aku bersaksi bahwa tiada tuhan selain engkau ampunilah dosa dosaku dan terimalah taubatku jika majelis itu banyak kebaikan doa tadi menyegelkan kebaikan jika majelis itu banyak keburukan doa tadi jadi penghapus dosa dosa selama di dalam majelis
5907818 kenapa engkau temui seorang fasiq yang tenggelam dalam minuman haram menilik cahaya wajahmu tentulah kau ini termasuk orang shalih
5907819 engkau berangkat dari tempat teramat jauh dan bersusah payah jalan hingga tempat ini hendak lihat tetanggamu kelak di surga berhasil bertemu engkau malah balik tanpa mengucap salam tanpa ada pembicaraan dan tanpa ada perjumpaan
5907820 ya abu yazid engkau tidak perlu bingung kenapa aku bisa mengetahui kedatanganmu tak ada yang mencengangkan dzat yang gerakkan dirimu datang ke sini telah beri tahu diriku mari masuk dan duduklah bersama kami barang sebentar
5907821 tidakkah kau tahu masuk surga itu berombongan di sini dulu ada delapan puluh orang yang gemar reguk khamr aku bimbing mereka lalu empat puluh orang telah bertaubat tinggalkan kefasiqan ini mereka itulah teman temanku kelak di surga kini tinggal empat puluh orang belum keluar dari kegemaran fasiq itu wahai tetanggaku di surga kelak karena kau telah hadir di sini giliran tugasmu bimbing mereka tercegah dari berbuat fasiq
5907822 i liked that dvw provided much needed solutions to consumers dryer and dryer vent problems which ultimately prevents dryer fires
5907823 when consumers find their dryer taking more than one cycle to dry a load they assume its mechanical when the real problem is lint accumulation in the dryer vent causing the dryer to work inefficiently and become susceptible to a dryer fire
5907824 will create a safe environment in their home prolong the life of their dryer and save money on energy bills

5907830 no s lo sobre el derecho vasco sino tambi n sobre el de otros pueblos como escoceses o flamencos
5907831 es inaceptable desde el punto de vista democr tico que una sola persona y con un solo argumento se posicione en contra de todo un parlamento que representa a la sociedad vasca

5907838 suficientes indicios de que los golpes producidos intencionadamente por el imputado antonio puertas causaron el hematoma subtural
5907839 no se puede admitir que el agresor ignorase las peligrosas consecuencias de los golpes propiciados el agresor tuvo nimo de causar graves lesiones e incluso asumiendo la eventual muerte del agredido como consecuencia de stas
5907840 el retraso en apreciar el verdadero alcance de las lesiones y su tratamiento puede dar lugar a la responsabilidad que en su caso se depure en la correspondiente sede incluso penalmente

5907859 schaus has reached the goal of making wsu one of the most competitive programs in the missouri valley conference a fact highlighted by wsus four straight mvc all sports trophies the four straight awards were highlighted by a wsu record seven conference titles in 2005 06 as well as 20 valley team titles in the last four years
5907860 in addition all wichita state sports that sell tickets were ranked nationally in attendance during the past two years which is undoubtedly a direct result of schaus efforts to upgrade institutional athletics facilities
5907861 in order to create a solid foundation in his first year
5907862 schaus restructured the wsu athletics department in an effort to create a business like atmosphere and in the process hired five head coaches and five new administrators
5907863 i would rather see the cuts cause we spent too much money on the frivolous things and theres a lot of people and places that we dont need them there
5907864 i think its a short term fix for a long term problem because you know a stat is only as good as the education of its citizens to begin with so cutting educational fundings not going to help anyone
5907865 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5907866 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5907867 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5907868 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen
5907869 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5907870 this community art project reflects a culture in which we are obsessed with celebrities

5907877 according to a press release issued by petroleos de venezuela s a pdvsa pdvsa will proceed to take operational control of the plants of cemex venezuela
5907878 the mexican government has formally informed venezuela of its support for the companys request to continue negotiations
5907879 continue negotiations based on the principles of dialogue non discrimination compromise and openness
5907880 i think there is still room for negotiation we are not at the point of no return
5907881 the cemex case is very complicated but the numbers which we are using for it are close to the governments offer
5907882 at sidor production has fallen some 25 percent neither has there been progress in the belt
5907883 i thought the last two days theyve been practicing very well ive been very pleased with all three of them
5907884 i think jordan just has to play within the offense
5907885 i think we have enough weapons around him that if he just does that hell be fine and really whoever the quarterback is thats what he has to do make the plays that are available if we just do that well be fine
5907886 weve had two good scrimmages and its a senior team
5907887 i like the way were working we just have to get people well and get ready to play
5907888 i dont know yet theres still so much newness and exploration that i dont feel like im at home ask me in november and then ill have a better answer
5907889 we regret that jmu has left us no choice but litigation
5907890 will be the final leg of the political race this year
5907891 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
5907892 being the last time at home it pulls on you pretty hard
5907893 it was the last mens relay team at ohio university to compete at a home meet and ending it on top it doesnt get any better than that
5907894 we had three regional qualifiers in the throws today which is good to see any time you hit those kinds of marks you know youre doing the right things
5907895 ill raise you everything that was ever posted on the human weapon forum
5907896 the human weapon forum doesnt really count as much as they are just parroting what is heard on the tv they arent original thoughts
5907897 oh trust me dude there are some legitimate expletive on there spouting nonsense thats impossible to decipher from where it came from ive had an account since the beginning and ive viewed all seventy five pages of this expletive
5907898 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5907899 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5907900 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
5907901 the home buying public is going to have to pay
5907902 to stay competitive in the market and take steps to preserve market share
5907903 to look at the evidence and go away unconvinced is one thing
5907904 to not look at the evidence and be convinced against it is another that is not science
5907905 it is possible that we are observing the effects of a new or as yet undiscovered energy source
5907906 plants from crop circles display anatomical alterations which cannot be explained by assuming the formations are hoaxes
5907907 after exhaustive inquiry there is no mundane explanation for the glaze
5907908 highly organized intelligent patterns are not something that could be created by a force of nature
5907909 natural phenomena make mountain ranges and form continents they dont learn geometry in ten years
5907910 in short i believe that our present knowledge provides no explanation
5907911 that is why the hoax hypothesis has been popularly advocated
5907912 people dont want to face up to this and scientists have to deal with the ridicule factor
5907913 bright fluorescent flying light objects sized somewhere between an egg and a football
5907914 title ix is an equal opportunity statute not an equal result statute
5907915 i feel very confident that we have not violated any federal law
5907916 our decision remains final and it was obviously a very difficult decision to have to recommend and make
5907917 if eia wins its suit then the cuts here at ou would be illegal
5907918 so our plan could save the university some headaches down the road
5907919 sit on the sidelines and defer the cuts or be a defendant
5907920 winning the second national championship that i ran in was it was more exciting than the first because i had left my shoes in the hotel that i was staying in
5907921 one of my best friends lent me his shoes and i ran the race in those
5907922 i think back on my years at ou and in 23 years i bet i couldnt come up with five kids that i had trouble with
5907923 thats a small number when you compare the amount of kids on a track team
5907924 i think my biggest accomplishment was being a good positive teacher and coach and a big influence on the student athletes
5907925 im real proud with how the alums that i coached turned out
5907926 it helped me immensely for the training i did and to grow as an individual it made me a better human being
5907927 i had an easier time meeting people so it made it easier for me to talk to people and just to be more aggressive in life
5907928 being able to compete with the ohio colors on was just great it just made college so much more worthwhile
5907929 the greatest thing to happen to me was going to ou it was not my first pick back in those days and im glad i did
5907930 i learned a lot about coaching and then to come back and coach at ohio was just the greatest thing
5907931 a independ ncia chega a tal ponto que as mulheres n o querem misturar suas coisas
5907932 j pensei se n o estou sendo exigente demais mas se tiver que abrir m o do que gosto para ficar com algu m prefiro ficar do jeito que estou
5907933 e como estou de bem com minha solteirice n o me contento com o primeiro que aparece
5907934 um conflito que percebo que as mulheres desejam uma independ ncia lutam por ela e quando pensam em relacionamentos ou est o competindo ou ainda sonham com o homem ideal
5907935 isso na minha opini o desculpa para quem quer continuar solteiro
5907936 with all of the mixed messages we hear about biofuels there is a clear need for a standard that can differentiate the good from the bad for an issue of such seminal importance it was necessary to bring many different stakeholder groups together to agree on how to define and measure sustainable biofuels
5907937 we have done a great job considering the adversity we have had to face both physically and mentally
5907938 even though this is my last year it is still rough to think about the rest of the guys that arent going to be able to run next year
5907939 you have to put that aside at a certain point because you cant let your anger get the best of you
5907940 you still have to relax and throw run and jump the best that you can
5907941 it is sad to see that this is going to be the last chance to do this
5907942 it really says a lot that we have been able to put all of that behind us
5907943 this is one of the best teams that we have ever had and i want everybody to see that it just sucks that this is the last year that anybody is going to see us again
5907944 hopefully people remember us for doing it right and finishing in the end despite all of the things that happened
5907945 no matter what we were able to finish and finish correctly
5907946 no person in the united states shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance
5907947 i feel for my teammates this is an awful situation
5907948 i wouldnt think of transferring im staying because i love ohio university i have so much pride in my school thats why this decision is so hard to take its such small change to fund our program we dont get the special steak dinners like the football and basketball teams
5907949 title ix encourages participation and in no way requires or even suggests that programs be cut
5907950 the best answer is to use resources more wisely so that more students can participate not fewer athletic departments need to learn how to balance their budgets
5907951 the first sign that there were serious financial issues came three or four years ago when mens track and field and mens swimming and diving were de emphasized
5907952 that was one of the first mandates i received when i was hired to be fiscally responsible i had to make a decision that benefited the entire athletic department while at the same time i knew it would affect student athletes when you look at these young athletes and see the hurt and disappointment that hurts
5907953 it still gets back to the quality of experience were providing
5907954 was our current track and field budget where it needed to be no was our current swimming and diving budget where it needed to be no it was going to take a significant investment in those programs to have the success we expect its not healthy working this way
5907955 the university gets a lot of bang for its buck with track and field weve already been cut scholarship wise we never thought it would come to this track and field in the mac is just getting slain
5907956 it doesnt make sense when you look at the big picture
5907957 this cuts off the history of a successful program and successful kids im not going to go away im going to start a campaign the issue is simple its about money the university has a desire to go big time in football were trying to become the boise state of the mac
5907958 ohio university has made a commitment to be successful in all 16 sports and football is one of them
5907959 it begins with hiring quality coaches we have invested in our football program
5907960 kirby walked into this management problem and now has to try and solve it i believe they had no other choice
5907961 at minnesota football mens hockey and mens basketball are the only sports that pay for themselves if this were a business instead of a college the university of minnesota wouldnt be here
5907962 i remember seeing us lose to central michigan 62 0 in wrestling
5907963 that was absolutely awful we had two scholarships was that a quality experience we just couldnt continue like that
5907964 it makes no sense to me they say well still have cross country but what good high school runner is going to come here for cross country knowing there is no indoor or outdoor team
5907965 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself i vividly recall prospective buyers telling us its not even a game while showing us the door
5907966 from sudden complications stemming from his june atv accident on his farm near charlottesville virginia
5907967 so far our voices and suggestions have been tossed aside however we have not yet begun to fight
5907968 all agreed that these cuts were not necessary to comply with title ix and that the university used title ix as a scapegoat
5907969 as a member of eia i work with other eia members to strategize and organize ways in which we can save our teams
5907970 i joined eia because they had already started in the battle to save programs at jmu john marshall university in virginia and they have the experience and know how when dealing with title ix situations like the one we have here at ou
5907971 i realize that this has been a tough situation for all parties involved
5907972 however the decision to cut four sports was a terrible decision
5907973 these cuts if they stand will have a far more negative affect on this institution than i think the administration realizes
5907974 this has caused student moral to go down and this then affects student retention and new student recruitment
5907975 i dont think that it was correctly gone about by the administration
5907976 i think it was very hidden in their agenda and they didnt truly consider the feelings of the athletes theyd be affecting
5907977 we have given many suggestions on how ou can do this with a positive outcome for both the university and the students affected
5907978 we love ou and we dont want ou to get trashed all over his however we are fighting because we want to stay here
5907979 we want to go about this as professionally and politely as possible but if it cannot be done that way then unfortunately it will most likely have to go to litigation
5907980 even members of ous board of trustees privately have expressed the concern that ou did not handle these cuts well procedurally and now eia gl has raised significant substantive questions as well
5907981 and its great lakes chapters intent to file a similar lawsuit over the ou cuts
5907982 equal athletic participation based on enrollment with no need to assess either genders interest
5907983 for a school ostensibly acting in part to save money and in part to comply with title ix going through with the planned cuts will not achieve either goal
5907984 eias fight is with the department of education and not with ou
5907985 we do have a problem with their cuts however we see the predicament that they are finding themselves in
5907986 we will not reverse the decision it is consistent with the law and good public policy

5908021 it all boils down to title ix for this sport
5908022 when you get down to it this is a financial issue
5908023 if title ix was not an issue we would have still been in a position to discontinue athletic programs because of the financial state of our department
5908024 is the financial savings on the elimination of mens track and field significant no its not
5908025 but the financial investment required was going to be very significant to get mens track and field to a level where it needed to be
5908026 i have been told it is going to improve and that is something we certainly expect to happen

5908127 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5908128 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5908129 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002

5908203 the dirty part is the washing of the gourds the crafting of the gourds and the drying finishing of the gourds
5908204 a gourd as i recall is a member of the cucumber family similar in some ways to a squash or a pumpkin but unique in that you can tear their guts out and shellac them and paint them and spray them and turn them into things like this
5908205 we had mike washing out some gourds which is a good shot of him cleaning getting in the water all the gourd guts flying out
5908206 we had him actually create his own gourd design by himself
5908207 once you tear them apart and start doing stuff you get sticky ive got stuff on my boots im not sure i can identify

5908233 it was reported that vmware signed an agreement to participate in the
5908234 let me first say upfront that pulau pisang belongs to malaysia we have never disputed malaysias sovereignity over pulau pisang but our maritime port authority however has a right to operate the lighthouse there and the plot of land on which the lighthouse stands as well as the roadway leading to the lighthouse was granted in perpetuity to singapore so long as singapore operates the lighthouse this was in an indenture between the johor sultan and the straits settlements government in 1900 and we became successor to that
5908235 so we never contested the sovereignity of pulau pisang i might add that in 1968 malaysia objected to the flying of our flag over the lighthouse and we took it out
5908236 the candidates want to stoke the speculation with nods hints and winks to get as much visibility as they can for the ultimate announcement
5908237 its highly unlikely any of those choices are going to decisively impact the election
5908238 it could make a difference at the margins but the choice is much more about governing
5908239 its getting ugly out there the frauds bunglers liars and losers who are hurting america

5908250 true communication is possible only between equals because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth a central tenet of discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically the effect of the s n a f u principle is a progressive disconnection of decision makers from reality
5908251 the fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt

5908256 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
5908257 the venerable biblical tradition of sacred scripture known as the old testament displays a series of divine appellations among which is the sacred name of god revealed in a tetragrammaton yhwh hwhw
5908258 the greek translation of the old testament the so called septuagint dating back to the last centuries prior to the christian era had regularly rendered the hebrew tetragrammaton with the greek word kyrios which means lord since the text of the septuagint constituted the bible of the first generation of greek speaking christians in which language all the books of the new testament were also written these christians too from the beginning never pronounced the divine tetragrammaton
5908259 when in fact st paul with regard to the crucifixion writes that god has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name
5908260 the attribution of this title to the risen christ corresponds exactly to the proclamation of his divinity
5908261 the title in fact becomes interchangeable between the god of israel and the messiah of the christian faith even though it is not in fact one of the titles used for the messiah of israel

5908264 faith must continuously face the challenges of thought in this epoch so that it does not seem a sort of irrational legend that we keep alive but that which really is a response to the great questions not merely a habit but the truth

5908266 wonderful concoction a fruit of our thought and this is why it is universal and for this reason can be communicated to all
5908267 i did once say that to me art and the saints are the greatest apologetic for our faith
5908268 the arguments contributed by reason are unquestionably important and indispensable but then there is always dissent somewhere
5908269 on the other hand if we look at the saints this great luminous trail on which god passed through history we see that there truly is a force of good that resists the millennia likewise if we contemplate the beauties created by faith they are simply i would say the living proof of faith

5908406 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5908407 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5908421 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5908442 ive been sailing back from port stephens and came in late last night and came in to a strange sucking sound on the bottom of the boat
5908443 it sounds like someone with a great vacuum cleaner trying to suck the bottom of the boat
5908444 but i realise now the whale must be sick or something its sort of limp
5908445 our veterinarians and our animal care teams immediately went to work to try and save the animal
5908446 they were not necessarily optimistic at first just because she was in such a dire condition

5908472 the major factor holding back the growth of digital signage at this point is that its effectiveness isnt proven
5908473 but new studies by the nielsen co and others are trying to correlate product sales with the exposure people have to all these advertising screens
5908474 we control 150 different digital sign networks around the world and we know what content and what ads are being run on them at any time
5908475 our developers create an ad then log into the broadsign software and publish the ad to an individual screen
5908476 we have a group of ads that runs on the sign about every 2 1 2 minutes the advertisers are local businesses such as dentists fast food restaurants and real estate agents
5908477 digital signs are an emerging market and the reason is the underlying problem with print advertising in places like banking retail and quick serve restaurants
5908478 you print the material send it to a location and hope the manager puts it up and takes it down when he or she is supposed to digital signage does all that for you
5908479 in many cases we dont know if anyone saw the advertising

5908500 i might be speaking against something that god is actually doing
5908501 mccain has always had an uphill fight in california but he had a much greater opportunity here than republicans have had in many years
5908502 he drew two lessons from the iowa caucuses that negative ads dont work and that

5908505 initially i committed to be chairman of carlyle for one year
5908506 but year after year i continued to be impressed with carlyles value creation model and its efforts to globalize the firm however at this point in my life i have a number of goals and interests yet to fulfill requiring me to step back at carlyle
5908507 is going to protect consumers from the annoyance and invasion of prerecorded sales messages that seem to be increasing every day
5908508 the prerecorded message was an inexpensive way to reach customers and now youll have to use operators to reach those customers
5908509 the entire record is clear that an overwhelming number of consumers hate prerecorded calls
5908510 he came to my house and basically was talking about how to peak how to go to a big time event and produce your best performance
5908511 he was obviously a very talented competitor himself and knew what to do but was feeling that he was slightly underachieving at the big events
5908512 the only way to learn experience without actually going through it yourself is learn from somebody else
5908513 kenny was not afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me and i love to talk so i was more than obliging
5908514 the following day they went out and lost to carlow which is one of the favorite teams losing to one of the lower down teams so it was a bit of an upset
5908515 i wouldnt say i have a 100 percent record in these things but it is great to see kenny doing so well
5908516 hopefully i can make the team if i can play well here this week and next week
5908517 id like to make the team outright i still think i need to play well this week and next week to get a pick i would like to qualify on my own terms

5908520 paul mawhinney was born and raised in pittsburgh pa over the years he has amassed what has become the worlds largest record collection due to health issues and a struggling record industry paul is being forced to sell his collection this is the story of a man and his records i hope you enjoy it
5908521 both diesel and fertiliser are among our major resources for farming just like electricity
5908522 it is therefore our concern that the prices of fertiliser and diesel have risen three fold this means that our farmers will not be in a position to produce as much crop to feed the nation as they did last season 2007 08
5908523 with these subsidies the number of our vulnerable but viable farmers benefiting from this programme will increase from 125 000 in 2007 to 200 000 next season
5908524 whereas we appreciate the governments decision to provide more fertiliser under the support programme there are still many many small scale farmers who will not benefit from the programme this is why we are now encouraging our farmers to go for conservation farming as the best practice at the moment
5908525 as znfu we have conclusively proved that conservation farming can produce wonders if we can produce at least 2 5 tonnes per hectare then we would be feeding the whole region and conservation farming is able to guarantee that at national level we are currently producing 1 3 tonnes per hectare
5908526 we have helped 6 000 farmers so far and we hope to help 80 000 farmers over the next five years
5908527 to clear off bank loans and other drafts that were outstanding
5908528 the only way forward for zambia is to ensure our farmers grow more food to avoid imports food has a critical role to play in a countrys inflation and if we cant grow enough then the prices of food and indeed all commodities are likely to be even more expensive next year
5908529 i think this is the right time to start thinking of alternative means of production
5908530 a champion of the democratisation of the sadc region in particular and the african continent in general as such his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people who at this stage are yearning for a new beginning which can unquestionably be characterised as democratic and a reflection of the will of the people
5908531 a serious blot on the culture of democracy in our sub region
5908532 the region has truly lost one of the most influential figures contributing to resolving the zimbabwe situation it now leaves botswana alone
5908533 his mwanawasas leadership was slowly beginning to take away that conservative and freedom fighter mentality which has been undermining governance and democracy in the region the onus now is on the other regional leaders to consolidate on that
5908534 there will be a lot of infighting for the presidency as the mmd has no party vice president who should have been an automatic replacement for president mwanawasa they may have to go to the national convention but time is not allowing them i think we shall soon see the formation of a break away party from mmd before the elections

5908541 to try to sum him up is not easy because he would have been only two in december and thats all we had him but he was so special to us were going to miss him horribly
5908542 he went in his room he was upset because he missed his mama her boyfriend went into the other room to lay his daughters clothes out to get her dressed for the day when he came out of the other bedroom he was collapsed on the floor
5908543 the detective said to sara well healthy babies dont just die
5908544 it will be interesting to see if the obama campaign chooses to campaign heavily in arizona
5908545 hey why dont you try on the dress i wore to my nephews wedding
5908546 i would rather die than go for vct voluntary counselling and testing
5908547 as far as i am concerned it is better to remain ignorant of your status we have seen so many people dying quickly upon knowing their hiv positive status i know what i have done and i also know what i havent done but believe me having an hiv test is the last thing on my mind not even on my death bed
5908548 the uptake of vct services is still unacceptably low in zambia despite government and non governmental organisations efforts to make vct as widely available as possible
5908549 comprehensive antiretroviral therapy services are now available in all 73 of our districts this is as opposed to the situation that existed only five years ago when we only had two such sites
5908550 the thing is there is a very big misconception that catching hiv is a form of punishment from god for ones sins or promiscuous life just the other day i had a case of a lady i think in her late 20s who wept uncontrollably after her results came out hiv positive she said god has betrayed me i have lived a sinless life and i am still a virgin why should i be hiv positive
5908551 vct hasnt attracted a lot of people because we are not looking at access to facilities people have to travel from the townships into town to be tested which costs money
5908552 and obviously when it comes to competing with finding food no one would give preference to going for vct services must be taken to the people as it is we dont have enough structures to support the level of intervention operations that we would like to see
5908553 the programme should have been comprehensive there must be drugs there must be food and there must be facilities all over
5908554 vct promotes early knowledge of hiv status which is now recognised as a critical component in controlling the spread of new hiv infections
5908555 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5908556 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team
5908557 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5908558 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far the mystics need athletes and we need scorers and we need a roster of young ladies whose collective physical skills make other teams in the league dread the thought of playing us
5908559 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5908560 in the three years that i have been an owner and a general partner our thinking has been far too shortsighted and our player personnel decisions are far too needs based that all ends today

5908566 i think theres the start of a chemistry but it takes time to develop that
5908567 the more you can play together the better that chemistry is the biggest thing is i think were similar in a lot of ways i think we can both bring the pressure off the edges
5908568 which guy do you slide to which guy do you chip how are you going to chip only one of them
5908569 really if you look at andre hes got to be excited because he has been chipped most of the year in the past
5908570 well come off the field and ill tell him whats going on my side hell tell me whats going on on his side
5908571 this last game i told andre he could beat the guy inside he was telling me what jets tackle dbrickashaw ferguson was doing over there you share that knowledge so throughout the game youll know what to expect when you get over there
5908572 i think people get the idea of being a leader a little messed up
5908573 a leader just doesnt come in and start saying things and breaking chalkboards and throwing bottles around the locker room it starts with your play im not a big rah rah guy thats high school stuff the pregame talks and win one for the gipper id rather go out there and play hard and show them the way to do it there comes a time where you have to stand up and grab someone by the face mask and get things going and that just comes naturally i think when you talk too much you lose credibility when you do the right thing your words carry a lot more weight
5908574 when you know what youre doing and youre confident in what youre doing and you prepare yourself you can be relaxed and kind of kick butt when you have to we cant walk around the street sacking people in the grocery store and being jerks youve got to be personable but on sundays we can turn it on and get it done
5908575 its a day at a time in this league life is so short so im going to enjoy this media session and go get ready to practice and enjoy that and hopefully see you tomorrow
5908576 the school should be a safe place for all the pupils
5908577 i have been very much disturbed emotionally disturbed and very much stressed i am trying very hard to forget how it happened but i am failing i cant just forget it its like its just about to happen again like its just happening i remember everything every detail
5908578 i am still hurting i cry always when i remember criticism from people they would come and say things like it never happened you are lying things like that
5908579 it started when i asked for some past examination papers from my teacher when i asked him about the papers he asked me to go and collect them from his home that is when everything happened
5908580 what happened was wrong it shouldnt happen it shouldnt be accepted the school should be a safe place for all the pupils such things shouldnt be happening at school
5908581 i have heard many stories of pupils who are raped by teachers but i never knew it could happen to me i think the school is not a safe place for pupils anymore
5908582 but i think if measures are taken schools can be safe places but its like they the authorities havent started taking such measures to make a school a safe place
5908583 i was hurting after the rape i was very emotionally stressed i was not myself i would cry a lot so i told my other teacher about it he advised me to tell someone i needed to come out in the open
5908584 i think it has made me to be a strong girl i am a hero to some people they always tell me that i am a hero
5908585 i see that teacher who raped me is still around but he is not coming to teach i think he has been fired

5908638 we never said we are inviting people to come here because this is a sanctuary city
5908639 is an important issue with a lot of our constituents citizens feel laws are not being upheld and they as taxpayers are having to pay for citizens who are breaking the laws
5908640 we should have the ability to enforce our laws if someone commits a crime in our state and we find out theyre an illegal alien i think that needs to be one of the things we prosecute illegal aliens for

5908644 well i think in the medium term it definitely needs to happen but at present local government have control and im quite comfortable leaving it in their control
5908645 a lot of them are banning it and good on them
5908646 as has been the case i think with the smoking ban in pubs and clubs and so on we havent really played a large role in that
5908647 obviously we looked right across the government expenditure in the recent budget and we tightened
5908648 the way ive constructed the opposition the shadow cabinet is that i want everyone thats in that team thats 11 of us to resume a responsibility to ensure this government is held to account
5908649 once the election result is known or declared which happened on monday those people have seven days in which to decide whether they want to withdraw that resignation or let it stand
5908650 needs to figure out if hes going to let rush limbaugh and the right wing of his party direct his choice

5908652 to explain to them minot states story about vision 2013 and where we are going they are key players in helping us realize that
5908653 there is a large dedication to the university and that is important i have seen other places where higher education is taking the budget crunch rather hard
5908654 do they continue to teach in an under budget under remunerated highly casualised tafe system or do they go off the industry and into a secondary school
5908655 they are seeking an agreement that covers every tafe provider in victoria
5908656 but taking industrial action they are putting in danger a key plank of their claim and thats too have one agreement with the sector
5908657 we have said that we would go to an umpire through the industrial relations commission to work through our differences
5908658 tafe is struggling to attract teachers particularly in the skills shortages areas
5908659 it doesnt seem to make sense that you would include in the tax hybrid vehicles green vehicles that are ultra fuel efficient
5908660 we havent heard back and i think the prime ministers departments yet to wake up to the powers of the senate
5908661 it would be better for the government to have responded long ago to the greens request and to have come up with a proposal
5908662 its 12 years since labor was in office and many of the ministers are not practised with making informative approaches to the senate
5908663 the senates got an important role as a watchdog as a house of review and i think thats why so many australians voted differently in the lower house compared to how they voted in the senate
5908664 the government has a mandate to govern and in general we will be respectful of that but we do have a mandate of our own as well to put forward pieces of legislation which the government has to treat seriously
5908665 i can tell you this if there are questions arising out of legislation if the information isnt available that the senate needs to make a proper decision i have no doubt that the senate will insist that information is made available before the vote on that legislation proceeds
5908666 so it would be judicious of the government to be consulting early giving senators whatever information they require and looking at alternatives coming from the crossbenches and the opposition

5908681 the last three years have been enormously consequential for telstra and australia with the full privatisation of telstra construction of the worlds largest fastest and most advanced wireless broadband network and the transformation of telstra into the worlds first next generation fully integrated telco
5908682 it was hard for some to give up the idea that telstra is community property the cultural change required by privatisation was difficult both for telstra and for the government
5908683 though we were criticised by some our new approach achieved important results including safeguarding new investments like nextg and adsl2 from value destroying regulation winding back regulation on more than four million copper telephone lines and the reversal of a 1 billion taxpayer gift to singtel optus
5908684 working in a country and culture not your own is an enormous privilege and working for one of its iconic companies is a privilege amplified
5908685 my time in australia and with telstra has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life both personally and professionally
5908686 folks who are in need of a little bit of extra help can come here and get it

5908689 im sure once we put all of those supplies in there its a lot more than that

5908707 we are well funded probably better funded than anyone competing here thats showing through but it takes time to do that other sports have the same opportunity as we have had i think there are lessons to be learned and we would like them to learn those lessons we really would
5908708 i do believe it is now possible for us to use this success as a spur for action to say this is what can be done we are your most successful olympic sport its not just what we can do for our agenda its what we can do for the national agenda for all of the things that are good that come from cycling we are at a tipping point cycling is really big news

5908713 the primary purpose of a 1999 clinical study that merck amp co inc said was done to test side effects of vioxx was actually to support a marketing campaign before the now withdrawn painkillers launch according to u s researchers the real aim of the study called advantage was to promote prescription of the new medicine when it became available a so called seeding project the researchers said on tuesday the research team based its conclusions on an extensive trawl of merck internal and external documents collected by plaintiffs lawyers preparing for vioxx lawsuits documentary evidence shows that advantage is an example of marketing framed as science they wrote in the journal annals of internal medicine
5908714 to second guess the mind set of a young man in the heat of battle four years later and to put the question in a civilian court system that cant even remotely comprehend the battlefield is shameful for this government
5908715 while not acknowledging that any part of the governments case is true the fact is the military sent these people out to do a job and kill everything that moved in a city where there were no good guys left
5908716 if we incorporate a town here and or go in with bargersville or greenwood were gonna end up paying more taxes
5908717 what i am hearing from the residents of white river is that they dont feel like they have enough voice in the planning and development of the area
5908718 i think what we are really looking at is whether or not we have grown to the point where we are already by population like a small city but with no government and whether or not it is time that we govern ourselves or continue to be governed by the county
5908719 we have a situation that has been unfolding here for the last number of days with regards to the possibility of our track being downgraded from a race track to a training track
5908720 whether thats happening or not i dont think it is but weve got to find out for sure
5908721 i understand theres a study taking place in relation to racing on p e i i would like to know whos doing it and whats going on
5908722 obviously if somebody makes a decision to downgrade the track to a training track theyll not be putting any grandstands in
5908723 were not going to accept that we want to be fair and were prepared to work with the government weve got to get in front of this and make this happen
5908724 were just looking for something thats practical and decent and thats big enough to match in with the wellness centre so we can keep the harness racing industry going in summerside
5908725 im really honoured to have my design selected as it will form part of the legacy of this event on prince edward island
5908726 we at the delta prince edward look forward to welcoming the many visitors to prince edward island some of whom the athletes will have the opportunity to win beautifully designed medals as weve seen today
5908727 were going to try and take a run at the three spot in pool b
5908728 a realistic goal is if we go 3 2 and we should be able to have a shot at that three spot
5908729 that gives the advantage to the other teams because they have deeper pitching staffs
5908730 what our boys have to do is they have to pitch effectively we hit 459 in the elimination tournament and we just have to keep doing what were doing at the plate and play some sound defence
5908731 its going to come down to how our island team can handle the fact pitching staffs are going to be used up quick
5908732 were expecting to be very competitive with the teams from the maritimes
5908733 we know the reality of playing ontario youre up against teams that are picking from 600 700 kids
5908734 whitby and brampton are here from ontario and theyll be quite strong we want to try and give them a game and take them to seven innings well be playing ontario 1 brantford and that will be our benchmark
5908735 well be playing quebec 2 laval and thats a game wed like to be in its the sort of thing you could go 0 4 won lost but a 2 2 record for us in the round robin would be a real success
5908736 softball p e i is doing a pilot project where we have east and west all star teams
5908737 the western selects will be host and provincial champions and the eastern all stars will be the provincial representative
5908738 ive been to a number of eastern canadians and this is probably my fifth or sixth one and because this is an all star team this is by far the deepest team ive had
5908739 weve gone where weve had one pitcher and this year we have five pitchers who can pitch
5908740 you have kids who can hit one to nine and not one to four we have five kids from the west tignish oleary and evangeline and they really add to the 10 kids from summerside
5908741 we played two games the other night and i came home picked up a piece of paper to do a lineup for the next night and i couldnt do it
5908742 kenny tried it the next morning and we didnt know anything about each other doing it and he couldnt do it either
5908743 somebody is going to have to sit who deserves to be playing because you cant play more than nine

5908771 los jugadores siguen creyendo en m y seguimos con la misma idea no tenemos los suficientes puntos porque en los dos primeros partidos que tuvimos imponderables a nuestro favor no los aprovechamos pero estamos unidos y seguiremos con la misma idea hasta obtener la victoria
5908772 por estad stica los rbitros se equivocan cuatro veces en un partido para mala fortuna las dos primeras fueron en contra del puebla se al una falta y una expulsi n que no existieron eso al equipo le afect las llegadas de toluca fueron circunstanciales y estoy seguro que el marcador lo remont bamos sin problemas

5908795 barack obama is so radically pro abortion he supports infanticide
5908796 the suggestion that obama the proud father of two little girls and others who opposed these bills supported infanticide is deeply offensive and insulting
5908797 he needs to explain misleading people he needs to explain why he apparently covered that up
5908798 theyre being very dishonest about their depiction of what happened with that bill or just clueless
5908799 im a little surprised that people dont understand how easy i think it is for a young person especially myself to see this major situation as a positive i mean i dont see it as a positive but im not complaining about it

5908835 especially if government could continue showing that it could respond appropriately and within the limits of law and order
5908836 the impact on business and trading cannot be immediately measured but i think theres not much impact because the fighting was fairly recent
5908837 is responding quite well and i think there should be no need for businessmen in areas near the conflict to arm themselves
5908838 so far our members have not reported any abrupt changes in their trading activities and none of our suppliers and partners outside mindanao have called us to inquire on the situation
5908839 business have wanted to be clarified on these incidents and when the milf has told government that it has no control over these rogue groups i believe the government has treated these incidents as terroristic and mere banditry and therefore responding to them within the legal limits
5908840 that at situations like this no one can prevent them from arming themselves to protect their communities
5908841 to put up now proactive programs to prevent these kinds of occurrences that disturb the routine activities in mindanao
5908842 these may be expensive though and require more massive cooperation from both the armed forces and the police and the civilians and that includes us businessmen

5908854 to give you an example more than 20 years ago i was the only one in the world to predict the discovery of billions of quasars in the infrared spectrum as well as an accelerating expansion of the universe
5908855 the dutch satellite iras was launched on january 26th 1983
5908856 according to geryl iras should be able to prove that his calculations are correct and that the satellite should trace billions of supergalaxies that radiate extremely high energies and are besides very rapidly moving away from us almost at the speed of light
5908857 this implies that these kinds of systems cannot be seen from earth with normal light telescopes but with the help of an infrared telescope like the one the dutch space probe has aboard should iras discover such systems this would mean that the relativity theory of einstein is not correct and would give us a complete new space time dimension so says geryl
5908858 according to the relativity theory the quickest galaxies of the cosmos the quasar systems should age more slowly moreover one should not detect any rapid changes in their structure and gravitational force besides the quasar worlds should radiate less energy because of their time dilatation however according to the man from deurne one doesnt actually see this time dilatation but something completely different something that subverts the complete theory of einstein
5908859 the quasars are collapsing they perish even faster than other galaxies in fact the superexplosions are taking place at a very high speed so this means that the quasars are not at all sensitive to this time dilatation on the contrary they are far more unstable and they are destroying themselves with a catastrophical gravitational collapse they even accelerate their self destruction through the coagulating mass because mass increases with speed and they finally die in the most violent explosions of the universe
5908860 in his easy reading book geryl explains these phenomena concluding that the world famous relativity theory is not correct his deductions are astonishing and create a completely new space time dimension whose implications will be enormous and if geryl is right of extreme importance to science the future will show who is right
5908861 on friday november 23rd 1990 again i explained everything to the popular scientific
5908862 in the early nineties billions of quasars were discovered in the infrared spectrum
5908863 in 1998 it became known that the universe is expanding with an acceleration
5908864 it is in this region that the shielding effect of the magnetic field is severely reduced thus allowing high energy particles of the hard radiation belt to penetrate deep into the upper atmosphere to altitudes below a hundred kilometers 62 miles

5908867 its very important to reveal the mystery of the pyramid science in archaeology is very important people all over the world are waiting to solve this mystery
5908868 i believe that these doors are hiding something it could be and this is a theory that maybe khufus cheops chamber is still hidden in the pyramid
5908869 we will almost certainly learn why those two lower shafts were specially constructed to be totally invisible and we will finally gain the long sought key we require to unlock the overall mystery of the cheops pyramid

5908887 but the saddest illustration of this infatuation is to be found in the attitude that many men take in regard to christianity there is a great craving to day more perhaps than there has been in some other periods of the worlds history for a religion which shall adorn but shall not restrain for a religion which shall be toothless and have no bite in it for a religion that shall sanction anything that it pleases our sovereign mightiness to want to do we should all like to have gods sanction for our actions but there are a great many of us who will not take the only way to secure that viz to do the actions which he commands and to abstain from those which he forbids popular christianity is a very easy fitting garment it is like an old shoe that you can slip off and on without any difficulty but a religion which does not put up a strong barrier between you and many of your inclinations in not worth anything the mark of a message from god is that it restrains and coerces and forbids and commands and some of you do not like it because it does

5908894 the challenge for west virginia the challenge for coal producing states and nations is that as historically produced coal is a dirty fuel and is regarded as a dirty fuel
5908895 and there are environmental issues associated with the production and consumption of coal
5908896 if you want to do energy well in an environmentally sound fashion go to west virginia go to appalachia
5908897 we all win in that equation thats our great opportunity
5908898 the physically reality is that we cannot bridge to the future for decades if not hundreds of years without coal as part of the equation
5908899 if you accept that premise then your choices are how do we do coal well how do we do coal clean how do we capture the opportunities for coal
5908900 carbon sequestration is going to double the cost of coal fired power
5908901 one of the coal presidents said it is at least 15 maybe 20 years away from being commercially viable
5908902 there are a myriad of legal issues that are unresolved whos going to take the liability if it comes back out of the ground and the energy it takes ive heard estimates it could take 15 or 20 of the power of the power plant makes to strip out the co 2 thats going to raise the cost of electricity
5908903 im not sure that we can really appease the individuals that want to see coal eliminated abolished from the energy mix of this country
5908904 but those individuals and groups that have concerns about the environment or the impacts of mining certainly we can be more responsive to those concerns
5908905 right now we dont have a comprehensive bill out there
5908906 we havent been allowed to vote on anything that i think is going to address high gasoline prices and dependence on foreign oil and any time we do get something its a fight to get anything related to coal in there

5908913 some of the best relationships are those where both parties have completely independent hobbies and allow for the concept of his her and our time
5908914 a kiss can be a romantic erotic experience with someone you find physically attractive but a relationship will crumble without more complex attributes like shared values
5908915 constantly thinking about another person isnt love its infatuation and infatuation has no correlation with being a good match
5908916 if you have warm and comfortable feelings when you think about your date that indicates a relationship built on stability trust and a strong friendship factor denoting a relationship that will more likely wear well over time

5908930 do you curse the happy couple do you cringe at wedding bells do you drink up all the punch while you wish them all to hell
5908931 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
5908932 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
5908933 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
5908934 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine
5908935 i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then i choose from this not because someone told me this player is good but because i made the decision
5908936 i would have been really disappointed and im sure the players who didnt get it feel the same way
5908937 i was standing next to rio and the first thing he did was shake my hand which is great and shows what kind of man and character he is
5908938 you hear little whispers and with the form that rio has been in and what man utd have achieved i did think he would get it
5908939 rio has been in great form for manchester united in the last couple of years what he has achieved has been an example we can all learn from that and its great that i beat players like that to the job
5908940 the manager said he takes control of all the tactics and all those big decisions and its my job to keep the players moving forward
5908941 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5908942 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5908943 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5908944 stepped right in between he planted his face firmly in the face of the guy hey hey hey and the guy backpedaled and we kept walking
5908945 obama in the eyes of some right wingers is basically muslim until proved innocent
5908946 its partly the muslim factor by association and partly the fear of something being twisted
5908947 an unpretentious down to earth solidly middle class guy who seemed somewhat more sophisticated than the average college student he was slightly reserved and deliberate in a way that i sometimes thought betrayed an uncertainty
5908948 he definitely had a cocky sometimes arrogant way about him he was not open to others
5908949 he was an athletic guy he was gifted in that regard
5908950 super bright he could get through the course work in a fraction of the time it took me
5908951 we let it slide because he spent a lot of time growing up in hawaii
5908952 i want to write and help people who are disadvantaged
5908953 he was clearly shocked by the economic disparity he saw in pakistan he couldnt get over the sight of rural peasants bowing to the wealthy landowners they worked for as they passed
5908954 at that age i thought he was a saint and a square and he took himself too seriously
5908955 i would ask him why he was so serious he was genuinely concerned with the plight of the poor hed give me lectures which i found very boring he must have found me very irritating
5908956 we were both very lost we were both alienated although he might not put it that way he arrived disheveled and without a place to stay
5908957 we didnt have a chance in hell of getting this apartment unless we fabricated the lease application
5908958 wanted no part of it he put down the truth
5908959 i didnt socialize that much i was like a monk
5908960 for about two years there i was just painfully alone and really not focused on anything except maybe thinking a lot
5908961 i think self deprivation was his schtick denying himself pleasure good food and all of that
5908962 you know how it is you go to a bar and you try hitting on the girls he had a lot more success i wouldnt out compete him in picking up girls thats for sure
5908963 i was partying all the time i was disrupting his studies
5908964 the thought believe me never crossed my mind that he would be our first black president
5908965 my name is hal siddiqi and i approve of this message vote for peace vote for hope vote for change and vote for obama
5908966 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself
5908967 a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers they stripped him of his clothes beat him and went away leaving him half dead
5908968 which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers
5908969 we saw that health and private duty nursing since it was unlimited and had unsustainable growth that if we didnt put in some reasonable limits we were going to have a budget crisis on our hands not just in tenncare but potentially again in all of state government
5908970 when you are imposing really these caps and limits youre really excluding that from the discussion i think people are just wanting an opportunity to tell their story tell how the family has adjusted how the sacrifice has been made and important it is for this family to stay together
5908971 it helps the officer in claims he did the right thing
5908972 if we strike people with the baton strike them with our hands or use pepper spray on them because theyre not complying with being arrested this hurts them a lot less than anything weve ever used before
5908973 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
5908974 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
5908975 the government has been deceiving the milf for a long time
5908976 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5908977 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them
5908978 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5908979 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
5908980 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
5908981 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
5908982 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
5908983 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it
5908984 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
5908985 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
5908986 running a hedge fund is harder than it looks on tv
5908987 petite leggy women with big busts are the most sexually attractive study reveals
5908988 protester sheehan and public enemy coming to denver for dnc
5908989 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
5908990 hes disgraced himself hes an embarrassment to the clayton county police department his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone and i have no use for him
5908991 his behavior is unbecoming of that of a police officer
5908992 this turn of events from hero to someone who defrauds a nation is just baffling i dont know how he got from one point to the other
5908993 we havent been able to get in touch with him
5908994 oppose legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in state or federal revenue
5908995 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
5908996 this is veep week that in reality is about all that anyone outside sen barack obamas inner inner circle knows
5908997 unless its al gore or john kerry or santa claus
5908998 project based on the life of the late comedian bill hicks
5908999 i have another project based on the life of comedian bill hicks which is going from treatment to draft stage with kiwi writer mark staufer
5909000 we fully intend to comply with the process and make sure they get all the information they need
5909001 without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone that comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him
5909002 dont be afraid be strong be bold be very courageous for the lord your god is with you wherever you go
5909003 in the same sentence as a believer i know that in
5909004 some men know that a light touch of the tongue running from a womans toes to her ears lingering in the softest way possible in various places in between given often enough and sincerely enough would add immeasurably to world peace
5909005 mudgee is currently the fastest growing coal producing region in nsw
5909006 if planned expansion of the three mines ulan wilpinjong and moolarben goes ahead there will be between forty and fifty million tonnes of coal produced per year from this area
5909007 there is two and a half tonnes of co2 produced from every tonne of coal which means the mudgee region could be responsible for the release of 150 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere
5909008 it creates severe subsidence and interferes with the ground water system
5909009 subsidence can also initiate tremors which can be the equivalent of small earthquakes
5909010 we want to extend the goulburn river national park to include the drip gorge and land currently held in lease by the moolarben mine
5909011 when you see the enormous devastation caused to a pristine environment by coal mining companies its outrageous enough
5909012 but when you convert the practice into greenhouse gas emissions its terrifying and australia is one of the biggest emitters in the world
5909013 chinese growth and prosperity displayed on our tv sets each night throughout the olympics its hard to imagine that chinas stock market could be doing so poorly
5909014 anyone hoping that the olympics would give ailing chinese stocks a boost has gotten a rude awakening
5909015 historically the olympics host countrys stock index captures a nice bounce following the event over the last six olympiads the average gain for host countries stock indexes has been 19 in the six months following the games and 26 in the 12 months after the games none of that effect has been apparent in china yet where markets continue to suffer in spite of robust economic growth both the shanghai market etf ewh are down this week yet from an investment viewpoint many stocks in china are getting downright cheap
5909016 i have never thought the mania in china was worse than the bubble in tech stocks so i have always felt the decline would be less than 75 fifty percent declines dont occur that often and so 60 seems like a reasonable overshoot of cutting in half
5909017 some government inspired buying or even patriotic olympic related buying or more measures from the authorities aimed at propping up the markets but if none of those i think the very bad mood could be extended expectations about the transformational consequences of the olympics are unrealistically high and i think there is bound to be some disappointment
5909018 a substantial part of any investors portfolio should be in china and any other countries where manufacturing is growing as a percentage of the world total
5909019 property continues to grow from something of a niche topic to one which has become an integral part of the new zealand news media and given the events in the property market and in the wider economy in the last 12 months we look forward to some particularly interesting entries
5909020 property is such a vital part of new zealands infrastructure and key sectors such as tourism and retailing which are reliant on a vibrant property market to ensure their vital infrastructure continues to develop
5909021 property journalism plays an important role in both good times and bad and the changing economic environment for both residential and commercial property development and investment in the last year has seen journalists having to extend themselves to cover the growing complexity of the market
5909022 our members play a huge role in the economy and it is essential that their activities and objectives are well understood and conveyed often through the media to the wider public
5909023 dat kan ik altijd zien maar wees gerust ik heb een oplossing je slaat gewoon een driedubbele wisky achterover en gaat naar het dak van dit flatgebouw springt eraf en dan zit je over 2 minuten gewoon weer hier in de kantine
5909024 ik ben wel aardig dronken maar dat ik van een flatgebouw afspring zo dronken nog net niet
5909025 renewing americas promise starts with leaders who put the needs of the american people first the women of the united states senate serve as an inspiration to us all
5909026 the 2008 convention is excited to honor these leaders and to highlight their checklist for change
5909027 american families want change and the women of the united states senate are committed to helping deliver it for them
5909028 from pay equity to protecting the family checkbook making health care affordable and taking care of our military families there is a clear difference between the two parties and the two candidates voters have a clear choice this year if they want to move the country forward the women of the united states senate stand ready to deliver our checklist for change
5909029 pharmaxis intends to file a marketing application in australia for bronchitol as soon as possible now that this study has concluded satisfactorily
5909030 bronchitol has created a great deal of interest among people suffering with bronchiectasis and we continue to respond to requests from trial participants and others interested in bronchitol we are looking forward to bringing bronchitol to the market place and are delighted this trial has concluded successfully
5909031 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state
5909032 we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
5909033 the good news from america most environmentalists are indeed leftists who support the redistribution of wealth and believe in a simpler lifestyle
5909034 menjadi tugas kita bersama agar bagaimana demokrasi ini tidak berbalik dan berlanjut ke system yang tidak demokratis
5909035 pada zaman orde baru kita pinjam uang dari bank dunia baru 30 tahun kemudian kita melunasi utang
5909036 nah kalau tidak ada demokrasi kita tidak tahu uang negara kemana
5909037 persoalannya kemudian kalau orang mulai berpikir kembali ke masa lalu saya termasuk yang tidak setuju
5909038 lihat demokrasi rakyat miskin demokrasi kan hanya alat lebih baik masa lalu
5909039 sekarang posisi negara yang kuat tidak ada lagi anggaran kita habis untuk membayar hutang dan untuk anggaran rutin kita saja sudah habis
5909040 lleg entonces a efeso un jud o llamado apolos natural de alejandr a var n elocuente poderoso en las escrituras este hab a sido instruido en el camino del se or y siendo de esp ritu fervoroso hablaba y ense aba diligentemente lo concerniente al se or

5909042 the nhpc authorities here requested me to be part of the team and make a recce of the area through which the alternative road may pass and i obliged the visit will be an informal one as the forest department has not yet received a formal application from nhpc asking for the transfer of necessary land
5909043 we are prepared to trade fire with them until we are decimated if they cannot finish us we will finish them
5909044 we are prepared to kill we are prepared to be killed
5909045 the government has been deceiving the milf for a long time
5909046 in its struggle against terrorism france has just been hard hit
5909047 my determination is intact france is committed to pursuing the struggle against terrorism for democracy and for freedom
5909048 this is a just cause it is an honour for france and for its army to defend it
5909049 serious measures notably in the air were taken to support and extricate our men caught in an extremely violent ambush
5909050 the doctor prescribed a pain killer and issued a certificate saying he is fit to travel
5909051 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5909052 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5909053 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
5909054 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
5909055 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
5909056 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
5909057 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
5909058 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
5909059 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
5909060 we see him on the news but we dont pay much attention to him
5909061 doctors who prescribe them are stigmatized by their colleagues patients who use them are stigmatized by their families their friends and by other doctors
5909062 basically about every sixth american suffers from pain every day
5909063 if this were cancer if this were heart disease if this were hiv it would be considered the no 1 health concern in the country thats the insanity of all this
5909064 there are virtually no studies that show improved function and pain relief from these drugs beyond six months
5909065 were also starting to recognize that when you give these drugs at high dosages over a long period they actually start to produce pain
5909066 here at the university we dont use opioids narcotics for chronic pain at all and we treat lots of pain patients very effectively
5909067 having said that its now the consensus in the pain specialty community that opioids are appropriate for a carefully selected subpopulation of chronic pain patients who can benefit with tolerable side effects and with no problems of abuse
5909068 it can be very confusing to sort through who is there for an acute pain condition whos there for a chronic pain condition and who is there for something that is more of a drug addiction problem
5909069 very often we have to give the patient the benefit of the doubt its an issue emergency physicians struggle with daily
5909070 rather be duped by someone seeking narcotics than to neglect to give medications to someone who really needs them
5909071 i can tell you speaking as the president of the board that were not going after anybody who is in compliance with these guidelines
5909072 i recently had a physician come to see me who said he was nervous about continuing to treat chronic pain patients
5909073 i gave him a copy of our guidelines and said sign contracts with your patients and were not going to do anything to you as long as youre doing that
5909074 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5909075 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5909076 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5909077 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5909078 well no but you have to ask yourself what it means
5909079 president elect mccain will be making a very big mistake by appointing joe leiberman as his vp
5909080 you ever notice how anyone who stands between them and power is an evil idiot bent on the destruction of the world funny how that works
5909081 actually the far right often accuses chavez not only of wanting to take over south america but often insinuate that hes working with iran to install nukes the far right often accuses syria of attacking us interests granted considering israel is our 51st state thats not unexpected as for mugabe the far right has been rather silent i guess its more important to pretend that were all georgians than to take an actual stand on mugabes horrific abuses
5909082 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5909083 generates about 240 billion in annual revenues and employs a quarter million germans germanys wind industry created 8 000 jobs in 2007 alone and one recent study suggested that the renewable sector could provide more work than the auto industry currently the nations biggest employer by 2020
5909084 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
5909085 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
5909086 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5909087 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5909088 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5909089 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5909090 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5909091 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5909092 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5909093 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5909094 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5909095 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5909096 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5909097 the convention will offer a series of contrasts and comparisions of the mccain record so voters can see how clearly the choice will be in november
5909098 the convention will also introduce senator obama to the country but it will make sure to convey strongly the differences and choices obamas campaign presents over mccains
5909099 the 2009 schedule reflects realigned dates that are good opportunities for everyone involved in our sport fans sponsors tracks and teams
5909100 the presumptive democratic presidential nominee will announce his running mate
5909101 serene self confidence even arrogance would likely add a necessary dash of bareknuckle candor to obamas high road bid
5909102 by selecting the pro choice ridge as his running mate mccain would a appeal to moderate swing voters b extend an olive branch to pro choice former clintonistas dissatisfied with obama c reinforce his perceived edge over the democratic nominee in the experience and foreign policy departments and d have a shot at competing in pennsylvania
5909103 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5909104 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5909105 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5909106 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5909107 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5909108 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5909109 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5909110 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5909111 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5909112 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5909113 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
5909114 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
5909115 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
5909116 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
5909117 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
5909118 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
5909119 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
5909120 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
5909121 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
5909122 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
5909123 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
5909124 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
5909125 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
5909126 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
5909127 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
5909128 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5909129 there is no question there is a lot more excitement in our state for sen obama than there is for sen mccain r ariz
5909130 sen obama is seen as a huge breath of fresh air
5909131 well be focusing on the continuation of the last eight years and more of the same
5909132 i need to focus on my re election and he needs to focus on his campaign
5909133 were on the brink of a financial meltdown i o u s a boldly examines the rapidly growing national debt and its consequences for the united states and its citizens
5909134 our nation suffers from a fiscal cancer that threatens the future economic well being of our country children and grandchildren
5909135 this isnt just a financial issue its a moral issue it is immoral to keep kicking this can down the road for younger generations to grapple with its time for real action rather than more rhetoric
5909136 i o u s a live with warren buffett pete peterson amp dave walker
5909137 tell me what it is this isnt about t boone pickens it isnt about democrats and republicans this ones about america
5909138 it says more about them than anything how they think how they envision their governing and so this is probably the most important thing they do until they show themselves in debates
5909139 theyll walk you in and theyll say ok weve got a question about your tax return or we have a question about this stock that you owned that you sold or we have a question about this speech that you gave or this vote that you took or this veto that you made
5909140 the spouses are an issue that was probably the one thing that surprised me the most is how much what your spouse has done said written makes a difference
5909141 you need to have a maximum impact around your convention when all eyes are on your party
5909142 kemp complemented dole in that he helped promote his pro growth economic ideas of cutting taxes and he also helped energize the party
5909143 anything that gets in the way that has the potential to diminish that youd rather not have
5909144 this cycle probably the best time to do it is on the friday afternoon when the democrats leave denver
5909145 why not start to squash their bounce and ride it through the weekend into minneapolis
5909146 theres a little bit of stagecraft that goes on at the end of the process to not only make sure it has an element of surprise but to really have a wow factor
5909147 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5909148 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5909149 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5909150 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5909151 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5909152 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5909153 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5909154 they told me there are going to be resources here
5909155 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5909156 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5909157 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5909158 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5909159 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5909160 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5909161 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5909162 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5909163 we are thrilled about the new look of our 2009 schedule
5909164 the amp energy 500 weekend is now an even bigger factor in the chase for the nascar sprint cup and the aarons dream weekend has become a triple header with the addition of the arca re max series race theres a new level of intensity surrounding our races and its going to be an exciting year at talladega you dont want to miss it
5909165 fans have been clamoring for a sprint cup series race under the lights at atlanta motor speedway
5909166 its thrilling to bring labor day racing back to the south on nascars fastest track this will be a great opportunity for atlanta motor speedway to celebrate our 50th year of racing
5909167 mark this day down as a great day in nascar history when traditional labor day weekend racing returns to the south
5909168 in my opinion there is nothing more exciting than racing under the lights add to that atlanta motor speedways fast three and four wide racing and this will be one of the most exciting marquis events on the nascar schedule
5909169 labor day weekend at atlanta motor speedway at night i cant think of anything better than that
5909170 one of my favorite race tracks is atlanta motor speedway the place is fast sparks are flying and i cant wait for it to happen
5909171 labor day weekend at atlanta motor speedway at night i cant think of anything better than that
5909172 one of my favorite race tracks is atlanta motor speedway the place is fast sparks are flying and i cant wait for it to happen
5909173 its going to be an awesome opportunity for us to really showcase the heat of the south and be able to get out on a racetrack where its really slick really slimy and be able to slide all over the place in this new car were going to be able to have the opportunity to showcase labor day weekend in the south once again and bring it back to where it was originally
5909174 racing under the lights on labor day weekend would be awesome
5909175 its a good weekend just to come out have a barbeque and watch a good race and itd be fun for me because all my family will be around
5909176 i love atlanta motor speedway the site of my first cup series win
5909177 fans have been clamoring for a sprint cup series race under the lights at atlanta motor speedway
5909178 its thrilling to bring labor day racing back to the south on nascars fastest track this will be a great opportunity for atlanta motor speedway to celebrate our 50th year of racing
5909179 this is what would happen during a major earthquake along the mississippi river
5909180 we are providing data points to what is already known about liquefaction in other areas
5909181 some people have an interest in professional and some have a peripheral interest in the items that they purchase
5909182 the history of science is pretty well documented so people know what works are available and thats what they go after
5909183 with scientific books people have some sort of background which leads them to have an interest
5909184 we are so excited to host paula deen this weekend in bristol
5909185 its been an honor to have been associated with smithfield foods for the last four years and we cant wait for paula and michael to arrive at the track and share in the motorsports experience we couldnt have found a better race to bring her to than the food city 250 at bristol motor speedway
5909186 we have been working hard on our bristol car for this weekend
5909187 having paula and her husband in our pits will be very exciting for everyone on our race team
5909188 the uab discussion book project promotes civic involvement respectful dialogue about often controversial issues and more knowledgeable participation in a global society
5909189 field notes from a catastrophe man nature and climate change
5909190 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5909191 most americans still dont know as marshall writes that on the campaign trail mccain frequently forgets key elements of policies gets countries names wrong forgets things hes said only hours or days before and is frequently just confused most americans still dont know it is precisely for this reason that the mccain campaign has now shut down the presss previously unfettered access to the candidate on the straight talk express
5909192 dont forget that tim buckley of ctrl alt del is a known pedophile who sends pictures of his genitals to 14 year old girls
5909193 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5909194 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5909195 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5909196 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5909197 for eight years weve had a vice president who stayed in undisclosed locations trust me its already change we can believe in its just the next vice presidents identity thats undisclosed
5909198 the institutional culture of corruption embraced by the clinton leadership of the democratic party
5909199 unaccountable power for the clintons at the expense of the rule of law and respect for the constitutional processes of government
5909200 especially since it was days after she said she wouldnt take any more money from me
5909201 sen obama needs someone experienced in foreign policy and or running a state or corporation joe biden would be good
5909202 she has the perfect place for a republican platform the washingtonpost com
5909203 if sen barack obama should choose hillary clinton i will stay home on election day and i am not alone
5909204 we confront more than the usual number of people who dont respond or cant respond people are away from their homes heading back from summer vacation or preparing their children for the start of the school year
5909205 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5909206 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5909207 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5909208 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5909209 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5909210 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5909211 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5909212 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5909213 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5909214 to ensure our national security economic prosperity and clean environment by breaking our dependence on foreign oil
5909215 the hands that install roofs can also install solar panels the hands that build todays cars can also build the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles barack obama will create 5 million jobs developing homegrown energy technologies
5909216 one of the most important ways of positioning on global warming is to emphasize the jobs issue since it appeals to people who you might not otherwise reach with your message
5909217 on the big issues that our nation faces some sacrifice will be required not only from you individually but from the nation as a whole there is no magic bullet to our energy problems for example no perfect energy source
5909218 the call to sacrifice for the nations greater good remains an imperative of citizenship sadly in recent years in the midst of a war on two fronts this call to service never came after 9 11 we were asked to shop
5909219 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5909220 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5909221 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5909222 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5909223 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5909224 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5909225 making up your mind questions to consider before the next election
5909226 heres what i want you to do between now and election
5909227 dont just look at issues look at character issues are important but you also have to look at character
5909228 theyre saying im totally self sufficient in myself and nobodys self sufficient enough to be president its too big a job
5909229 rick warren is at the forefront of a kind of younger generation of evangelical protestant leaders who want to have a christian public presence in the culture but who are less tied to the republican politics of their predecessors
5909230 theyre values oriented guys but less convinced that either their own principles or the best politics lies in a total commitment to the republican party
5909231 we are one of those people that make over 250 000 a year and i dont agree that that makes us rich
5909232 even with that kind of income we struggle to pay everything we have gotten ourselves into
5909233 im pretty much a dyed in the wool republican and i was a marine what he went through for five years you gotta hand that to him
5909234 i mean come on whoever buys into that they gotta have a screw loose
5909235 just stay in the senate stay busy learn more foreign policy and come back in ten years obama and i betcha id vote for you
5909236 hes as genuine as can be its just hes a green apple hanging on the tree and mccain is a ripe red apple ready to be picked obama just needs to ripen some more
5909237 barack obama is going to get the same percentage of the religious vote that john kerry and al gore got
5909238 thats christian identity politics and im sure it has some influence but i dont think at the end of the day its the deciding factor
5909239 jimmy carter could have come in here and sounded much more comfortable with his faith but people having seen a jimmy carter presidency would not vote for him just because theyre likely to see him in heaven
5909240 study all the different candidates at every different level you need to register to vote and then you need to vote
5909241 when i hear people say i dont like either of the candidates im just not going to vote i want to say to them well then you need to move to another country because people died for that vote
5909242 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5909243 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5909244 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5909245 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5909246 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5909247 if anyone wonders whether nascar fans can be heard over the roar of the race cars the answer is a definitive yes
5909248 on behalf of california fans i want to thank nascar for making the pepsi 500 a part the chase and giving all of us a chance to participate in the excitement of nascars playoffs
5909249 nascars selection of iowa speedway as a site for a nationwide race next year in only our third full year of competitive racing is an honor and a privilege
5909250 and its also the result of a lot of hard work by the staff here in iowa and our nationwide partners who helped us secure a race here in newton its a great day for iowa speedway for nationwide for nascar and especially for racing fans throughout the country
5909251 iowa speedway is a new facilty that is already very popular with fans in that part of the country and will be a great match for the nascar nationwide series
5909252 the track has successfully hosted nascar camping world series events and we expect to see great racing there on august 1 for the inaugural nascar nationwide series race
5909253 as title sponsor of the nascar nationwide series and an active member of the local community nationwide is pleased nascar has chosen to place a nationwide series race at iowa speedway
5909254 iowa speedway is definitely a first rate facility and we are looking forward to sharing in the excitement of the nascar nationwide series with our 4 000 associates in des moines area along with the entire state of iowa
5909255 and look forward to some of the best racing in the country right here in iowa nascar and nationwide are top notch organizations and were proud to be associated with two world class organizations
5909256 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5909257 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5909258 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5909259 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5909260 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5909261 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5909262 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5909263 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5909264 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5909265 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5909266 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5909267 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5909268 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5909269 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5909270 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5909271 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5909272 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5909273 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5909274 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5909275 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5909276 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5909277 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5909278 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5909279 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5909280 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5909281 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5909282 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5909283 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5909284 hey mister if you dont get those ads off the air in the next 48 hours then your military record and my military record are going to become a major issue in this campaign youve invited it and if you insist on permitting this stuff to continue then its going to be an issue
5909285 i know what im going into here for one thing im black ive got a feisty wife you know i mean we all know what theyre going to try to do here
5909286 look its just a continuation of what ive been doing a very positive approach that so far seems to have done what i hoped it would do and anyway thats the kind of guy i am so well just kind of continue
5909287 ive lost my benefits or i cant get them because my kids got a chronic heart problem or something
5909288 hey if you havent signed up as a precinct or block captain please do so the coordinators theyre ready for you give them your telephone and e mail address and so on and so forth well be in touch with you
5909289 well in the final maybe you did that in the primary dukakis but in the final its all its all this kind of stuff
5909290 get it off the air and i really mean it
5909291 i know what im walking into here i know there are some people who are going to try to take advantage of this but were going to take them on
5909292 well who is this guy anyway youre changing youre moving from here to there everywhere
5909293 hey those attacks that are coming from mccain heres the truth
5909294 look give me a summary of the kinds of things we want to say
5909295 i am married to the next president of the united states
5909296 run for governor ok what do i have to do
5909297 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5909298 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5909299 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5909300 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5909301 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5909302 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5909303 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5909304 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5909305 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5909306 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5909307 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5909308 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5909309 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5909310 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5909311 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5909312 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5909313 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5909314 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5909315 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5909316 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5909317 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5909318 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5909319 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5909320 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5909321 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5909322 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5909323 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5909324 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5909325 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5909326 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5909327 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5909328 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5909329 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5909330 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5909331 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5909332 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5909333 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5909334 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5909335 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5909336 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
5909337 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
5909338 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
5909339 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
5909340 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
5909341 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
5909342 the announcement of our three 2009 national series schedules has some significant news in it
5909343 we think this news and these moves benefit all the industry including the tracks and the teams but most importantly our fans
5909344 you know theres just better cars better engines better everything everything just seems to be going our way now and were getting some breaks and doing things right in the shop not that we were doing them wrong before it just seems like everything is transferring over to finishes now
5909345 hopefully were hitting our stride at the right time and we can carry that into the next three weeks and hopefully onto the chase
5909346 it seems like everybody has closed the gap on the 18 kyle busch obviously theyve been running really good every week but it seems like the 99 carl edwards has been running really well all year
5909347 i feel like weve closed up the gap weve got a little bit more work to do to get to where we need to be but hopefully over the next three weeks we can get everything done that we need to get done on the racetrack and then really throw everything at it for the chase hopefully in an underdog role you dont really have anything to lose so thats hopefully what were looking forward to
5909348 i think theyve done a great job with the race track and just making some of the grooves the first time we went there i think the tires were a little bit too hard and you could run all the way up at the wall
5909349 the last time we went there it was more like the old bristol but you still had a couple options from the bottom to the middle i think once they got the tires squared away the race track kind of came back around and the racing was a lot more normal the last time
5909350 thats almost funny to hear somebody say that because i dont know that there is a tame race at bristol
5909351 i think if everybody is running over the top of each other people are going to complain about that
5909352 i learned from the very first race that you have to be around at the finish to do well at bristol
5909353 it really is a situation of surviving the first 400 laps keeping the fenders on the thing and staying out of the wall then if youre in good shape after four fifths of the race its time to really get down to business during the final 100 laps
5909354 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
5909355 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5909356 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5909357 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5909358 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5909359 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5909360 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5909361 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5909362 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5909363 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5909364 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5909365 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5909366 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5909367 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5909368 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members

5909372 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5909373 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded

5909375 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5909376 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5909377 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5909378 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5909379 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5909380 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5909381 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community

5909384 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5909385 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5909386 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5909387 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5909388 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5909424 the army is too easy for me and i have no reason to get out
5909425 but its really hard to change my military occupational specialty because theres not a lot of people in my mos
5909426 this is completely different than doing anything in normal artillery
5909427 talking to longbow apache helicopter pilots is different than anything else in the artillery branch i have to take into consideration air to ground integration and put myself into the pilots position i have to create a clear picture in their minds before they can attack the enemy
5909428 its great having him because he has training related to artillery rounds
5909429 it helps to have someone who has more knowledge and he can pass it down to my other soldiers as well
5909430 hes extended his time in the army so we know hes committed to doing what hes here for
5909431 it is difficult to believe that he just did that
5909432 we did everything we couldve to prepare after the event last time which was pretty traumatizing really
5909433 he was coming down on the target and probably reacted a little bit to the crowd reaction which is just part of sport youve got to deal with it thats why they play the games it just didnt work he set the gun off before he was ready and thats basically it
5909434 the way i come down into the target i start above the target at 12 oclock and i relax down into the bulls eye
5909435 and as i get into the bulls eye thats when i start to get on the trigger i was coming down just like normal and everything was fine i actually felt really good about the shot and as it was coming in and i was getting on the trigger the gun just went off and it really surprised me
5909436 believe it or not the only thing i was thinking was just calm myself down do the things youve been doing on the past nine shots and then relax and enjoy the shot emmons added
5909437 of course i was a little more nervous than on some of the previous shots but i thought i was really in control
5909438 i was crushed for matt because i know the work hes put in
5909439 he lives with me at the olympic training center we work extremely hard hes had the guts to address 2004 every day since then to make sure he had all the skills he needed to deal with this day today and something didnt work
5909440 i wasnt mad at him just stunned i didnt know what to say
5909441 he demonstrated again just like he did four years ago that hes the worlds best shooter i dont even have words for it yet its just unbelievable
5909442 hes a tough guy and a tough competitor i just sat back there in awe i probably didnt say anything for five minutes
5909443 i never thought i could win an olympic title because there were so many top shooters out there today
5909444 my winning the gold is to a large extent through a little bit of luck
5909445 expecting a gold medal and winning it by that much after 129 shots and then bang gone
5909446 hopefully he can come through it the best way possible hes a strong guy and im sure he will
5909447 theres no question its not going to be easy to get past this and deal with it
5909448 its such a roller coaster in the games three days ago he won an olympic silver medal in one of the best performances ive ever seen all the way through the final 10 shots and he was right on today too
5909449 i mean look at it he had a 3 3 lead and he shoots a shot that he never shoots its like the last olympics its just something ridiculous that never happens and it happens at the last shot in the olympics so it just wasnt meant to be

5909616 i am pleased that the investigation and prosecution of this tragic incident has resulted in conviction of the defendant
5909617 this prosecution is the result of hours of investigation and work by the members of the maryville public safety department and missouri state highway patrol
5909618 as with any case involving people who knew each other the incident involved poor choices and confrontations by both parties to the incident
5909619 for that reason the law provides that an act which caused physical injury but ignores a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death would result is manslaughter
5909620 the law makes the actions of the victim relevant to the response of the decision making by the defendant
5909621 by this plea the family is assured that the matter is concluded we have avoided the appeal that would have followed any conviction at trial and the same result occurred had an actual trial been held

5909672 product differentiation these days is very low for example there are numerous different brands selling mp3 players on the market yet despite this they are all almost the same similar features similar price theres nothing thats gives one an edge over the other so what are they using as leverage brand loyalty

5909805 we saw in 1980 that whenever threats are used as political leverage when discussing a boycott of the olympics the only real victims are the athletes
5909806 thankfully talk of a boycott did not lead to one at the 2008 olympic games the stories of heartache and disappointment chronicled in boycott prove that whenever politics and the olympics intersect seldom does it prove to be a good mix
5909807 boycott uniquely and poignantly captures the impact of american athletes denied the opportunity to compete in the olympic games nearly three decades later i continue to appreciate and understand their heartbreak and anger thanks to the authors we are reminded of their brave but painful sacrifice this book then becomes their belated but deserved olympic salute
5909808 the boycott of 1980 was a stunning experience because i thought in our country the individuals had the right to make their choices in sport it is reassuring that the caracciolis decided to tackle this story about and american athletes in a challenging time

5909829 bigwig did i see the valet driving a c class mercedes for you
5909830 you know we at mega law just added an executive sauna for partners with a swedish masseuse and we have a special relationship with mercedes benz plus we have just hired some oil and gas experts to beef up our practice we can help you provide oil co with more legal services than your current firm could hope to provide of course we would make sure you were getting a larger piece of the pie than those less industrious than you we know how to reward rainmakers
5909831 hey now that youre playing hardball i want my fair share from all the years you denied me my full compensation and you never reimbursed me for that 600 bottle of champagne i sprung for at the client dinner after we completed their merger in 02 i am going to tally it all up and sue
5909832 our partner of 20 years bigwig has announced his decision to leave those of us who stood by him when he was a wee cog he inherited oil co as a client from one of our original named partners mr big bigwig is now seeking to sever not only a long term relationship with our firm but also to take from us a long term institutional client it saddens us but we will seek compensation for this loss we are not completely surprised in recent years bigwig has demonstrated an increasing lack of good judgment coupled with some dangerous indulgences his departure is probably for the best we just hope oil co will return home after realizing it was biglaw and not bigwig who was providing the legal services that kept it making record profits in a time of economic crisis we will chug forward with our loyal partners and clients and build a bigger and better tomorrow
5909833 is a fantasy dreamed up by sherwin williams and their lawyers
5909834 it seems hard for the state to say the taxpayers shouldnt have to bear the burden of paying the costs when they have a contract that should force motley rice to pick up the tab
5909835 martin and bernice have taken various actions that were antithetical to the goals of the king center and inconsistent with their fiduciary duties as directors of the king center
5909836 i think its great that weve at least gotten some response
5909837 any filing that will help expedite the unification of this family is great in my view
5909838 in opposition to the stated goals of the king center
5909839 as when he commandeered a reception being hosted on behalf of the king center and turned it into his own wedding reception
5909840 in direct conflict with her duties to the king center
5909841 wiping out poverty and injustice through programs that foster peace and nonviolent social change
5909842 the king center was unable after numerous attempts over a long period of time to convince martin and bernice to stop using the king center for their own personal gain
5909843 the king center is a charitable tax exempt organization and it had to take action to protect its tax exempt status and to ensure that no individual profits personally from resources that should be dedicated to the foundation
5909844 all five of the heirs of dr king signed a contract assigning to the estate all rights they had related to dr king including their own personal rights arising from their own relationships with dr king
5909845 the purpose of the contract was to insure that dr kings legacy would be managed consistently and cohesively these two heirs are now ignoring that binding contract and are using property of the estate to advance their own personal agendas
5909846 well settled that when a statute is concerned with a continuing offense the ex post facto clause is not violated by application of a statute to an enterprise that began prior to but continues after the effective date of the statute
5909847 stated that even in the case of a continuing offense if it was possible for the jury who had not been given instructions on the date of the enactment to convict exclusively on pre enactment conduct then the conviction constitutes a violation of the ex post facto clause
5909848 is foreclosed by our decision in torres where we held that a retrial is necessary whenever there is any possibility no matter how likely that the jury could have convicted based exclusively on pre enactment conduct
5909849 you have this unique situation where some conduct occurred after the enactment of the statute and some conduct occurred before and to the courts credit they said we cant tell which may have played a more dynamic role in the defendants conviction
5909850 usually you are going back and going though all of the same evidence again
5909851 here there will be a significant quantity of evidence that will be excluded which could affect the outcome of the case
5909852 the fda has promulgated no regulation concerning the risk posed by mercury in fish or warnings for that risk has adopted no rule precluding states from imposing a duty to warn and has taken no action establishing mercury warnings as misbranding under federal law or as contrary to federal law in any other respect
5909853 balance out the negative information with positive information about the numerous healthy attributes of canned tuna
5909854 the fda took no action to preclude state warnings at least no binding action via ordinary regulatory procedures
5909855 the fdas regulatory scheme is the result of over 10 years of data collection and study
5909856 the mere fact that the fda chose to warn only certain at risk consumers rather than all consumers does not create a conflict
5909857 the advisory does recommend continued fish consumption within certain parameters but that recommendation is clearly not inconsistent with a warning against excess consumption
5909858 while the fda may well have the authority to promulgate a regulatory scheme which would preclude any state duty to warn consumers of the risks of mercury in tuna it simply has not done so
5909859 courts have declined to permit agencies to promulgate express pre emption decisions by informal letter
5909860 no reason to doubt that the fda has studied the risks of mercury in fish
5909861 made no conclusive determination of the sort which will pre empt state law neither that mercury in fish poses no adverse health consequences nor to prohibit some or all warnings
5909862 is not pre empted whenever an agency has merely studied or considered an issue
5909863 the cases leave no doubt that a mere decision not to regulate in this case a decision not to require a federal methylmercury warning alone will not pre empt state law
5909864 spoke to a lawyer last night and they said that if you made that statement under deress sic that they can not hold you to that and thats all you have to do is call the prosecutor and tell him the statement was made under deress sic and that it is not true and that is what you will say if they make you testife sic in front of a grand jury
5909865 calling eoannou as a defense witness would have put eoannou and lana between the proverbial rock and a hard place
5909866 however by not calling eoannou to the witness stand lana gave up potentially beneficial testimony for his client lana in short may have been conflicted
5909867 the district court should then consider whether any aspect of that professional relationship including the possible desire to avoid scrutiny of it may have influenced lanas decision to not call eoannou as a witness at ventrys trial

5909883 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5909884 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5909885 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the to the bloodstream
5909886 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5909887 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs

5909899 i appreciate that some of these issues in playgrounds for instance within 10 metres of childrens play equipment are going to be difficult
5909900 but im a great believer in the educative effect of legislation
5909901 we were told that when we banned smoking in pubs and clubs two years ago that people wouldnt comply that there would be civil disobedience
5909902 that hasnt happened and i think the public will be the greatest enforcer of these bans i think you will find the public will warm to these bans in the interests of public health
5909903 i would be very hesitant to simply say we would go down this very extreme position that mr mcgintys taken
5909904 id say in confined spaces you shouldnt smoke but out in the open air as long as youre not impacting directly on other people i dont know that we need to be so restrictive and encourage such a nanny state as jim mcginty would have it
5909905 lets have a bit of faith in people to do the right thing and not try and demonise people because they might smoke
5909906 we know its bad for their health and they know its bad for their health and lets not demonise them
5909907 i recognised that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being

5909910 the concern is basically for a loss of effect for drugs and particularly those used in serious medical conditions
5909911 these are three serious medical conditions for which the drugs simply have to work properly
5909912 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5909913 and we have only a very rudimentary understanding of what these pumps do and what drugs they affect and what other drugs or foods might modulate these pumps
5909914 theres a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the implications are for the average person
5909915 the best thing to do in general to get the most consistent effect of your drug is to take it with a glass of water on an empty stomach
