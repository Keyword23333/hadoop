4820092 the extension of the community of equals to include all great apes human beings chimpanzees bonobos gorillas and orang utans
4820093 the community of equals is the moral community within which we accept certain basic moral principles or rights as governing our relations with each other and enforceable at law
4820094 of course the purpose of this isnt to merely improve the treatment of great apes which could be accomplished as it already has been in some places via normal animal welfare statutes
4820095 judeo christian philosophy goes to the guillotine allowing the utilitarian agenda to proceed unhindered leading in turn to the moral value of the weak and vulnerable among us becoming archaic resulting in their loss of the right to life and being used instrumentally for those deemed more valuable
4820096 in order to bring a nation to support the burdens of great military establishments it is necessary to create an emotional state akin to psychology there must be the portrayal of external menace this involves the development of a nation hero nation villain ideology and the arousing of the population to a sense of sacrifice

4820111 california public school students are continuing to make solid steady progress learning the skills and concepts necessary for success in school and in life since 2003 532 494 more california students have become proficient in english language arts and 415 129 more students have become proficient in math while we still have a lot of work to do to reach our goal of universal proficiency this years gains are particularly encouraging considering they build upon five years of steady growth
4820112 the results also show significant increases in science and social science california has some of the highest standards in the nation and i am exceptionally proud of the hard work and dedication of our students teachers administrators paraprofessionals and parents that led to this achievement
4820113 while we celebrate the progress made by all subgroups of students over the last five years we can not lose sight of the fact that more than half of our students and too many students of color are still not meeting our high standards
4820114 it is good news that all students continue to improve it is imperative that we help those students who have historically struggled the most to accelerate their learning so they may effectively and fully participate in school the workforce and in society
4820115 it is a moral and economic imperative that we close the achievement gap california cannot afford to allow our latino students and our african american students to continue to lag academically behind their peers
4820116 while we must close the gap that exists between all subgroups i am acutely concerned about our african american students african american students as a whole scored in english language arts just one point above latino students a subgroup that includes a significant number of english learners this coupled with an alarming dropout rate among african americans indicates a crisis in the education of black children
4820117 my statewide p 16 council has made a series of recommendations aimed at closing the achievement gap and improving the way we provide education services to african american students we must redouble our efforts to find and share effective strategies that will help african american students succeed

4820127 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4820128 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government

4820432 jo heeft in dat interview een oude code doorbroken het is een publiek geheim dat de bedoelde inbraken door onkruit zijn gepleegd en dat wijnand daarin een organiserende rol vervulde maar nooit heeft iemand precies uit de doeken willen doen wie er welke rol vervuld heeft enerzijds omdat het niet om de persoon ging maar om de actie anderzijds omdat niemand een ander er bij wilde lappen

4820446 its true once its on the internet the networks who are already feeling like theyre falling behind in information gathering because the internet is more instantaneous have to respond
4820447 i dont see youtube affecting what the networks air on tv anytime soon
4820448 network news is far more beholden to viewer calls network affiliate sensibilities and most importantly the fccs restrictions on what can be broadcast than it is to youtube for the time being internet video is not really a strong substitute for broadcast tv very few consumers say they are watching less tv because they are watching more internet instead video on the net is a complement to video on tv
4820449 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here

4820455 breaking news kim kardashian to sue over sex tape release iranian american girl had this to say about the effect of kardashians popularity on middle eastern populations in the united states i am also one of the few middle eastern people who is appalled at the fact that many middle eastern girls are acting like low class trash to get attention or to attain celebrity status armenians have theirs kim kardashian and we have ours which is unfortunate aylar dianati look at the striking resemblences of these two women pitch black hair dark skin short in stature fake plastic boobs and of course hideous without makeup the west uses these as examples of middle eastern beauty quite sickening for those who dont know any better i would like to say that we have real beauty in armenian and iranian societies and these women are not in that category
4820456 good call on middle eastern women there isnt enough appreciation and recognition of the beauty of the females of that geographic region
4820457 that chick kim kardashian and her sisters some of the ugliest humans in southern california
4820458 overlook the garbage and verbal vomit that regularly comes out of their mouths it makes them ugly imo

4820467 im really glad to see what we did because the defense has been getting the best of us and kicking our tails so far
4820468 we still have a long way to go but our pass protection was better we didnt drop balls and willie was pretty sharp
4820469 i think willie was as sharp as he has ever been in camp
4820470 i have to give all the credit to the offensive line when they are protecting me like they did it makes my job so much easier
4820471 when you dont play on edge on defense like we have been playing in camp you arent going to be as successful
4820472 our defense didnt come with the enthusiasm and excitement that we had

4820480 i dont know you see my father was raised in kenya but his friends were not so english expat more kenyan gansters heads of cid owners of crocodile villages even he dad i thought was a pilot worked as a spy i snagged a man who is half scottish half kenyan and each day he amazes me in our simalarities and differences as vast as the oceans i love the green hills of england the high hills of the carribean and the hills that fell into a long fist shape that are imortalised in karen blixens story i dreamed of africa although this is not a blog about another expat living in africa with five staff to tend to their needs so they may fix their husband a gin and tonic with the children safely tucked up in bed by the two nannies it is incredible and hard all at once to be no longer part of any society but on the fringes of many i think geography is the closest i come to feeling at home london bridge and the tate fill me up like dyon warwicks you fill up my senses or like champagne bubbles as they hit the back of your throat so do crickets singing at night and the deep bellied laughter of africans magnificence of culture and architecture i left africa when i was six i came back and forth but not to a city to the mara the famous mara and bathed in rivers infested with crocodiles and hippos this is rather more an old monied thing to do and i dont believe i would do it now at all having been coconned by my african family i lived in england with a count my step father who i loved but never felt english always always strangely in limbo i can fly in and out belonging to no place looking at the good and the bad the materalism and the generosity i can weave a common thread together and find extraordinary strands of life but like my husband and his brother we belong to no group throughly

4820521 europe in the summer of 1914 enjoyed a peaceful productivity so dependent on international exchange and co operation that a belief in the impossibility of a general war seemed the most conventional of wisdoms in 1910 an analysis of prevailing economic interdependence the great illusion had become a best seller its author norman angell had demonstrated to the satisfaction of almost all informed opinion that the disruption of international credit inevitably to be caused by war would either deter its outbreak or bring it speedily to an end

4820531 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4820532 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4820533 this book reminded me of two things both very disconnected the old time movie serials where the heroine is always left in utmost peril until the next sequence and p g wodehouse
4820534 a marvelous study of character especially the dogs and has some of the funniest writing ive ever read in the genre
4820535 like wodehouse englert often throws off phrases that you want to reread just for the sheer pleasure of it
4820536 i started setting up blogs for myself and clients in 2003 i think maybe earlier
4820537 prior to my joining the firm the company launched a blog in 2006
4820538 i instituted the first blogger only campaign for a large client
4820539 my firm had been using social media previously but i began with my first experience a campaign to reach out to bloggers and monitor coverage in blogs 2006
4820540 ive also utilized basic social networking as part of my offerings though the maintenance of those tools has not been kept up
4820541 we started setting up myspace pages for some clients in 2005 probably
4820542 in 2008 we also helped drive exposure to a sponsorship of one of my clients through social media tools in order to downplay the corporate feel of the sponsorship itself this was accomplished through the creation of profiles on the sponsored individual on forums and blog portals targeting our vertical and primary media targets
4820543 in 2005 we hired a company to do travel podcasts for our web site
4820544 last year 2007 a client created a video they intended to distribute virally other clients continue to do the same
4820545 our company is looking for ways to add social media to client campaigns and encouraging clients to adopt social media tools the biggest roadblock to the use of social media is lack of understanding of clients need for education and developing measurement tools
4820546 we are building social media for a number of clients and using it for our own promotion and relationships
4820547 increased usage but the fire will be very slow to spread
4820548 there will be many bad case studies of poor uses of social media but also many other case studies showing great usage clients will continue to become more informed and measurement reporting tools will become more sophisticated or at least better understood
4820549 as meta social media increase eventually all of our electronic lives will be inextricably linked successful companies will embrace and exploit these connections while others will flounder trying to fight the inevitable
4820550 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
4820551 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4820552 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
4820553 theres even some evidence that al maliki wants to start a fight with the sons of iraq
4820554 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point
4820555 if the negotiations crash and burn i will be forced to pull out all u s troops by jan 1

4820557 we ran over 100 plays and were at the point where i know what they can do
4820558 he was coached well in high school im not sure he played as well today as he has in practice
4820559 what the oilers need to do here is have a really big shift
4820560 the only person i can compare myself to is adrian peterson when coach johnson was at georgia southern
4820561 were pretty much the same back and the same type
4820562 when i was at the naval academy i can promise you we played maryland wake forest n c state duke rutgers boston college notre dame pittsburgh and theyre on the same level as we are its not like they werent in the same division or the same level so thats why i dont buy that
4820563 i mean as soon as you lose a game thats going to be the reason everybody has their opinion and we will see what happens
4820564 i find it amusing really its past the point of anything else other than being amusing to me
4820565 in my mind over the span of time we have proven the offense will work at a lot of different schools
4820566 when we heard about him i did a little research myself and saw that navy receivers didnt have as many catches as were used to getting
4820567 im pretty sure hes just saying that to trick people
4820568 in the spring it took us a long time before we could kind of get it down on defense and know what we were doing
4820569 we had three or four weeks to practice for it but during the season teams are going to get maybe a few days thats going to be our biggest advantage i think its going to work
4820570 most of what were going to be doing is going as fast as we can no matter what the defensive lineman does
4820571 it gives you a chance to open yourself up and go all out full speed every play and i think that could lead to good stuff
4820572 the good thing about guys being young is they are going to be here for a while and theyll get better and better as they play
4820573 right now im concerned about this year this is the year i care about and the first game im not worried about next year or the future anybody who knows me im competitive i want to win right now
4820574 one thing youre going to know how coach johnson feels
4820575 it wont catch you by surprise thats something you have to respect hes going to be vocal hes going to let you know whether youre doing things right or youre doing things wrong
4820576 hes a coach who understands this game also involves some psychology no matter how much you want to say its just played on the field you have to get into the mind of the player and use that to your advantage

4820623 many of the black rage paragraphs obama wrote in dreams from my father bear a striking resemblance to passages frantz fanon wrote in his first book black skin white masks
4820624 ray assured me that we would never talk about whites without knowing exactly what we were doing without knowing that there might be a price to pay
4820625 for several years certain laboratories have been trying to produce a serum for denegrification
4820626 frantz fanons revolutionary writings were instrumental in shaping obamas own political analysis of race
4820627 we do not know if obama senior ever shared fanons writings with his son but much of the expression of black resentment obama offers in dreams from my father appears strongly influenced by fanons pages
4820628 obama railed against the same forms of racial oppression his father must have felt under british colonialism
4820629 the use of change as a political slogan dates back to socialist saul alinsky and his desire to cause a radical redistribution of income from the haves to the have nots in america
4820630 obama has borrowed phrases freely even from movies taking bamboozled from spike lees movie about malcolm x and the phrase he is the one from the matrix movie series
4820631 is a plagiarist plain and simple he cannot be trusted

4820637 aqu el alma est de pie y de ese modo se cruza el bombardeo anterior con este
4820638 porque algunas son reacias a tener que pasar por la experiencia terrena a fin de eliminar a n algunos residuos lo cual es necesario para no tener que vivir ya m s en la tierra pero en algunos casos raros ha ocurrido un accidente
4820639 en el viaje que hacen las almas para conocer lugares en que quieren vivenciar sus experiencias futuras e incluso por mera curiosidad no pueden sobrepasar el l mite de seguridad del campo magn tico de ese cuerpo celeste pero cuando cometen alg n fallo de c lculo son aspiradas por la energ a de ese cuerpo celeste y en este caso no hay vuelta tendr n que pasar por todo el proceso vigente en ese cuerpo celeste que en la tierra va desde la fecundaci n hasta la llamada muerte que es cuando podr n volver a su galaxia de origen
4820640 i think people need to get off this crap of helping people
4820641 progressive for me cause the little poor people will surrender their money so i can get richer by giving them this brilliant genius hard to oppose bullshit
4820642 interestingly obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather missing from the dedication are the grandparents who raised him in hawaii
4820643 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book
4820644 in the introduction that he wrote after this was going with the second book and the original book had no dedication page and this is not the typical way that you dedicate a book so im making the distinction there is no dedication page in the book at all never has been
4820645 never states precisely how many wives his father had or how many half brothers and sisters he has from different mothers
4820646 sayid obama was not even sure how many wives his brother had
4820647 obama blames racism for breaking up his parents marriage not his fathers polygamist ways
4820648 obama is again lying about history to claim jfk had anything to do with bringing his father to the united states to study
4820649 obama senior following the prescripts of islamic sharia law divorced
4820650 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond
4820651 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4820652 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family
4820653 what would be heard by most listeners is that obama hates the military so much that he might leave the united states defenseless against our enemies
4820654 i did not see my brother practice islam especially after he came back from his studies in the united states
4820655 there is no doubt obama senior was a muslim by birth and upbringing
4820656 obama did attend a government run public school in indonesia and he did receive islamic instruction including study of the koran
4820657 barack obama is not and never has been a muslim
4820658 that physical description does not match the indonesia television news videos showing the house
4820659 it is hard to decipher what obama might be trying to hide by not being clear about the specific location of the houses where he lived in jakarta
4820660 the black man who tried to peel off his skin
4820661 advertisements in the negro magazines still hymn nadinola skin bleach lightens and brightens skin
4820662 the entire episode suggests what psychologists call hypothetical lying in other words imagining something that has not happened but imagining it with so much precise detail that the made up memory functions for the person as if it were real
4820663 has obama lost the ability to tell the difference between something that actually happened and something he invented
4820664 after the date obama wants us to think he left indonesia
4820665 the puzzle just adds to the growing list of factual discrepancies or outright fabrications that obama manufactures very likely on an ongoing basis
4820666 if we cant trust you to remember which magazine you read in indonesia when you were 9 how can we possibly ever trust you to protect our country
4820667 i came here to prove that im the best in the world and i did that
4820668 and got a response in just a couple minutes pretty cool really large pic
4820669 he was very embarrassed when we got him down and his colleagues were waiting for him
4820670 with it being burnleys first game of the season at home the crowd werent very happy with it being delayed
4820671 you have a style of writing i just cant do
4820672 we all feel let down and powerless this is the georgian communitys way of making a point that the british governments powder puff and pathetic attempts to bring peace has not gone unnoticed we have seen all words and no teeth
4820673 this has been organised alongside similar gatherings in prague berlin frankfurt paris and chicago the point of this is that there are many western countries who should feel responsible for assisting
4820674 shes explored the church of scientology she tried kabbalah and now this i think its just another phase but either way shes involving god in her life and im happy about that
4820675 its been an eventful day and so many things happen you just try and block it all out and focus on your ride and focus on your performance and thats what i did and to finish with one two on the podium thats just unbelievable
4820676 you have to stay focused and not get overexcited by it all we expected it was possible with the kind of form everyone has had and now the standard in the team is such that if you get in the team youre going to be a realistic medal chance thats just the way it is
4820677 but if you get too excited you watch someone like bradley going up to the podium right before the keirin final i didnt look at him or the flag i didnt want to look at the emotion on his face because i knew that would set me off
4820678 i was just trying to show a little bit of respect by standing up when the ceremony was on but i was trying to block it out of my mind as much as possible because again its about the process of the performance
4820679 today when more children are overweight compared with previous generations it can be harder for parents to objectively identify if their child is overweight
4820680 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight some research showed that only 10 of parents with overweight or obese children described their child as overweight
4820681 this has been an extraordinary day of achievement by our athletes in beijing
4820682 i have not really been able to think about it it has been such a whirlwind and i just need to sit down and take it all in
4820683 so who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here it is not only those people who perpetrate them who are responsible but also those people who failed to stop them
4820684 yeah i can quickly answer any question of the form
4820685 this consequence is a challenge and how will you rise to the occassion
4820686 go with the flow of present energy and use that current energy to make another choice that will propel you in a different direction or will you throw a tantrum ball into a corner aim your internal anger at others in an attempt to dim away your illusion of isolation
4820687 our frustration does not so much come from the problems in our lives but our beliefs about our
4820688 later i realized that the mission had to end in a let down because the real barrier wasnt in the sky but in our knowledge and experience of supersonic flight

4820716 the baltic sea is a connecting sea to the north sea fish and the whale could have easily followed the current flowing into the baltic sea
4820717 it is also possible that the whale became confused because of underwater noises

4820749 if that pipeline were destroyed or controlled by russia european energy supplies would be even more vulnerable to russian influence
4820750 one disruption of supply abroad can suddenly raise energy prices inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers and in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4820751 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore
4820752 i am determined to celebrate this occasion despite all the hardships such as heat and security concerns
4820753 i feel that the situation is better now because i notice that there is more security i am happy to be here today
4820754 i hope that these measures will prevent the terrorists from carrying attacks and bombings in the holy city

4820760 his plan would not raise any taxes on couples making less than 250 000 a year nor on any single person with income under 200 000
4820761 amounts to a war on two income families a marriage penalty of punitive proportions if those two single persons with income under 200 000 get married mr obama is going to hammer them with a huge tax increase if the second earner who in many cases is the woman is going to have to give 54 of what she earns to the government she might as well stay home with the children mr obama may be able to get away with symbolic slights to women such as not picking senator clinton as vice president but punishing them with confiscatory taxes for participating in the workforce at a high income level moves the slight into the realm of substance
4820762 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated

4820768 yes i hear you im sorry that you were disappointed
4820769 i am surrounded by self absorbed teenagers or adults that think they can write better books and never do
4820770 s deu tempo de trocar de roupa enfiar a touca os culos e embrulhar a medalha na jaqueta
4820771 tento dormir o suficiente me alimentar o suficiente e treinar o mais que posso al m disso h outras coisas que me favorecem como a rela o que tenho com o meu treinador e sim claro o jeito como eu nasci

4820773 i would like to take the time to tell everyone who might care
4820774 se a atriz do batman n o a mesma do homem aranha
4820775 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4820776 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4820777 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4820778 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4820779 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4820780 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4820781 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4820782 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4820783 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4820784 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4820785 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4820786 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4820787 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4820813 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4820814 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4820815 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4820816 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4820817 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

4820827 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4820828 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4820829 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

4820861 being able to express myself and my journey through my music is a feeling i cant describe

4820868 una parte cay junto al camino y fue pisoteada y las aves del cielo se la comieron
4820869 y aqu llos a lo largo del camino son los que han o do pero despu s viene el diablo y arrebata la palabra de sus corazones para que no crean y se salven

4820964 politics is not only for politicians it is for all of us only thus can we build up a politically conscious and politically educated public jealous and watchful of its rights and ever ready to work live and fight for them the malaya of the past was a perfect model of political inertia consequent on the corruption of riches this must not be so again remember that only a politically restless public can ensure progress and can goad the powers that be into granting reforms
4820965 politik bukan hanya untuk ahli potilik ianya untuk kita semua hanya demikian baru kita berupaya untuk membina satu masyarakat dengan kesedaran dan kebijaksaan politik yang berwaspada dan berjaga jaga terhadap hak mereka dan bersedia pada setiap masa untuk bekerja bergerak dan berjuang untuk hak tersebut malaya di masa lalu merupakan satu contoh terbaik ketandusan politik hasil dari ketaksuban mengejar kemewahan dan kekayaan keadaan ini tak sepatutnya berterusan ingatlah bahawa masyarakat dengan semangat politik yang berkobar sajalah yang dapat memastikan kemajuan dan berupaya mendesak pihak yang berkuasa untuk melaksanakan perubahan
4820966 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian
4820967 and i was just thinking about the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4820968 i was so happy for her but i couldnt celebrate that i had to get prepared for my match and stay focused
4820969 they worked so hard for us to have a better life theres five of us kids that they had to raise and support
4820970 my dad was a carpenter for a while he kind of worked odd jobs then he worked at a sawmill my mom she waitressed and then eventually they owned a small 12 room motel in hazelton b c
4820971 my parents always worked hard to be able to support their family and make sure that they had a better life than what they had
4820972 i think its very special to them and to me obviously that they be here and be able to see such an accomplishment and for me to reach my dream
4820973 to get from somewhere really small and have your daughter succeed in such a huge way what can you do but just be really really proud
4820974 its interesting you know being refugee status and going across indonesia and being there for eight months and what they had to do
4820975 and the ordeal of trying to get out of vietnam i think was huge in part i think now later on in life where we are adults and we can connect with our parents
4820976 its easier to understand and theyve basically opened up and let us know
4820977 i knew that i had to set the pace set the tone and make sure that i wrestled my match and not just wait around to see what she was going to do
4820978 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
4820979 i was allowing her to dictate the pace of the match

4820981 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4820982 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4820983 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4820984 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4820985 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4820986 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4820987 it is no good when assistance comes to dead people poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of knock on wood any possible conflict
4820988 saying that the union will have a common policy toward russia is laughable

4821080 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4821081 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4821082 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4821083 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4821084 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4821085 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4821086 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4821087 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4821088 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4821089 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4821090 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4821091 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4821092 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4821093 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4821094 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more

4821098 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4821099 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4821100 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race

4821143 there will be no weapons or authority in lebanon other than that of the lebanese state
4821144 someone described hezbollah like the a team of terrorists in terms of capabilities in terms of range of weapons they have in terms of internal discipline to be honest they make al qaeda look like a minor league team
4821145 apart from un troops lebanese soldiers and local hunters no one is armed south of the litani river
4821146 unifil is getting intelligence from the lebanese army and lebanese army intelligence officers are collaborators with hezbollah
4821147 at a minimum graziano says hezbollah is one of the parties that agree with 1701 and support 1701 this is factually untrue as evidenced by hezbollahs armed offensive with impunity against the lebanese government and citizenry in may
4821148 graziano adds unifil has no commitment to the disarmament of hezbollah we are a peacekeeping force not peace enforcement this is contradictory to say the least and proof that unifil is a hollow force in lebanon
4821149 let us not forget that nasrallah has openly stated that hezbollah maintains its weapons no matter whether they are located south or north of the litani river and will use them anytime we hezbollah wish
4821150 therefore there is no indication that hezbollah has been disarmed
4821151 hezbollah is also terrorizing lebanese civilians in south lebanon often within eyesight and earshot of unifil troops and unifil never initiates any investigation whatsoever
4821152 for instance when hezbollah attacked across the country in may 2008 the organizations fighters ransacked the offices of the mufti of tyre and jabal amel unifil did absolutely nothing to either prevent this act or investigate it after the fact

4821175 do you work in a traditional way do you make traditional arts and crafts do you make decoratives or calligraphs
4821176 so you are an artist did you know something about art when you were in your country or did you learn it here

4821181 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4821182 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4821183 we take it one step at a time all we can do is focus on the smaller picture
4821184 we cant let ourselves get overwhelmed it takes away from playing hard and playing smart

4821190 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4821191 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4821192 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4821193 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4821194 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4821195 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4821196 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4821197 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4821198 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4821199 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4821200 oh well were still trying to hear from that guy we emailed him

4821204 het veroveren van de aarde wat meestal betekent dat ze wordt afgepakt van mensen met een andere huidskleur of met iets plattere neuzen dan wij is geen fraaie aangelegenheid wanneer je het van al te dichtbij bekijkt wat het rechtvaardigt is enkel en alleen het imperialisme als idee
4821205 sie k nnen sich nicht vertreten sie m ssen vertreten werden
4821206 it is true that there have been great philosophers among the muslim peoples and that some of them were arabs but they were rare exceptions the arab mind whether in relation to the outer world or in relation to the processes of thought cannot throw off its intense feeling for the separateness and the individuality of concrete events i believe one of the main factors lying behind that lack of a sense of law which professor macdonald regarded as the characteristic difference in the oriental it is this too which explains what is so difficult for the western student to grasp until it is explained to him by the orientalists the aversion of the muslims from the thought processes of rationalism the rejection of rationalist modes of thought and the utilitarian ethic which is inseparable from them as its roots therefore not in the so called obscurantism of the muslim theologians but in the atomism and directness of the arab imagination
4821207 the modern middle east and north africa is not a center of great cultural achievement nor is it likely to become one in the near future the study of the region or its languages therefore does not constitute its own reward so far as modern culture is concerned
4821208 in the arabic speaking countries a different word was for revolution thawra the root th w r in classical arabic meant to rise up e g of a camel to be stirred or excited and hence especially in mahgribi usage to rebel
4821209 lewiss association of thawra with a camel rising and generally with excitement and not with a struggle on behalf of values hints much more broadly than is usual for him that arab is scarcely more than a sexual neurotic being
4821210 let us recapitulate them here one is the absolute and systematic difference between the west which is rational developed humane superior and the orient which is aberrant undeveloped inferior
4821211 on a visit to beirut during the terrible war of 1975 1976 a french journalist wrote regretfully of the gutted downtown area that it had once seemed to belong to the orient of chateaubriand and nerval he was right about the place of course especially so far a european was concerned the orient was almost a european invention and had been since antiquity a place of romance exotic beings haunting memories and landscapes remarkable experiences now it was disappearing in a sense it had happened its time was over

4821215 de wreedheid van het irakese baathisme werd plotseling zichtbaar en maakte de meest grove emoties los onder hen die zich geroepen voelden het woord te doen
4821216 aan de andere kant van de atlantische oceaan bekritiseerde edward said republic of fear als een project dat diende om de stelling te verbreiden dat vetes en geweld in het midden oosten te wijten zijn aan relatief gezien prehistorische oorzaken die in de genen van deze mensen de arabieren zijn verankerd edward said is hoogleraar aan de columbia university en wellicht de meest prominente arabische intellectueel van het westelijk halfrond samir al khalil zei hij in een interview over de golfoorlog was in feite een proefkonijn getuige die de rol van autochtone informant op zich had genomen maar daarmee in feite de belangen van amerikaanse beleidsmakers diende in zulke woorden ligt meer wanhoop en hopeloosheid besloten dan in een hele bibliotheek met boeken gewijd aan de wreedheid van dictators in het midden oosten en de verschrikkelijke prijs die mensen betalen voor hun oorlogen politiek actief zijn en de zin van politieke actie in de arabische wereld willen heroveren betekent weigeren een gevangene van dit soort taal te worden
4821217 it is benighted to say that orientalism is a conspiracy or to suggest that the west is evil both are among the fatuities that lewis and one of his epigones the iraqi publicist kanan makiya have had the temerety to ascribe to me
4821218 de bewering dat irak zijn eigen burgers vergaste is vaak herhaald dit is op zijn best onzeker er is tenminste een rapport van het war college dat werd opgesteld toen irak nog een bondgenoot van de v s was dat beweert dat de gifgasaanval tegen de koerden in halabdja het werk was van iran er zijn tegenwoordig maar weinig mensen die melding maken van zulke berichten in de media
4821219 no sooner had the arab muslim world said farewell to the wrath and passion of the ayatollah khomeinis crusade than an other contender rose in bagdad the new claimant was made of material different from the turbaned saviour from qum saddam hussayn was not a writer of treatises in islamic government nor a product of high learning in religious seminaries not for him were the drawn out ideological struggles for the hearts and minds of the faithful he came from a brittle land a frontier country between persia and arabia with little claim to culture and books and grand ideas the new contender was a despot a ruthless and skilled warden who had tamed his domain and turned it into a large prison
4821220 brittle land with a little claim to culture books and new ideas
4821221 the tragedy which burst in the worlds consciousness during the exodus of april 1991 will mark the collective memory of the kurdish people for a long time to come kurdish history will remain divided into before and after the anfal western audiences are thus being given the opportunity to discover an artistic witness to one of the most tragic episode of the century a century which invited genocide and which has been particularly rich in massacres and mass atrocities dictated by fanaticism intolerance racism and other ideological delusions
4821222 in een tijd dat grote delen van de rest van de wereld oost europa latijns amerika china zuid afrika de mensenrechten en de democratie begonnen te ontdekken en het gevecht aangingen met de dictaturen van eigen bodem en de stalinistische bureaucratie n waren de beste en begaafdste palestijnen bezig geleerde boeken te schrijven die berustten op verklaringen als alle academische kennis over india en egypte is op de een of andere manier bevlekt met en gevormd door dit grove politieke feit het imperialisme dat is wat ik beweer in deze studie van het ori ntalisme het is daarom juist dat elke europeaan in alles wat hij maar over de ori nt te zeggen had derhalve een racist imperialist en bijna een totaal etnocentrist was edward saids boek orientalism was een intellectueel project dat een hele generatie jonge arabische wetenschappers be nvloedde het bepaalde in de jaren tachtig ook de inhoud van westers universitair onderzoek naar het midden oosten het oorspronkelijke boek is nooit als kritiek op de huidige arabische politiek bedoeld geweest maar voedde de ingewortelde populistische rancunepolitiek tegen het westen de in dat boek geanalyseerde verdraaiing van de werkelijkheid van het midden oosten dateerde uit de achttiende en negentiende eeuw maar werd door jonge arabische en pro arabische wetenschappers omgesmeed tot een intellectuele en politieke agenda die geen voeling had met de werkelijke behoeften van de arabieren die leefden immers in een wereld waar de wreedheid en niet het imperialisme hand over hand toenam
4821223 nationalism is love before anything else he who loves doesnt ask for reasons and if he were to ask he would not find them he who cannot love except for a clear reason has already had this love wither away in himself and die
4821224 edward said is hypocriet op een symposium aan de universiteit van amsterdam verklaarde hij dat de arabische wereld in het westen te negatief wordt afgeschilderd toen ik hem na afloop onder vier ogen sprak zei hij mij dat hij nooit van zijn leven in irak zou willen wonen daar hij de dictatuur van saddam hoessein te verwerpelijk vindt zoiets zegt hij nooit in het openbaar
4821225 while he was playing the piano and writing books about the negative influence of imperialism in the mean time we were fighting against a regime which calls itself anti imperialistic we risked our lives at the moment that he denied the crimes of the baath when we were in prison said told the world that saddam was not the criminal but mainly the west

4821237 el a o de trabajo dedicado al dise o preliminar demostr que de hecho la navegaci n llevada a cabo utilizando una vela solar era una t cnica viable para la propulsi n de naves espaciales
4821238 algunos afirman que znamya 2 era una vela porque estaba hecha de un gran reflector liviano y se despleg de la misma manera que se podr a desplegar una vela solar
4821239 de hecho si me pidieran demostrar la tecnolog a de las velas solares y tuviera la restricci n de desplegar una vela solar desde una gran nave espacial dise ar a una vela como znamya
4821240 cosmos 1 fue una nave espacial impulsada por una vela solar desarrollada en su totalidad cuyo objetivo era volar nicamente bajo la influencia de la presi n solar con el fin de controlar la rbita de la nave
4821241 si todo hubiera salido como se plane la sociedad planetaria de estados unidos trabajando conjuntamente con rusia podr a haber sido la primera en hacer volar en el espacio una vela solar completamente funcional aunque limitada desde el punto de vista de su rendimiento
4821242 esta podr a haber sido la primera vela solar estabilizada por rotaci n en vuelo libre en el espacio
4821243 el dise o de estas velas es lo suficientemente robusto como para poder desplegarlas en una atm sfera o en un ambiente con gravedad y se lo puede aplicar a escalas para producir velas solares de tama o mucho mayor quiz s hasta 150 metros de cada lado
4821244 para el a o 2010 es posible que la nasa lleve a cabo un vuelo de prueba
4821245 nuestro principal objetivo es demostrar el exitoso despliegue de una vela solar de muy escaso peso en una rbita baja alrededor de la tierra
4821246 si y esta es una condici n de vital importancia ellos pueden medir la presi n solar habr n demostrado que la presi n solar es un medio fundamental de maniobra orbital
4821247 la rbita que tenemos disponible en esta oportunidad de lanzamiento es muy baja quiz s no podamos permanecer en rbita el tiempo suficiente como para que los efectos de la presi n solar se acumulen en un grado que se pueda medir vamos a tener que observar muy de cerca los datos del vuelo para ver si podemos realizar esta determinaci n

4821412 mentally we didnt see very many busts a few from younger players but overall it was a very well played very clean scrimmage we saw a lot of good things on both sides of the ball when you have both first teams out there you want to have an equal number of positives and they both had their fair share today
4821413 a lot of times that part is difficult the first time you get into a game like situation and you install the kicking game but today that went very smooth
4821414 the defense penetrated well and it was good to see the offense respond cleanly
4821415 we normally havent gone through a practice without one or two picks and thats a credit to a very good veteran secondary today we had a few balls broken up by some good defensive plays and good breaks on the ball in the big picture today was a success all around
4821416 our pressure at times was very good especially in passing situations we did a good job of keeping the ball in front of us and i liked what i saw out of the number twos at times

4821465 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4821466 in the bible the last reference to her earthly life is found at the beginning of the acts of the apostles which presents mary gathered in prayer together with the disciples in the upper room waiting for the holy spirit
4821467 the most holy virgin mary must always be situated in the mystery of christ and of the church in this perspective just as the mother of jesus glorified in body and soul in heaven is the image and beginning of the church as it is to be perfected is the world to come so too does she shine forth on earth until the day of the lord shall come cf 2 pt 3 10 as a sign of sure hope and solace to the people of god during its sojourn on earth const lumen gentium 68 from paradise the virgin mary especially in their difficult times of trial continues always to watch over the children that jesus himself entrusted to her before dying on the cross
4821468 points out to us the ultimate destination of our earthly pilgrimage she reminds us that our entire being spirit soul and body is destined for the fullness of life that those who live and die in the love of god and of neighbor will be transfigured in the image of the glorious body of the risen christ that the lord humbles the proud and raises up the lowly cf lk 1 51 52 this is what the virgin mary proclaims eternally with the mystery of her assumption may you be always praised o virgin mary pray to the lord for us

4821476 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4821477 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4821478 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps

4821485 itll be a lot different now for the both of us
4821486 im with the skins now and hes with the jets not that we played a lot against each other before but it will be different to see him out there with all the hoopla and the media stuff going on around the game at the end of the day its still football and hes got to throw before i get there

4821506 were living on a planet thats going to hell in a handbag
4821507 at the mall you enter a condition of perfect climate control where its clean and orderly and you are not forced in any way to confront reality

4821576 your husband is right before you enter on the path of meditation you have to consider it because there are dangers ahead
4821577 you were right the more silent i became the more my husband became furious at me he was never so violent something strange started happening
4821578 the more silent and quiet i was becoming the more aggressive he was becoming

4821580 a magical moment something incredible in my career especially as we were both a bit down after losing in singles its incredible that we managed to stay on track to win in doubles
4821581 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it i dont have any comment to make on it
4821582 we actually opted for giovani dos santos because we thought that his speed would be something that would trouble middlesbrough
4821583 comes to my rescue its this really cool website that lets you pay in usd and ship the item right at the doorstep you can even get it
4821584 it was our first game and i think we did a good job
4821585 it was important to win the game we were a bit nervous especially they played well with the long ball and it was not easy for us
4821586 it was not easy for us but it was very good because we wanted to win our first game and start well
4821587 i think we have a lot of hard work ahead of us because it is just the beginning of the season
4821588 we didnt get off to a great start with them scoring early in the game but they are a great side
4821589 but once we got a grip of the game we gave a decent account of ourselves although they had about 20 opportunities and we probably only created one or two ourselves
4821590 we had a few problems down the right side and they capitalised on that but once we sorted out the problems we performed a lot better
4821591 youre just having a good time today arent you so keep dancing i bet you like me like those old records from the late 70s and early 80s
4821592 its a quick way to catch up on how a story has developed over time

4821594 we have a modern and impressive embassy and now we have a web site to match we hope all our customers will find it clear and accessible

4821637 the great masses of the people in the very bottom of their hearts tend to be corrupted rather than consciously and purposely evil and that therefore in view of the primitive simplicity of their minds they more easily fall a victim to a big lie than to a little one since they themselves lie in little things but would be ashamed of lies that were too big such a falsehood will never enter their heads and they will not be able to believe in the possibility of such monstrous effrontery and infamous misrepresentation in others yes even when enlightened on the subject they will long doubt and waver and continue to accept at least one of these causes as true therefore something of even the most insolent lie will always remain and stick a fact which all the great lie virtuosi and lying clubs in this world know only too well and also make the most treacherous use of

4821667 are you sure youre ok with this weve never pushed the envelope this far before lyrically there could be repercussions and they may not be great

4821679 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4821680 i told you all i was going to be no 1
4821681 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4821682 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know
4821683 i aim just to win but when i saw the replay i was amazed
4821684 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4821685 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4821686 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4821687 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4821688 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4821689 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4821690 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4821691 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4821692 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4821693 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do

4821707 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4821708 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4821709 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4821718 im really happy with him lancet all week i had been focusing on my grand prix preparation for the team
4821719 i had a really positive feeling throughout the test and he just got better and better im really proud of the way he coped with the atmosphere and conditions and i have proved to myself i can do it when it really matters

4821721 to my friend the governor who has been i believe a good servant of this province i have an inuit carving

4821723 hes helped us to advance a number of important development efforts as well as the security file so i can say from our own personal experience that its been very very positive working with governor khalid
4821724 at the request of the afghan president we have a new governor here he is well known to you guys hes worked here even before me he was here in this province
4821725 i am optimistic you will help this governor as you have helped me
4821726 my door will be open for you people all the time
4821727 from our perspective hes sent the signals that we would hope to see from someone entering office

4821755 were feeding them were looking after them theyre all civilians their own leadership abandoned them now we want to exchange them
4821756 there are more than 40 of them they are being held so that nothing happens to them we are ready to give them to the georgian side in exchange for our men
4821757 theyre prisoners of war theyre being held according to international standards no violence is being used against them they are being fed and are being allowed to call home
4821758 the more time passes the less chance they can be identified we dont have any refrigerators at the morgue
4821759 i think the georgian side is trying to hide the extent of its casualties in south ossetia
4821760 i plan the articles ill write the following week each sunday i write the topics the titles and the outlines for all the articles during the week i draft the articles further and then i write them drafting for me involves a combination of free writing and mind maps i separate the draft for a project from the writing by at least one day often by a week
4821761 many magazine writers have made the switch from magazines to writing web sites often for themselves
4821762 i look on my sites as magazines i add articles advertising editorial comments i love writing my own sites because i have complete control and its never dull i write what i please the only demand on myself i make is to write my five pages every day its a great gig

4821765 i wasnt really worried about the world record i didnt even know i got the world record until i did my victory lap i dont really know how fast i can go i even could be 9 60 i cant really say people have been saying i could run 9 60 but i havent seen the replay so i cant comment
4821766 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4821767 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4821768 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
4821769 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4821770 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4821771 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4821772 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
4821773 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful
4821774 the spirit of the football club was there for everybody to see
4821775 the fitness levels in the second half were incredible as was the passion and the drive the character was tremendous
4821776 before the game we said to the players that fulham didnt travel too well last season and we tried to exploit their weaknesses
4821777 we stuck to a game plan and the substitutions changed the game late on
4821778 im really pleased i was delighted with the goals we scored and the way we went about our work
4821779 theres a tendency to write off teams that come up from the championship but we dealt well with their long throws
4821780 we scored at the right times johan elmander was terrific fabrice muamba was superb but the whole team did really well
4821781 harbaugh talks about when they were building this wall one brick at a time
4821782 you see what hes trying to get at even though youre tired youve got to have the strength to pull that next man up so he can put that next brick up
4821783 it basically says if you want to be first you need to be last
4821784 the only way we can be a success is that everybody has to be held accountable and depend on each other
4821785 harbaugh is saying if were going to be a great team the defense has to make the offense better but the offense has to make the defense better
4821786 we used to make sure we handled ours and didnt concentrate on making them better we tried to make sure
4821787 its not just smacking the offense around in practice its about educating those guys about how and why were beating them and helping each other out at the end of the day we need them as much as they need us
4821788 every practice every game every play where the guys stand on the sideline how they lift weights the whole thing ive got a vision for every aspect of the program and what i want it to look like
4821789 not to say coach billick didnt have restrictions but everybody pretty much got treated like men
4821790 with young guys you have to draw that line a little bit just to give them some structure
4821791 in the first half i thought we were different class and played some lovely football we should have probably been two or three goals up
4821792 we got caught with a sucker punch just before half time and that kind of knocked us back as you could see with the performance in the first fifteen minutes of the second half it took us a while to get going again
4821793 but when we conceded the second goal the willingness and application to get back into the game the fighting spirit not just to get to 2 2 but to actually go on and win the game was absolutely incredible
4821794 last year at milton keynes we did exactly the same we did it at stockport last year we went 1 0 down 1 1 2 1 2 2 and it shows the sign of a team that has great spirit and great ability
4821795 well honey are you just here for cleaning or might you be having a few problems with your teeth
4821796 no really i had no dental insurance in college and law school i was too poor and then i just got to ashamed of myself to come when i finally became insured and unpoor
4821797 if it doesnt get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
4821798 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
4821799 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4821800 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4821801 it was something for us personally to say where do we measure up with the champions
4821802 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup
4821803 they wanted to make a statement in this game playing against us and they did
4821804 they sent a message to everybody in the tournament they didnt do it before and now everybody knows that theyre for real and theyre very serious about this
4821805 nationals of countries that are determined to be consistently refusing or unreasonably delaying repatriation
4821806 what are the benefits of your breaking that window many you calm yourself down the enclosure gets lighter and cooler the poisons rise a little off the floor the intensity lessens and the people you are looking for have a little more time for you to find them
4821807 at some point in the early 1990s they decided that what they really wanted was an iso 1
4821808 i think that they looked at the iso books and i know they talked to the iso person for that area i think the mission of the department was to score as many points as they could on the iso rating schedule
4821809 the time saving cure for information overload filtrbox is the media monitoring service of choice for savvy professionals filtrbox eliminates the need for multiple monitoring tools saving both time and money while increasing productivity and knowledge
4821810 whose innocent life had sprung by the inscrutable decree of providence
4821811 a lovely and immortal flower out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion
4821812 you say you love me and yet youll do this to me rob me of you forever
4821813 i planted in you this longing for peace only so that one day i could satisfy your longing and watch your happiness and now you push me away you put me out of reach
4821814 those who know me know that there is no money in the world that you could pay me for me to go up to a table where there are two beautiful women and invite them to come with me to oviedo
4821815 thats why you want to be an actor you want to live lives that you know would be impossible
4821816 its like id never kill anyone like my character in no country for old men but my killer side of me is already satisfied
4821817 the thought of him coming to spain and making a movie here i thought could be a great experience like it was
4821818 i loved the script and there wasnt much to talk about it was like ok where do i have to go
4821819 its funny when you go and work outside of your country when you come back even if i live here some people might think that i live in the states some people might think that i am impossible to reach some think that i might be a millionaire that earns a lot of money in movies so they cant afford me
4821820 so they have a lot of reasons and some of them may find me a really horrible actor and some of them may find me very old there are many reasons for people not to call me
4821821 but that doesnt mean that i dont want to do it actually it is what i want to do
4821822 this is a dream moment even if there is so much pressure
4821823 this bronze shines like a gold i have played pretty good tennis all the tournament
4821824 i had to play three matches in less than 24 hours
4821825 i was angry about that but i focussed it all on the court
4821826 but it didnt matter she said after beating the chinese player
4821827 i had to play three matches in less than 24 hours
4821828 i was angry a bout that but i focused it all on the court
4821829 ronnie drew was an iconic figure in irish music over the last five decades i met him and admired his music his unique singing voice was loved by so many people
4821830 ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
4821831 i was not worried about the world record i came here to be olympic champion this means a lot to my country and me i made history for myself and jamaica
4821832 i saw him him slowing down while i was still pumping to the finish line
4821833 we always rise to the occasion this win puts us on top of the world
4821834 he is still very young he has a long way to go it is only a matter of time until he runs faster
4821835 if you want to be the best you have to beat the best
4821836 i couldnt talk to him i was 200m down the track
4821837 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
4821838 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
4821839 this means a lot to my country and me i made history for myself and jamaica
4821840 i was not worried about the world record i came her to win
4821841 he was already slowing down while i was still pumping to the finish line
4821842 it was not my day i am really disappointed with myself
4821843 i am pretty upset i focused on the olympics so i am disappointed i just didnt have nothing in me today i ran as fast as i could i gave it 100 per cent
4821844 the injury was a setback to my training but no excuse because my hamstring feels fine
4821845 i never have breakfast i just got up at 11 watched some tv and had some nuggets i went back to my room and slept for three more hours then i had some nuggets and went out to the track
4821846 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4821847 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4821848 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4821849 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4821850 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4821851 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4821852 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4821853 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4821854 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4821855 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4821856 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers
4821857 im not about fighting it im not angry at all
4821858 people will be bringing this up for years saying you won that race
4821859 if we got to do this again i would win it
4821860 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
4821861 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it
4821862 people rarely died the first one i knew i was 18
4821863 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever
4821864 i got a tip for you tow guy kiss my ass
4821865 since the creation of mankind until the advent of doomsday no fitnah damage will be greater than that of the dajjals anti christ
4821866 we did not wish to provoke anyone and we apologize
4821867 i was kind of disappointed in the first three races and am glad to finally pull the win out here at my home track
4821868 i couldnt have done it without the support of volkswagen bosch and new england constables
4821869 its a great honor for us to have the jetta tdi cup come to lime rock i dont think lime rocks ever seen anything like it with the tents and organization on this scale
4821870 its great to see 30 young kids and the process of discovery they have to go through to be competitive here its very much in the spirit of lime rock which is a track where a lot of people have learned how to drive the drivers are all eager very capable and have great cars at their disposal i think its fantastic

4821878 w hat do you want to bet that a lot of those wealthy liberals have funny last names
4821879 contractors are much hungrier for the business now much more responsive and more willing to negotiate on scheduling and things like that
4821880 im guessing there will be some negotiating on pricing too but their labor costs have probably not gone down and their material costs have by and large gone up
4821881 the slump in housing markets has not yet run its full course
4821882 mortgage rates have barely responded to the aggressive easing of the federal reserve the supply of for sale vacant units continues to grow and much tighter underwriting is locking many would be homebuyers out of the market with home prices falling in most metropolitan areas homeowners are tightening their belts remodeling less and staying on the sidelines
4821883 the thing is i cant just hug a stranger when i win singles
4821884 in singles youre all alone on the court you win you sit down this is quite a surreal moment its a joy sharing this victory with somebody else who i like very much who we had a great two weeks with its quite different to anything ive ever gone through
4821885 i told myself let me try for a big second serve because i know i have it in my game otherwise ill have stanley at the net finishing it off himself
4821886 i love great players he has not handed in a transfer request and manchester united have not made an offer so i cant really comment i have no news for the moment he is a spurs player we are happy with him and there is nothing really to say on it
4821887 we have had wobbly moments with players leaving in the summer but i know the capabilities of this team i am delighted we worked all through the summer on our philosophies and winning like that keeps everyones optimism going it was a terrific start
4821888 ive been told not to use the injuries as an excuse so im not going to mention them
4821889 in the second half we slaughtered them in their own backyard
4821890 that good installer is turning out to be an illusive creature
4821891 if this person cant even keep his vehicle in order what kind of order will my installation be kept in
4821892 i understand that scepticism comes with the territory because past champions tested positive for drugs the olympic champion has to be clean and then has to prove it
4821893 if people say its suspicious come down and see our programme come down and see our testing day and night we have nothing to hide
4821894 palm centro has the power of a broadband smartphone at the price of a standard 12 key phone
4821895 theyve been doing it for about two or three years now
4821896 you gotta expect the move call is going to happen and that the defense is going to try and bait you to jump offsides the ref isnt going to be able to hear that when you have 110 000 people so you have to be disciplined
4821897 i dont know if we are that good on defense or we still didnt get that much better on offense
4821898 it was some good and some bad were not handling punts well
4821899 the act of consumption was itself an act of creation no additional effort expended
4821900 you look at the two goalkeepers and vauxhalls was certainly the busiest
4821901 were a bit disappointed with the result but were glad to have got something out of the game
4821902 we had a few chances there late on from one of which their goalkeeper has pulled off a really good save
4821903 im a bit disappointed as we could have maybe pinched all three points but overall im pleased the point away from home
4821904 look at me my face is next to a plant im so pretty
4821905 a spectator wearing a non authorised logo will not have any trouble to get in as long as its not part of a large scale organised ambush action we are acting with common sense and are by no means aggressive
4821906 this is a historic day in the struggle for animal rights and in defense of our evolutionary comrades which will doubtless go down in the history of humanity
4821907 we have no knowledge of great apes being used in experiments in spain but there is currently no law preventing that from happening

4821916 yes i imagine many people not just speakers of foreign languages will wonder about that then theyll realize this is a news and politics site then in a flash theyll realize it means were at least 24 hours ahead of other sites in reporting on things and due to that flash this site will be seared in their memory forever it is psychology mon ami also everyone thinks about time zones when traveling or contacting persons in other states and they know that for instance the east coast is three hours ahead every time they think of such things the neurons in their brains will associate those thoughts with this site and they will come back to check on whats new

4821926 dandy walker syndrome said darla rae the films executive producer and director rae was on hand for the screening in houston and is still amazed at how people receive the cinema verte style documentary which she made to help raise awareness its always interesting when people see it and are overcome with emotions then you know your touching hearts one can only hope that you touch them enough so that they tell others we want everyone to know about this problem these parents receive this diagnosis and they are made to think its a death sentence mainly since the medical community is at a loss for words
4821927 i receive numerous calls and emails weekly if not daily asking for help in understanding this diagnosis

4821933 see in my line of work you got to keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda
4821934 america was never innocent we popped our cherry on the boat over and looked back with no regrets you cant ascribe our fall from grace to any single event or set of circumstances you cant lose what you lacked at conception
4821935 mass market nostalgia gets you hopped up for a past that never existed hagiography sanctifies shuck and jive politicians and reinvents their expedient gestures as moments of great moral weight our continuing narrative line is blurred past truth and hindsight only a reckless verisimilitude can set that line straight

4821940 sentences of yours running throughout my head dont remember this part day or night dark or light youll be taking over that thing called my shadow
4821941 when i turn 94 i think ill miss you even more
4821942 well my mother in law hid in the bathroom the entire time
4821943 comenc a sentir dolor en los ltimos 10 metros esta era mi ltima competencia individual y quer a terminar tan fuerte como pudiera
4821944 that was one of the things zack snyder the director said to me from the start i really want this to be incredibly brutal its not a turn on kind of story its bad its important that we did that i think hopefully it will be really powerful
4821945 lots of luck people at least my wish is something i might get
4821946 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4821947 technically we didnt do a lot wrong i just think we made simple mistakes
4821948 the all blacks tactical kicking in the second half was very good and they forced us to make simple mistakes
4821949 were obviously very disappointed were all very happy for percy the guys were really excited for percy and it took us 20 minuted to get into the game
4821950 it started off badly for us and it just went worse everyone tried so hard to rectify each others mistakes that they made their own mistakes
4821951 you get those days when you make simple mistakes if you look at how many balls went to the deck thats not characteristic of the team and the players
4821952 i know my guys and i know their abilities we dont slip on the same banana peel twice we can make one promise to our fans well be back
4821953 theyre professionals they know they are capable of better and i know it too they will pick themselves up we just need to believe in ourselves if you were in the dressingroom now you could see the disappointment on each and every one of their faces its not because they lost a game but because they know they can do better
4821954 one enormous positive was at scrum time which is where we normally struggle against the new zealand even if they come with some new tactics to hit us they didnt get it right
4821955 they played the referee if it was legal or illegal i dont know but they played the referee better than we did
4821956 i think its very difficult when youre in the heat of the moment
4821957 were going to have to go back and have a look at the video i felt the tackler kept on lying there on the ball the referee didnt really give me any answers he was more worried about our guys coming in from the side
4821958 they the players are in a transition period at the moment ive got a style of rugby that i want to implement and it will take time
4821959 if you look at a super 14 team it will take you more than a year and a half to get exactly what you want and weve made great progress
4821960 what we did in the past as south african rugby players when there was nothing on is to go to ground i want to do things the other way around so theyre used to the old style of play and when it gets tough they go back to what they know i but wont give up on that
4821961 were not far from what i want maybe the fear factor is still there were not afraid of anyone on the field maybe were afraid of ourselves afraid to make mistakes
4821962 we created so many opportunities i felt we played better than the score reflected but thats international rugby its one or two decisions that you make that makes you win or lose its a pity we made the wrong decisions at the wrong time
4821963 ive had the support of the coach and the team and the fans its been a long career for me and its all come together but unfortunately we didnt get the result we wanted today due to basic errors but you know what the best thing about rugby is weve got next week

4821968 the difference between them and anybody who is in jail is that in jail the government pays for them but if theyre on the streets we pay for them what kind of a government makes prisoners of 43 mothers who all have children and then says you cant work you cant leave and cant stay that boggles the imagination

4821970 would it really be such a tragedy if someone killed them for their blasphemy against god that is being used to cut deep into the hearts of those poor grieving families
4821971 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven 4therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
4821972 we really limited our defense not knowing who is in the stands and we limited our offense some in the passing game
4821973 the offense certainly did what they were supposed to do
4821974 when you limit the defensive scheme then they should respond offensively the good part is they did our defense responded and did some good things in spite of not using but a fourth of what their defensive package is
4821975 the right of decision belongs to the majority but the right of representation belongs to all
4821976 i dont know if were that good on defense or if our offense is in need of improvement
4821977 on the bright side our timing and execution improved on offense as the scrimmage went on and we did cut back some on the penalties

4822039 the actual physical infrastructure of these places is where our assessment teams are saying is not in good shape sanitation issues water supply electricity it is a big issue so making sure that all of these 170 centers are equipped well i think will be one of the concerns that we are doing there
4822040 we are also moving towards a new school year in the area and unicef would like to set a goal to try to get every displaced child back into school by the new school year
4822041 it is creating that sense of normalcy that we really need to have it is an important haven not only for the children but also for parents i think getting that going but also getting the social support and interaction is also a major concern
4822042 i dont know whats in these or how you people make them but wow
4822043 well nobody seemed very excited about hearing about the customs of tet the vietnamese new year
4822044 but we ran out of banh bao dumplings almost immediately clearly there is a strong interest in the rich cultural heritage of vietnam

4822053 so your now a god and a new free online spellchecker
4822054 the official track brings it off the west coast of florida tuesday and wednesday however the track is always uncertain and the entire peninsula of florida needs to pay attention to the storm
4822055 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4822056 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4822057 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4822058 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4822059 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4822060 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4822061 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4822062 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4822063 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4822064 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4822065 itll be a lot different now for the both of us
4822066 im with the skins now and hes with the jets not that we played a lot against each other before but it will be different to see him out there with all the hoopla and the media stuff going on around the game at the end of the day its still football and hes got to throw before i get there
4822067 what about american support when it is about israel america gets involved what do you think about that
4822068 america gives support and will continue to do so america does all sorts of things that are not honest generally it does not get any results from what it does we advise them not to do this it is against the good of the american people they should not damage the personality and character of the great american people for a murderous regime our advice to them is not to support them israel for the good of everybody america europe and the middle east of course this way friendships will be built
4822069 elections in the u s are near do you think americas attitude will change with a new president do you prefer obama or mccain
4822070 for me it doesnt matter it is the americans right it is their elections i wish they had free elections in america then many different people would come forth and americans would have choices other than the two parties
4822071 what is important is what kind of attitude the new administration will demonstrate
4822072 i think that wise persons in america are well aware of this need for change
4822073 whatever government comes it must leave the middle east china asia or africa and look to its own states if it takes pity on the american people if it really wants to work for the american people wise people in america have already come to this conclusion it does not matter who will come but what he will do

4822132 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
4822133 for many americans mr mccains rhetoric sounded almost like a trip back in time to the days of the cold war when major foreign policy addresses by american presidential aspirants always included the requisite bashing of the soviet union

4822253 president medvedev of russia has now signed on to the terms of this agreement and thats an important development its a hopeful step
4822254 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4822255 president sarkozy told me that president medvedev had told him that the minute saakashvili signed that document russian forces would begin to withdraw
4822256 well i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk it is about russias standing in the international community
4822257 that is that you behave in a 1968 way toward your small neighbors by invading them and at the same time you continue to integrate into the political and diplomatic and economic and security structures of the international community

4822266 the number of months in the sight of allah is twelve in a year so ordained by him the day he created the heavens and the earth of them four are sacred that is the straight usage so wrong not yourselves therein and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together but know that allah is with those who restrain themselves
4822267 verily the transposing of a prohibited month is an addition to unbelief the unbelievers are led to wrong thereby for they make it lawful one year and forbidden another year in order to adjust the number of months forbidden by allah and make such forbidden ones lawful the evil of their course seems pleasing to them but allah guideth not those who reject faith

4822270 i never liked what he did because he only thought of himself in the match my foot was broken it was his fault bubba dudley is the most out of shape fat non work ethic having person i knew and you had a bad taste in your mouth when you met him
4822271 i thank god that i broke my collarbone at the time i wasnt thankful i missed work but being home with my wife the last two months of the pregnancy and witnessing the birth of my baby which could have missed if i was on the road that would have been horrible
4822272 but the flip side of all that is i was becoming very unhappy there we were hired because of who we were on the independents and that sure wasnt what we were allowed to be on t v the goofy guys you saw on there just wasnt who we were and with a gimmick like that i knew it was going to be hard to step out from that shadow and be taken seriously and we werent also after monday night i knew the writing was on the wall i hadnt been in a ring for seven months and the match we did seemed like a swansong to us both

4822278 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4822279 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4822280 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4822281 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4822282 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4822283 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4822284 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4822285 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4822286 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4822287 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4822288 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4822289 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4822290 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4822291 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

4822298 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4822299 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4822301 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4822302 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4822303 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4822304 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4822305 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4822306 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4822307 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4822308 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4822309 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4822310 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4822311 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4822312 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4822313 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4822314 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4822315 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4822316 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4822317 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4822318 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4822319 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4822320 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4822321 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4822322 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4822323 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4822324 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4822325 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4822326 the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has the russian federation as its aim
4822327 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4822328 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4822329 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4822330 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4822331 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4822332 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4822333 they the diocesan authorities and the trustees of the diocese of leeds will have to decide what happens to it then whether it gets sold and so on
4822334 i am conscious of those among you who have invested so much of your lives and energy into these parishes which will no longer exist i am aware of your pain and your sense of bereavement at this time i believe these changes however to be necessary in order to put the church on a better footing to meet the missionary needs both of the present day and of the years to come
4822335 as you are aware the style of liturgy here at st johns is a little different from many of the surrounding parishes indeed radically different from st benedicts next door
4822336 we realise that there are those who think that the style of liturgy here has been imposed on us by fr mark this is patently untrue as a community we are wholeheartedly behind fr mark in his mission to serve christ his church and his people the parishioners comments appended to this proposal are genuine and heartfelt
4822337 he the bishop then opened a major period of consultation with all the parishioners in the pontefract and wakefield deaneries in september last year which ran until the end of november
4822338 he worked hard through the distribution of dvds the use of the website and the catholic post to put forward his reasons for adjusting the structures of his diocese and invited suggestions to ameliorate his proposals no such suggestions were brought forward this was announced in his pastoral letter of trinity sunday which described the changes he needs to make
4822339 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4822340 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4822341 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4822342 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4822343 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4822344 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4822345 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4822346 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4822347 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4822348 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4822349 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4822350 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4822351 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4822352 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4822353 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4822354 who are open to doing something on the production side
4822355 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4822356 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4822357 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4822358 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4822359 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4822360 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4822361 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4822362 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4822363 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4822364 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4822365 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4822366 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4822367 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4822368 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4822369 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4822370 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4822371 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4822372 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4822373 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4822374 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4822375 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4822376 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4822377 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4822378 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4822379 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4822380 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4822381 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4822382 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

4822406 primero que todo colombia debe dejar en claro si lo que los paramilitares cometieron en colombia fueron cr menes de lesa humanidad o cr menes de guerra pero esto es dif cil si se mantiene la tesis colombiana de que no hay un conflicto armado

4822415 i thought our defense played pretty solid football but offensively we obviously had too many drops
4822416 you cant drop that many footballs in the game and expect to move the ball consistently we have to cut down on the penalties its good that theyre happening now so that we can get them corrected and worked on so that they dont happen during the season
4822417 it looked like he got a bit tired he banged up his leg and fell on his knee but he bounced back which was a good thing he was a little sore but he pulled himself back and worked his way through it and it worked out for him i thought he caught the ball ok he had a couple drops in there that we need to make sure we take care of

4822420 coach marty mornhinweg has a lot of things in the offense for me im just trying to do my best and get open as much as possible
4822421 kick returns punt returns interceptions theres just a certain feeling you get when you have the ball in your hands if im on the field long enough something is going to happen for me thats a proven fact
4822422 i should have got the sack but he threw it before i could get there
4822423 i put my hands up learning from brian dawkins he always puts his hands up i just put mine up and tipped the ball
4822424 i thought he played well particularly in that fourth quarter in a lot of different areas both special teams and on the offense
4822425 when i got here it was you better be able to contribute on special teams
4822426 i had never played special teams in 4 years of college but i knew this preseason i would have an opportunity to show the coaches i can contribute on special teams and i can contribute running the football i know the assignments i know how to pick up the blitz
4822427 it was awesome when i handed to him and turned around the hole was as big a truck and he just did the rest but an even better play was when i threw him a low pass and he caught it with one hand and picked up a first down and we scored a few plays later that got us on a roll
4822428 with five running backs in training camp it is hard to get reps but you just have to be patient i knew i would get the reps in preseason games and when i got that chance i just wanted to do as much as i could
4822429 da igual que el gato sea blanco o negro lo importante es que cace ratones
4822430 if it doesnt i think well be ok since they have played together in years past if i had my choice id much rather have them do that

4822434 one of the great minds and probably the most influential theologians of the early christian era
4822435 paul perceived that there are impressive doctrines which are convincing to most people but which present as truth what is untrue seeing that there was some greatness apparent in the theories of the wisdom of the philosophers were according to the elements of the cosmos but no intelligent person would say that this was the case for celsus
4822436 how could the christian interpreter respond adequately to the gnostic charge that many old testament texts presented a deity who was jealous vengeful apt to change and in many instances responsible for evil itself
4822437 is continually waving his theological antennae over the literal sense of the biblical text and if a text fails to satisfy or make sense to him on a literal reading origen will employ the larger symbolic field he has culled from scripture as a whole to discern a deeper allegorical sense
4822438 now there are many who are sincerely concerned about religion and who fall here into great perplexity they are afraid that they may be proclaiming two gods and their fear drives them into doctrines which are false and wicked either they deny that the son has a distinct nature of his own besides that of the father and make him whom they call the son to be god all but the name or they deny the divinity of the son giving him a separate existence of his own and making his sphere of essence fall outside that of the father so that they are separable from each other
4822439 proceeds from the son and is related to him as the son is related to the father
4822440 the god and father who holds the universe together is superior to every being that exists for he imparts to each one from his own existence that which each one is the son being less than the father is superior to rational creatures alone for he is second to the father the holy spirit is still less and dwells within the saints alone so that in this way the power of the father is greater than that of the son and of the holy spirit and that of the son is more than that of the holy spirit and in turn the power of the holy spirit exceeds that of every other holy being
4822441 we consider therefore that there are three hypostases the father and the son and the holy spirit and at the same thee we believe nothing to be uncreated but the father we therefore as the more pious and the truer course admit that all things were made by the logos and that the holy spirit is the most excellent and the first in order of all that was made by the father through christ
4822442 i oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution and similar efforts to amend the u s constitution or those of other states
4822443 for too long issues of lgbt rights have been exploited by those seeking to divide us its time to move beyond polarization and live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect this is no less than a core issue about who we are as democrats and as americans
4822444 committed to ending the pandemic and human suffering caused by hiv the san francisco aids foundation develops innovative solutions combining scientific evidence with community experience to fight hiv aids and promote health established in 1982 the foundation provides direct services to thousands of people living with or at risk for hiv aids and supplies information to thousands more about hiv prevention and treatment through programs that include the california aids hotline 800 367 aids the foundation promotes hiv awareness in the community and advocates for sound hiv aids policies at all levels of government
4822445 waving your hands at an aids lifecycle staff is grounds for immediate expulsion from the ride
4822446 the qualifying result today is a bit disappointing i think we had the capability to have both riders a bit further up the grid we just missed the best of the conditions to improve further
4822447 also when our guys went out at the end on new development rain tyres the performance wasnt as good as the normal wets which have worked superbly all day but of course we have to try all the options
4822448 im in fourth place on the grid and really happy with that and it gives me a good opportunity in whatever conditions tomorrow to get away at the front i hope it is fine and we can have a strong race and fight for another podium

4822450 to all those involved sinners in spirit and whoever helps and protects them may they feel a curse on their souls may it plague them and may evil pursue them they will not be acquitted of their transgressions from heavenly judgment
4822451 know what happened to the evil persons who were cursed and thus feel in your souls that your end will be bitter
4822452 the badatz acceded judgment to the heavens they will be dealt with there
4822453 is the discovery that this is not what the founding fathers of our country intended when they established our nation and wrote the constitution and bill of rights they in fact had a radically different definition of establishment and the role of religion in state and federal governments than we do today so radical in fact that some say the modern understanding of the role of religion in the public square is exactly the opposite of what the founders intended

4822460 the hazards americans treat as facts of life the risk of losing your insurance the risk that you wont be able to afford necessary care the chance that youll be financially ruined by medical costs would be considered unthinkable in any other advanced nation
4822461 the national institute for health and clinical guidelines nice has ruled for the first time that saving a life cannot be justified at any cost
4822462 nice is facing growing criticism over the number of drugs it is now rejecting which are available throughout europe and in america last week it refused to sanction four kidney cancer drugs which can double life expectancy

4822487 councils would step in to deal with an under nourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different
4822488 there needs to be a national debate about the extent to which it is acceptable for local authorities to take action in cases where the welfare of children is in real jeopardy
4822489 it falls to social services to care for the house bound obese adults to invest money in encouraging people to be active and to replace school furniture that is just too small for larger pupils

4822590 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4822591 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

4822593 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4822594 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4822595 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4822596 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4822597 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4822598 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4822599 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4822601 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4822602 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

4822610 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4822611 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4822612 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4822613 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4822614 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4822615 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4822616 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

4822631 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4822632 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4822633 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4822634 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4822635 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4822636 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo

4822640 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4822641 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4822642 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4822643 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4822644 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4822645 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4822646 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4822647 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4822648 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4822649 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4822650 sister a real terrible thing has happened to our town
4822651 weve got a lot of people here who need help we cant just throw them out on the street
4822652 theyre our family theyve made their homes here had jobs here raised families here
4822653 this town has constantly been changing it had opened its heart to change but now i sense anguish within people
4822654 they are asking whats going to happen to the town
4822655 a lot of good workers were taken away a lot of good families are gone
4822656 the community is drained of our giving energy of wondering how long the new people will stay if it will be a culture that fits into our community we are grieving scared apprehensive
4822657 i am very nervous i dont know what is going to happen and i dont know if i have the strength to keep fighting
4822658 i wish i could plead with the judge for my childrens sake that he would give me a little more time here so my children could continue studying so i could keep working
4822659 you come here with so many plans and illusions that your children will do better than you did
4822660 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4822661 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4822662 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4822663 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4822664 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4822665 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4822666 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4822667 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4822668 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4822669 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4822670 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4822671 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
4822672 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us

4822797 saakasjvili weigerde allerlei onderdelen van het verdrag te accepteren maar rice heeft hem zover gekregen het te ondertekenen
4822798 ik heb de westerse leiders gewaarschuwd voor wat er zou gebeuren als ze ons niet zouden toelaten maar ze wilden niet luisteren

4822801 the brief to design a future classic black trouser has to be one of the most challenging for a mens wear designer
4822802 each of the hand picked designers contributing to the black trousers project have managed to design a pair that not only reflects their own design aesthetic but challenges the existing topman one all immediately desirable wearable and ultimately collectable
4822803 they gave us the very best position in the store moving other brands for us we could not say no and the business has been phenomenal for tom ford since the january opening

4822809 thank you for your awesome posts deceiver is by far the best new blog i discovered this year
4822810 thank you for having the balls to cut through the spin and hype
4822811 oh my god can i come and work for you people
4822812 it is nice to get intellectual about something that really has no bearing on anyones life
4822813 another blog filled with the angry ramblings of the jealous and envious
4822814 interesting that most of the hypocrisy comes from popular and attractive women
4822815 love your site btw im so through with all that nasty perez like gossip based on nothing
4822816 how did i ever live without the keen insights and cutting observations of deceiver
4822817 this act disgusted and shocked citizens all over the commonwealth
4822818 these violent killings were totally unnecessary particularly considering that there are rescue societies that would have taken all of the dogs regardless of their ages or conditions
4822819 clearly the time has come to enact legislation that would make this practice illegal and raise the standards under which the states commercial breeding kennel industry operates there is simply no excuse for continued inaction
4822820 it is narrow minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings to playing on the piano and embroidering bags
4822821 lets stop at the gas station in town and get a pack of beers before we head back to memphis

4822823 no im not talking about the weather the sale of alcohol is against the law inside the whole county
4822824 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia

4822835 george lucass never ending sci fi saga gets an animation makeover which at least spares us the agony of watching perfectly decent actors sporting hideous costumes and spouting banalities to one another
4822836 the sheer brain frazzling pointlessness of it all predominates why why do this again at 64 lucas is surely not too old to have a crack at creating a movie that has nothing to do with star wars at all
4822837 the one superpower sandler will never master im afraid is the ability to be funny
4822838 lost interest in the story or ran out of ideas halfway through
4822839 this frantic film has a deeply unrelaxed and misjudged awfulness
4822840 as an escapist fairytale it works well channelling the quick fire morally ambiguous screwball comedies of the era
4822841 he is thoughtful high minded and courageous in espousing americas most unfashionable political cause

4822846 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4822847 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4822848 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4822849 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4822850 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4822851 the group now poses no real or alarming threat as it has been under control since the executions of its leaders
4822852 we have successfully combated them there has hardly been any bomb attack in the past two years and we have arrested a lot of its members
4822853 they have not been wiped out yet but they are very much under control
4822854 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
4822855 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4822856 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic
4822857 liberals are meaner cheaper more willing to steal than conservatives
4822858 hey mom mom hey mom what is he saying i cant understand him
4822859 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4822860 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4822861 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4822862 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4822863 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4822864 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4822865 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4822866 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4822867 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4822868 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4822869 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4822870 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4822871 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4822872 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4822873 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4822874 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4822875 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4822876 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4822877 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4822878 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4822879 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4822880 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4822881 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4822882 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4822883 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4822884 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4822885 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4822886 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4822887 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4822888 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4822889 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4822890 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4822891 i assume you to be an intelligent person and therefore i will provide you with tons of information so you can get a clear idea of whats going on and better appreciate this fiction
4822892 i assume you to be an intelligent person therefore its only right of me to push that intelligence further to not only grease those wheels but to then burn them out as well
4822893 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4822894 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4822895 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4822896 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4822897 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4822898 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4822899 if you talk to god you are praying if god talks to you you have schizophrenia
4822900 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4822901 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4822902 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4822903 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4822904 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4822905 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4822906 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4822907 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4822908 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4822909 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4822910 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4822911 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4822912 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4822913 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4822914 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4822915 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4822916 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4822917 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4822918 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4822919 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4822920 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4822921 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4822922 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4822923 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4822924 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4822925 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4822926 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4822927 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4822928 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4822929 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4822930 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4822931 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4822932 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4822933 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4822934 what do you want your look to say to people
4822935 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4822936 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4822937 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4822938 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4822939 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4822940 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4822941 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4822942 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4822943 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4822944 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4822945 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4822946 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4822947 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4822948 how did you manage to find a creature that has eluded modern technology and civilization for centuries
4822949 when was the last time you found a bear skeleton in the woods
4822950 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4822951 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4822952 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4822953 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4822954 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4822955 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4822956 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4822957 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4822958 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4822959 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4822960 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4822961 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4822962 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4822963 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4822964 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4822965 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4822966 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4822967 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4822968 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4822969 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4822970 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4822971 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4822972 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4822973 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4822974 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4822975 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4822976 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4822977 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4822978 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4822979 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4822980 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4822981 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4822982 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4822983 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4822984 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4822985 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4822986 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4822987 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4822988 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4822989 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4822990 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4822991 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4822992 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4822993 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4822994 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4822995 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4822996 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4822997 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4822998 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4822999 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4823000 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4823001 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4823002 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4823003 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4823004 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4823005 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4823006 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4823007 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4823008 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4823009 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4823010 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4823011 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4823012 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4823013 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4823014 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4823015 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4823016 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4823017 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4823018 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4823019 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4823020 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4823021 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4823022 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4823023 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4823024 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4823025 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4823026 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4823027 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4823028 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4823029 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4823030 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4823031 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4823032 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4823033 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4823034 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4823035 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4823036 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4823037 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4823038 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4823039 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4823040 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4823041 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4823042 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4823043 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4823044 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4823045 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4823046 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4823047 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4823048 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4823049 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4823050 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4823051 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4823052 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4823053 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4823054 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4823055 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4823056 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4823057 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4823058 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4823059 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4823060 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4823061 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4823062 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4823063 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4823064 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4823065 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4823066 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4823067 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4823068 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4823069 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4823070 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4823071 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4823072 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4823073 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4823074 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4823075 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4823076 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4823077 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4823078 i played it at a bar one time and kept getting better and finally im here
4823079 id be playing cornhole anyway so i can support a good cause doing so
4823080 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4823081 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4823082 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4823083 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4823084 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4823085 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4823086 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4823087 ja ja ja qu bueno igual te cargo por si sin querer se te gastan adem s quiero que siempre tengas cr dito para que puedas comunicarte cuando lo necesites besitos
4823088 hola c mo estas t s mejor el domingo a la tarde reservalo para juntarnos con 8 nombra dos menores m s con los nokia que trae gio ves el 7610 a ver si te gusta
4823089 with the ball we look like we can score but defensively to be polite we were poor
4823090 its exciting to see the framework begin for the actual building
4823091 it means were getting that much closer to being able to provide more sorely needed hospital beds for the community
4823092 construction is on schedule and this phase will continue for the next 90 days
4823093 if people are in need of medical care we wont tell them sorry were full we make it work
4823094 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4823095 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4823096 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4823097 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4823098 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4823099 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4823100 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4823101 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4823102 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4823103 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4823104 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4823105 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4823106 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4823107 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4823108 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4823109 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4823110 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4823111 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4823112 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4823113 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4823114 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4823115 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4823116 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4823117 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4823118 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4823119 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4823120 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4823121 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4823122 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4823123 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4823124 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4823125 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4823126 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4823127 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4823128 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4823129 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4823130 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4823131 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4823132 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4823133 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4823134 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4823135 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4823136 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4823137 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4823138 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4823139 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4823140 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4823141 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4823142 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4823143 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4823144 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4823145 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4823146 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4823147 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4823148 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4823149 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4823150 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4823151 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4823152 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4823153 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4823154 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4823155 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4823156 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4823157 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4823158 we will be closed saturday 8 16 08 we will resume our regular hours on saturday 8 23 08 and be open 11am 4pm
4823159 hi i am ready to go shopping lets get going before all the good stuff is gone
4823160 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4823161 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4823162 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4823163 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4823164 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4823165 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4823166 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4823167 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4823168 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4823169 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4823170 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4823171 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4823172 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4823173 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4823174 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4823175 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4823176 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4823177 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4823178 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4823179 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4823180 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4823181 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4823182 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4823183 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4823184 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4823185 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4823186 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4823187 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4823188 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4823189 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4823190 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4823191 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4823192 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4823193 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it

4823197 she had a brief conversation with him but he wasnt going to come out

4823211 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4823212 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4823213 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4823214 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4823215 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4823216 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4823217 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4823218 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4823219 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4823220 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4823221 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4823222 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4823223 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4823224 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4823225 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker

4823245 in recent years the great artesian basin has had its water resource plan wrp and resource operations plans rop finalised
4823246 the state government has also been an active participant in the great artesian basin sustainability initiative gabsi which is working to cap free flowing bores across the basin
4823247 since gabsi started in 1989 more than 540 bores have been capped and 9400 kilometres of open bore drains have been piped
4823248 today around 161 000 megalitres of water is being saved every year thanks to gabsi

4823271 het apparaat geeft voor de chauffeur enorm veel stress omdat hij continu de kans loopt op boetes als door een file of gebrek aan parkeerplaatsen de rijtijd wordt overschreden daarbij kan hij boetes krijgen die oplopen tot duizenden euros chauffeurs zitten continu te rekenen hoe ver ze nog kunnen rijden tot aan een veilige parkeerplaats wij vragen het kabinet om deze en de andere negen knelpunten met spoed aan te pakken dit is h t moment om door te pakken want zowel onze top 10 als het onlangs verschenen rapport weg belemmeringen laten zien dat het wegnemen van lasten in een paar maanden geregeld kan worden

4823298 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4823299 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4823300 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4823301 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4823302 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4823303 the channel simply used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
4823304 pravda ru journalists concluded that the footage of destruction fires and crying civilians used by sky news in its gori report was identical to the footage aired by russian tv channel zvezda star when it reported about tskhinvali
4823305 on wednesday sky news made a report about russian tanks supposedly advancing towards georgias gori the information was subsequently rebutted the company aired the footage which showed that the small town had been destroyed
4823306 georgian authorities and western media outlets previously said that the russian aviation had bombed gori which led to numerous casualties russia strongly rejected those statements
4823307 the footage aired by the british tv channel was preceded with a picture of a road sign displaying the name of the town gori written in georgian and english languages the report also said that a sky news correspondent was reporting from the georgian town
4823308 however the footage that followed the picture of the road sign was fake
4823309 russia s tv channel zvezda which has five camera crews working in tskhinvali aired the same footage two days before on monday sky news showed its report with no sound whereas the people showed in the russian report could be heard speaking russian and ossetian languages the crying people shown in the report were heard cursing georgian president saakashvili for destructions and manslaughter
4823310 the spirit of the football club was there for everybody to see
4823311 the fitness levels in the second half were incredible as was the passion and the drive the character was tremendous
4823312 before the game we said to the players that fulham didnt travel too well last season and we tried to exploit their weaknesses
4823313 we stuck to a game plan and the substitutions changed the game late on
4823314 im really happy because there werent many times last season we came from behind to win
4823315 could i have asked for more i would have liked a clean sheet as those are going to be very important this season
4823316 he gives us something that we perhaps didnt have last season a little bit of quality in the middle
4823317 he didnt really get a fair crack of the whip at manchester city last season and i couldnt believe it when he became available
4823318 at times in the first half we were on the back foot and their goal knocked the stuffing out of us
4823319 we were chasing shadows for 15 minutes after that and if they had got a second it probably would have been game over
4823320 i love yous instead they incorporated witty and meaningful one liners that can evoke emotion to a viewer of course this only works if you understand korean
4823321 so yeah somethings going on there youre gonna hit that
4823322 heres the reality everyone in every occupation starts as an apprentice those who are good enough become journeymen the best become master craftsmen
4823323 in an increasingly class riven america o ur obsession with the ba has created a two tiered entry to adulthood anointing some for admission to the club and labeling the rest as second best
4823324 oh i just saw the pop tarts and cereal and stuff i can always tell when someone has kids from their groceries
4823325 yeah a five year old our food standards dropped considerably when we had her
4823326 i was just thinking how nice it used to be when we could eat grown up food without watching someone small at the table gagging and complaining that it tastes funny
4823327 well ill tell you the food is pretty good but id trade you any day of the week
4823328 my wife and i just got back from 3 weeks in thailand and found your backpacks to both of good design and good quality and would gladly recommend them to anyone regards bob

4823330 calif june home price plunge 28 worst in u s
4823331 nominal home price declines have stabilized in the 10 to 11 percent range for several months
4823332 to speed up the disposition of the 54 000 foreclosed properties it owns fannie mae is opening offices in california and florida and is considering selling those properties in bulk to investors
4823333 i do not think this is a time to be holding onto foreclosed properties hoping for a better day
4823334 becuase if they are recorded individually at a huge discount and then rented out this will drive comps way down
4823335 from their site it looks like fannie has 1920 properties in ca not a whole heck of a lot in oc mainly condos in the nicer areas the couple in dp and ln were priced north of 300 sq ft so they are not giving them away
4823336 what happens if thousands of homes get recorded at 15 25 below existing comps
4823337 the number of properties that have been foreclosed on by the banks and still havent sold is the highest weve ever seen
4823338 likely delay the inevitable that most of those properties go into foreclosure
4823339 pat you sound like a puppy dog with his tail between his legs
4823340 so provider if thousands of houses that are now part of the new comps get recorded 15 25 below other comps the appraisers just ignore them
4823341 do not ask your agent if this is the right time for you to buy
4823342 so provider if thousands of houses that are now part of the new comps get recorded 15 25 below other comps the appraisers just ignore them
4823343 later on the owner realizes you duped him into taking a fake asset he did not trust and verify
4823344 the most probable price in terms of money which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale the buyer and seller each acting prudently and knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby the buyer and seller are typically motivated both parties are well informed or well advised and acting in what they consider their best interests a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market payment is made in terms of cash in united states dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto and the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions granted by anyone associated with the sale
4823345 just becuase each sale is not negotiated individually doesnt mean they have a relationship besides buyer and seller
4823346 all of the rest of them are pretty much unknown commodities davis said
4823347 jordan hemby has never played in a game johnny white and richie richh are new to the position so theyre battling were watching guys and another guy we havent talked a whole lot about this fall is tavorris jolly hes one of the players where the lights starting to come on
4823348 as soon as we finish next saturdays mock game well probably know what role each of those guys will have davis said
4823349 is one guy going to be the extra point and short field goal guy because of the trajectory
4823350 how second team players would play if they have to go into the ballgame davis said it also gave the players a chance to play against different competition
4823351 i said from the very beginning ill be accountable no decision has been made in this case except by me

4823356 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4823357 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows
4823358 everyone at pontlliw players is over the moon with the prop now weve got everything in place we cant wait for the show to begin

4823376 while indias priorities today are infrastructure education labour markets and ensuring the government doesnt fiddle much with market prices china has none of these problems instead it needs to urgently fix social security tertiary education income inequalities and environmental issues we have mooted a sensible policy priority setting process that accounts for subjectivity of interests so the output would be different across countries
4823377 the government must be an important and active player in leadership and implementation roles
4823378 let us together resolve to make this decade the decade of development
4823379 the most valuable investment that we can make in indias future is to ensure that every child gets education we have decided that by 2010 every indian child will get education up to class eight we have launched sarva shiksha abhiyan education for all campaign to achieve this goal education until graduation has been made free for women

4823485 you gotta expect the move call is going to happen and that the defense is going to try and bait you to jump offsides the ref isnt going to be able to hear that when you have 110 000 people so you have to be disciplined
4823486 i dont know if we are that good on defense or we still didnt get that much better on offense

4823548 georgias population is over 5 million compared to that south ossetia so is tiny before the conflict began it had maximum only about 40 thousand people living mainly in tskhinvali city rest of so territory is hardly populated at all mountains alpine steppe and deep forests actually it was a popular tourist destination in times of soviet union georgia wants this territory they are not interested in integration of local people who were historically and culturally always a trouble for them they are from different ethnic groups and dont mix with each other georgia almost achieved its plan of driving ossetians from their land within 24 hours period on the day of olympics opening ceremony geographically and strategically they could easily have done it once the city of tskhinvali is destroyed 2 months before the winter hits hard in that mountanious area then georgians could have upper hand of controlling the whole of that deserted area the so frozen conflict would be solved in one day and president saakashvili would fulfil his election promise emerging as a strong leader to deal next with abkhazia which is a much tougher case for georgians russians are now set to rebuild tskhinvali in almost frantic efforts because otherwise ossetian civilian population will not and could not return to destroyed infrastructure winter season is harsh in so and locals switch on their heating systems already in october the number of ossetian refugees in russia is estimated to be 32 thousand by now russians have a choice in spending their money to build winter refugee shelters on their own territory in order to feed and take care for this sudden influx of demoralized people or to try to rebuild at least sections of tskhvinvali city so that ossetians can go home georgians effectively cut tskhinvali water supplies already 3 weeks before the conflict began residents had to ship water from nearby village wells and now everything is gone gas electricity water heating system harvest trading banking schools hospitals we had repaired and rehabilitated dozens of medical points in all major towns and villages in so over the period of 8 years we helped virtually every hospital in tskhinvali the clinic in large khetagurov town which became a hub for qualified medical assistance for whole area even georgians would travel from far distances to be treated in that clinic was repaired and equipped with our help everything is gone now khetagurov resisted the night attack and was virtually leveled with ground by morning of aug 8 please note that tskhinvali city itself had no strategic military facilities to justify the all night and then whole day attacks by georgians

4823562 im really glad to see what we did because the defense has been getting the best of us and kicking our tails so far

4823574 the film establishes vanning as a stranger extremely sensitive to the transition between dark and light no doubt because he himself is in some sort of transition throughout the film vanning continues to serve as a kind of medium between dark and light 2001 236 237

4823580 nightfall shares with out of the past a narrative structure in which the motives and circumstances of the protagonist are revealed in flashback whereas out of the past has a single flashback section nightfall distributes its flashbacks over the course of the film so that the issues underlying vannings predicament are revealed progressively and become clear only fairly late in the film this delay permits tourneur to expand on the narrative ambiguity so crucial to his cinema 2001 239 240

4823628 a reader has asked me to comment on the rather alarming document reproduced on august 8 2005 in epoch times
4823629 what about the several millions of our compatriots in the united states
4823630 there are 6 7 billion humans on planet earth this equates to a statistical infection rate of 000000004215 percent in other words statistically speaking you are over 100 000 times more likely to be hit by lightning in your home than to contract the bird flu
4823631 the world is teetering on the edge of a flu pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population
4823632 an outbreak of avian influenza would kill between 5 million and 150 million people on each continent
4823633 the current u s capacity for manufacturing egg based vaccines is not sufficient to supply our entire population hhs is supporting research into human kidney cell based vaccine manufacture of producing vaccine domestically
4823634 the fda can use its emergency use authorization authority to permit the use of unapproved products if theres a reasonable belief the products may be effective
4823635 they always tell you what their going to do before they do it
4823636 you wouldnt go out to the movies you wouldnt congregate with people
4823637 youd pretty much be staying home with the doors and windows battened down
4823638 depending on how fast it is spreading it seems as though you really need to throw everything you can at it
4823639 we are not talking about simply shutting things down for a day or two like a snow day
4823640 in the context of a very infectious disease that is killing a large number of the people i think large fractions of the population wont have a problem with these recommendations
4823641 weve made significant progress not that we dont have a lot more to do
4823642 if you dont have enough resources to take care of all the patients who are critical how do you make the decisions about standard of care
4823643 if your house had been destroyed by georgians if you were left with just the clothes on your back wouldnt you do the same
4823644 im from tbilisi i was here working when the war broke out i was taken in
4823645 were feeding them were looking after them theyre all civilians their own leadership abandoned them now we want to exchange them
4823646 there are more than 40 of them they are being held so that nothing happens to them we are ready to give them to the georgian side in exchange for our men
4823647 theyre prisoners of war theyre being held according to international standards no violence is being used against them they are being fed and are being allowed to call home
4823648 the more time passes the less chance they can be identified we dont have any refrigerators at the morgue
4823649 i think the georgian side is trying to hide the extent of its casualties in south ossetia
4823650 im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4823651 kalmeer maar u deed niets verkeerd ik zou me moeten verontschuldigen mensen wakker maken hoort bij deze baan wanneer het een man is die ik uit dromenland moet halen geniet ik er zelfs van maar meisjes uit hun slaap halen dat voelt na al die jaren nog steeds even vreselijk droomt u alsjeblieft nog zacht
4823652 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4823653 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4823654 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4823655 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4823656 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4823657 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4823658 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4823659 the more one does and sees and feels the more one is able to do and the more genuine may be ones appreciation of fundamental things like home love and understanding companionship
4823660 remember this lesson history does not teach fatalism there are moments when the will of a handful of free men breaks through determinism and opens up new roads people get the history they deserve
4823661 be regular and orderly in your life like a good bourgeois so that you may be violent and original in your work
4823662 there is not in all america a more dangerous trait than the deification of mere smartness unaccompanied by any sense of moral responsibility
4823663 security is mostly a superstition it does not exist in nature nor do the children of men as a whole experience it avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure life is either a daring adventure or nothing to keep our faces toward change and behave like free spirits in the presence of fate is strength undefeatable
4823664 never interrupt someone doing what you said couldnt be done
4823665 courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace the soul that knows it not knows no release from little things knows not the livid loneliness of fear nor mountain heights where bitter joy can hear the sound of wings how can life grant us boon of living compensate for dull gray ugliness and pregnant hate unless we dare the souls dominion each time we make a choice we pay with courage to behold restless day and count it fair
4823666 im very happy for the players it was a difficult game psychologically we played at home and had to win
4823667 they were just a little bit better defensively than we were and they made the big shots
4823668 technically we feel more confident before we were losing by 20 or 30 points each match but its much better now
4823669 we fought hard to the end now we need to keep pushing ahead
4823670 los bryan ya nos advirtieron que el ambiente estaba caliente
4823671 combined the cities of san francisco oakland and berkeley employ about 3500 uniformed police officers
4823672 we thus arrive at the following remarkable conclusion it is because the one is not that the void is unique
4823673 your provider didnt act fast enough to disconnect abusers or has no clue how to install preventive measures against spammers
4823674 im the owner of this joint i choose the numbers i direct them i arrange them you have any complaints you just come to me and ill throw you right out on your ass
4823675 you may be able to use the virtual machine and template view and apply the permission to folders
4823676 whenever we play for praise and worship and it gets lousy we straightaway jump to the conclusion that its our spiritual life thats not doing well however we are being raised up by pastor c k i guess its the same for other zone pastors i mean come on we are known to be a spiritual church aside from all the negative things the rest of the world is saying about us and our spiritual level is quite there already not that its very high but of acceptable standards fact of the matter is that we miss out a big part of praise and worship called the skills we become too spiritual at times and we should focus on the skills aspect we are the ones who usher in the presence of god into the congregation skills and spirituality should come together only then will the peoples praise sound like thunder and the worship will be the sweetest aroma

4823750 we have outperformed our male colleagues at school only to be slapped hard in the real world
4823751 the hard truth is that we have failed to impress upon our own daughters that womens issues still matter
4823752 acknowledging youre a feminist is an act of gratitude for the people who went before you and fought for the rights that youre now enjoying
4823753 good guys bad guys the hite guide to smart choices
4823754 dont miss having children and none has considered marrying for the sole purpose of having children
4823755 necessarily central to the development of womens sense of her adult self
4823756 theres nothing in me that has to have a child to feel like a women
4823757 the belief that women cannot truly remain childless that we do not know what we are doing reveals a deep seated misogyny the voice that says childless women will regret their decision is the same voice that questions womens capacity to choose in any area it is the voice that undermines us as full participants in society as makers of meaning in our lives
4823758 i dont know how mothers come home from work cook and interact with their kids
4823759 its nice to come home and not have to deal with anything
4823760 i think i would be happy if i never married and i think i could also be happily married if there was a lot of mutual respect a lot of communication and if we were both clear about whats important to each of us and did not assume that itll all work out after we get married
4823761 the thought of being pregnant having a baby and being a mother just terrifies me no end

4823772 there is a frustration i feel professionally about how women who are ambitious are perceived as ruthless weve made rules weve set standards weve put virginia woolf on the curriculum and done things to make women feel its ok to go after your dreams but there is still this basic problem with women being criticized for ambition

4823880 congress originally passed the patriot act during an anthrax attack on the offices of the senate democratic majority leader and the chairman of the senate judiciary committee although the anthrax used in the attack was traced to a strain maintained by the u s army medical research institute for infectious diseases usamriid at ft detrick maryland the perpetrators were never found
4823881 the original fort detrick anthrax development program officially ended in 1972 when president nixon signed along with the soviet union and united kingdom the biological weapons convention nixon had actually ordered the pentagon to stop producing biological weapons in 1969 it now seems likely that the u s military and intelligence community failed to follow nixons orders and in fact have consistently violated a lawful treaty signed by the united states
4823882 the bbc reported that battelle memorial institute a favorite pentagon and cia contractor and for whom alibek served as biological warfare program manager in 1998 conducted a secret biological warfare test in the nevada desert using genetically modified anthrax early last september right before the terrorist attacks the bbc reported that patricks paper on sending anthrax through the mail was also part of the classified contractor work on the deadly bacterial agent
4823883 they like pod races they like gambling they like card games they go out and shoot at wamp rats in the canyons there is an entertainment industry but you wont find that out until we get to the live action show in a few years
4823884 animation is an art you either like photo realistic art and you hang that in the museum of modern art or you like something that tries to find the truth behind the realism animation is all about design style ive been making photo real movies all my life
4823885 on revenge of the sith i lamented the fact that i had to jump over the clone wars because it had nothing to do with anakin skywalker hes just another player its too bad because its like world war ii its a huge canvas there to be explored so we decided we would do a little five minute animation series for cartoon network that sort of got me into thinking we could do a regular tv show i got to fill in a blank and go around in a universe that is a little bit more lighthearted
4823886 when the first few shots came back i looked at them and said this is fantastic
4823887 i wanted to develop a character that would help anakin settle down
4823888 at the end of episode ii hes kind of a wild child and he and obi wan arent getting along so the idea was to see how they become friends how they become partners how they become a team one of the ways to do that is that when you become a teacher you have to become more responsible what i wanted to do was take anakin and force him into this thinking now i have to teach somebody now i have to be more responsible it was that juxtaposition i happen to have a couple daughters so i have a lot of experience with that particular situation
4823889 ventress was a character that was actually developed for early concept art of attack of the clones there was this idea that the sith apprentice after darth maul would be a girl that got abandoned eventually in favor of count dooku but the concept art existed the comics books and novels on the clone wars that were done before had utilized that new character when it came time to develop the series we realized that was a big fan favorite so lets draw her out
4823890 its more like indiana jones actually you have themes and things this is bigger we get to go more places the fun part about animation especially is that were allowed to go and do stories about clones we get to know them and find out what they do for recreation and find out what jabba the huts family is all about and do all kinds of things that dont have anything to do with the main character
4823891 when we started the project it was initially a television series
4823892 we needed to be able to work at a pace that was pretty rapid it was hard to get all the actors that would be off on a set you need people available every week you cant really afford multi million dollar actors to do a television series those guys make more during their coffee break
4823893 to be very honest with you i dont really think i need to hire a big movie star to publisize my movie if you like it thats fine i dont need angelina jolie here thats what it comes down to in the end they have two days in the studio and then they have like two weeks doing press they are mainly paid for the press stuff
4823894 again opportunities present themselves i wanted to do the tv series ive got about maybe 15 projects sitting here and i have to say well which one works now it makes sense for me to do these tv things so im doing some television this is one of them
4823895 its on the shelf there one of 50 projects and if i can come up with a story its very hard to come up with a story for that thing its really impossible it has to be real it has to be something that actually happens and it has to be something people know about its a really difficult research project theyre researching now and last time it took us 14 years
4823896 well i like them theyre just too long for me to sit
4823897 in some ways theyre people whove always stood in the periphery of news
4823898 now that they get to participate theyre like kids having candy for the first time
4823899 la cosa es que no puedo abrazar a un extra o cuando gano en individuales

4823901 es una alegr a compartir esta victoria con alquien con quien me llevo muy bien
4823902 venimos con un plantel completo desde luego falta nuestro capit n gerardo torrado quien est con la selecci n nacional pero este es un buen equipo y estamos ilusionados tenemos la posibilidad de llegar a la final y lo vamos a luchar hasta lo ltimo
4823903 bueno yo creo que tenemos esa gran posibilidad y la vamos a luchar hasta lo ultimo esta es una gran vitrina para los jugadores sobre todo para los jovenes van a ser bien vistos
4823904 but the whole loose trio were excellent i thought jerome kaino had his best game yet while rodney sooialo is always superb
4823905 were professionals and will pick ourselves up i think we were good in the scrums this time around but we have to realize this team is in a transition stage
4823906 for the game i want them to play its going to take some time for them to gel and click
4823907 we want to play a quick game with quick ball and the guys have to stop being afraid to do that its going to be tough along the way but the more confident the guys get the better theyll be
4823908 we created a lot of opportunities and didnt take them and thats disappointing
4823909 i am concerned for the security of our great nation not so much because of any threat from without but because of the insidious forces working from within
4823910 act like a freakin hard drive instead of glowing like an honda civic
4823911 hes lucky his wife was home because he was pinned
4823912 we continue to believe that there are attractive venture capital investments here in wisconsin and the midwest and are very excited about the opportunities ahead
4823913 the local venture capital environment continues to evolve with the quality of startups in wisconsin and the midwest being some of the best in united states
4823914 bairds new fund is a great opportunity to continue supporting wisconsin venture capital funds and to build on an existing relationship
4823915 the local nature of venture capital investments and the particular strategy of this fund make it clear they will focus on opportunities in wisconsin and the midwest
4823916 baird has generated attractive returns by executing on its focused strategy and has formed a strong investment team of experienced venture capital professionals
4823917 the support structure for early start up companies is far better today compared to when we first started investing regionally in 1999
4823918 we feel the future is bright given what has taken place over the past nine years and expect to be able to capitalize on that
4823919 i realized it was not something to be playing with

4823930 during the course of my absence from the diocese these last few weeks there has been some public interest in the alterations in the pastoral provision for the pontefract and wakefield deaneries of the diocese
4823931 the process that has lead to this decision began throughout the diocese in 2004 and was followed up with a more extensive period of consultation in the deaneries of pontefract and wakefield last autumn
4823932 in addition i have received a request for the provision of mass in the extraordinary form of the latin rite i e according to the latin missal of the venerable pope john xxiii in the pontefract deanery
4823933 i am aware of how difficult it is for people to leave familiar and much loved churches and i am very conscious of the sadness being felt at this time however as the church we need to look at the future which is being presented to us with prudence and courage and with an eye to providing realistically and therefore as effectively as possible within our means for present and future generations
4823934 we have come to deliver two petitions one is based on canon law which says that the bishop has the right to close the parishes down but it has to be done acccording to strict rules and they have not done that they are just riding roughshod over us
4823935 the second is a petition objecting to the closure of so many catholic churches in leeds and asking the authorities to think again the petition says we have no confidence in the bishop it has 1 245 signatures and that is going up by the day we are eventually going to send it to rome
4823936 after the first of the year when we began to realize wed be coming out of bankruptcy we saw a need for us to get back on our feet
4823937 the only way that could take place was to begin the process of a campaign to raise money for the needs of the diocese
4823938 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics
4823939 i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4823940 most people in the protestant community would be outraged because this is not the case at all
4823941 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me
4823942 but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4823943 what i said was what i was told and i checked it with other senior people in society and i was told this is true and i said i found it astonishing
4823944 but i was told by protestants that they were and i checked it and checked it and checked it
4823945 they nazis gave to their children an irrational hatred of jews in the same way that people in northern ireland transmitted to their children an irrational hatred for example of catholics in the same way that people give to their children an outrageous and irrational hatred of those who are of different colour and all of those things
4823946 nuala oloans remarks are very reminiscent of what mary mcaleese said about people being taught to hate or distrust catholics and these are broad sweeping generalisations which are deeply hurtful and offensive to all right thinking protestants who will not recognise them to be the case at all
4823947 remarks like this only serve to show why nuala oloan was herself distrusted by the unionist community as ombudsman
4823948 i think that as a society we need to be able to reflect on all the possible cases of divisiveness
4823949 we need to talk about it and work it out because we all worship the same god

4824263 i had heard nothing but good things about norseman and i was looking for a break from racing fast on the ironman m dot circuit norseman offered the perfect solution a race that would be an adventure and one i would need to treat with even more respect than a conventional ironman so i signed up for norseman 2008 and i was not disappointed not only is the course very difficult over 3000m of climb on the bike and 1800m in the last 17km of the run but the weather conditions change the race from year to year so you can never know exactly what you will face come race day however the fear this instilled in me made me commit to training like never before and this resulted in me having a very good day norseman is a point to point race that takes you on a spectacular journey through dramatic norwegian countryside every competitor needs their own support team and car and with weather conditions constantly changing the car needs to be full of numerous race wear options and plenty of nutrition one of the best aspects of norseman is this support crew requirement the norseman team makes it very clear at the briefing that the support crews are as important as the athletes and you soon appreciate this once you start racing my support crew was faultless and proved that organisational and motivational skills are more important than knowledge of the intricacies of triathlon racing the race begins in the dark at 3 45am when you board a car ferry along with 200 other wetsuit clad athletes this is the most surreal part of the day as you wave farewell to your support crew and settle into the bowels of the ferry for the hour long ride straight up the centre of the fjord just as it seems to be getting a little lighter you are called to the top deck and given a 10 minute warning to the start for me this was the most frightening part of the day it wasnt the 4 metre jump from the back of the car ramp that i was dreading but the temperature of the water but with five minutes to go i jumped in and was pleasantly surprised the water was beautiful 17 degrees this year and comfortable with a wetsuit and neoprene hat the ferry horn sent us on our way and soon i was swimming with clear water in front and only two others in sight we had been warned the current was against us this year so i headed for the shore and stayed close the whole way the swim is the best experience i have had in any triathlon race the water is dark but clear slightly salty and every time you breathe you catch sight of mist hovering over the water and steep mountain sides plunging down to the side of the fjord there are no buoys or markers you just swim in a straight line up the fjord towards the twinkling lights of eidfjord before making a left hand turn around a rowing boat that takes a bit of finding i exited the water 9th overall and 1st woman by around 20 minutes i knew i had had a great swim although due to the current my time was over 20 minutes slower than expected at 1 hour 18 minutes this was my sort of race with tough swimming conditions the swim seemed to mean something more than the usual warm up for the bike and run the bike course allows you a few kilometres to warm up before you head on to an old tourist road for the first 25km climb at 8 that will bring you out at the 40km mark this was my first support crew stop and i needed to layer up with a winter jacket and knee warmers from here the course takes you across the stunning hardanger plateau before you descend into geilo to hit the halfway point on the bike this stretch really cost me time it should be fast and we were lucky this year with a slight tailwind but there was driving rain for most of the way and i was getting desperately cold as i had feared it was the weather conditions that threatened my race rather than the extreme course over this section i watched the support car for number 21 coming up past me and stopping for a time check i knew this was the support car for the second woman on the road after 70km i stopped seeing them and i assumed this meant i had stretched my lead now i know they no longer needed to pass me because she was eating massive chunks out of my lead from geilo it all started to look better the sun came out and we headed on to three climbs in quick succession all between 3 5km long and 7 9 normally i am in my element on the hills but although i was able to ride strong i could no longer feel my feet or hands at the top of the middle climb i sat down at the side of the road while my selfless support crew massaged my feet and changed my socks and toe warmers although this made me feel better it was not a good sight to see number 21 heidi harviken fly over the top of the hill at high speed in full aero set up back on my bike and a little warmer i knew i couldnt match her speed on the flats or descents so i settled into riding well on the hills and trying not to lose too much time on the descents at 135km you start the last climb imingfell this stretches on for nearly 10km at 9 this climb is a classic and switches back on itself just like any good climb should i was starting to warm up now and climbed well to come back to within three minutes of heidi the top of the climb levels out across a beautiful plateau for 10km with plenty of wild flowers houses with roofs covered in grass and mountain lakes spirits rise along this part of the course as all you have left is a 30km descent into t2 but i rode badly for the last 30km i was more tired than i realised and when i hit the flatter final 10km i realised the cold had taken a real toll on me and i had very little left to give on the bike i rolled into t2 over eight mins down on heidi and very glad to see the back of my bike i knew i needed to regroup in t2 to get my race back on track but my longer than usual transition meant i went out onto the run over 15 mins down the run was beautiful and as the route quietly undulated around the side of a lake i quickly got into my running stride time checks were being made by the number 21 support crew but they were also being made by my main support man johnny and we knew we were catching her the run is mainly flat for 25km before you hit zombie hill and gaustatoppen mountain for the last 17 2km with heidi coming into sight i decided to run hard on the flat to try and put as much time as i could between us before the mountain where i had no idea how i would fare at 14km i passed her and willed myself to keep the pace up later the race organiser haarek would tell me that he thinks the smart way to race is to do exactly the opposite although on this day i dont think i would have won if heidi had me in her sights on the mountain at 18km you see the gaustatoppen mountain in front of you and you realise that 1880m is a very high race finish the stretch from 18km to 25km passed without event and i just focused on hanging in to the start of zombie hill funnily enough i felt like the race was over at zombie hill and all i had to do was walk my way up 7km of switchbacks and then the mountain this allowed me a lot of time to eat drink and reflect back on the amazing journey so far with my support crew we were all in great spirits and i was getting messages that my boyfriend richard was also having a dream race and even running parts of the hill the support from other crews and the norseman team on this hill was phenomenal and i soon found myself at the 32km mark and being directed towards a mountain top finish from 32km to 37km the road really levels out and on any normal day you wouldnt question running this road this is the one part of my performance i really regret i walked this section i walked it fast but i walked and i really wish i had run at 37km i put my backpack on and jonny and i headed off the road and on to the mountain i have never had any natural talent for walking or mountain climbing so i knew i wouldnt be making any time on this section i was content to walk my way up and savour one of the best views you will ever see people were applauding me as the first woman on the mountain but i suddenly realised that i had no idea how close heidi was a quarter of the way up the mountain we were greeted by another member of my support crew toby and i asked him to wait there and see how much time i had on heidi after too short a time the call came through to jonny that she was not far behind i really had relaxed too much so i had to leave jonny to struggle up the mountain with his very heavy backpack full of celebratory beers and make haste to the top halfway up i realised most of my food was also in his backpack and i deliriously asked a stranger for some sugar the chocolate produced gave me the final energy i needed to reach the mountain top i got to relax over the last 10 minutes when i could see that i was going to be the first woman at the top of gaustatoppen crossing the finish line after just over 14 hours was pure elation to win was a dream and it was even more special at 1880m tomato soup has never tasted so good and sharing it with richard the first non norwegian at the top and our support crew of jonny toby and piers was priceless as was the two hours it took us all to walk down from the mountain the prize for reaching the mountain top is a black finishers t shirt those who dont make the top complete the distance on a lower road and receive a white t shirt all the t shirts are presented the following morning and there are no special prizes for the winners because at norseman all finishers are winners the sheer enormity and challenge of the norseman race is what made me train and race smart and it is a race i will never forget finally i have found a race sticker that i am proud to stick to my bike box if you are looking for a race that is run across spectacular scenery and by a race crew that organise the race for the right reason a love of the sport then you must do norseman

4824292 attempts to document periods of time spent with other individuals the photographs are less about the actual experience and more about how those experiences shape your day to day and come to be in a constant state of circulation within your own mind while you drift off to sleep or daydream at your job the people you share your life with help to construct your own thoughts aspirations and ideals the correlation between breaking down the photographic plane of the image as an object and the dissection of the shared experience through over analysis produce an image which creates a platform for a furthered understanding of both areas

4824529 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job
4824530 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and bond markets rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report

4824551 anarchism is a world concept based on a a mechanical explanation of all phenomena its method of investigation is that of the exact natural sciences and every conclusion it comes to must be verified by the method by which every scientific conclusion must be verified

4824639 vi lavede en konkret pressestrategi hvor vi blandt andet sendte pjecen til l ger og samtlige barselsgange i danmark for at f budskabet ud om at vi er her men vi har ikke f et flere henvendelser siden s vi m g ud fra at l gerne ikke har pjecerne fremme
4824640 jeg mener ikke at brochurer fra lev bare skal ligge fremme jeg sorterer meget i det materiale vi har derude og det er ikke hvad som helst jeg vil have liggende
4824641 en pjece skal ramme en bred m lgruppe og underst tter ikke den dybere forst else af problemet det viser forskningen fra england
4824642 jeg f lte mig ladt i stikken og jeg oplevede en ligegyldighed fra l gerne at de nu f lte at de havde gjort deres arbejde og at vi s kunne tage hjem og finde ud af om vi ville have en abort eller ej
4824643 l gerne skal kunne komme med et tilbud om en samtale eller et telefonnummer til en organisation som gerne vil tale med og hj lpe de p g ldende for ldre
4824644 det var en god samtale jeg havde med pr sten der sagde at det kunne v re mere barmhjertigt ikke at f barnet b de overfor barnet og vores familie men samtidig manglede jeg virkelig at tale med et menneske som havde haft det her inde p livet
4824645 det kan v re vigtigt for l gerne at samarbejde med en forening som vores det kan v re sv rt for en l ge at vide hvad konsekvenserne er for et par at f et barn med downs syndrom det er netop d r vi kunne komme ind i billedet for det ved vi jo alt om
4824646 om der er nok undervisning i psykologi og etik er noget man altid kan diskutere men personligt kunne jeg godt t nke mig lidt mere
4824647 jeg mener at der er meget etik og psykologi i forvejen p studiet men der kan vel altid v re plads til mere
4824648 hvis samtalerne ikke virker p den f lelsesm ssige del synes jeg helt klart at det er v rd at se p om man kan f en psykolog tilknyttet som l gen kan henvise til
4824649 jeg har heldigvis en bekendt der er psykolog s ham brugte vi rigtig meget og det var jo et tilbud vi tilf ldigvis havde selv som vi ikke fik ved hj lp af systemet
4824650 r dgivningen skal tage udgangspunkt i den enkelte kvinde hvor er hun henne og har hun den n dvendige viden det handler om at identificere deres behov det er derfor sv rt at lave standard rutiner for hvordan man skal g re
4824651 jeg t nker stadig over p hvilket grundlag jeg traf mit endelige valg hvis jeg havde f et en bedre r dgivning havde jeg m ske i dag haft den f lelse af at jeg havde gjort hvad jeg kunne det havde givet mig en st rre ro
4824652 personligt kunne jeg godt bruge langt mere etik og psykologi i uddannelsesplanen
4824653 jeg mener at l gerne skal have mere etik og psykologi i deres uddannelse det har jeg ogs h rt fra andre sager at den f lelsesm ssige r dgivning og empati halter

4825033 my son in law mauricio and i began around 5 00 am on thursday morning from the american school for the deaf in west hartford ct actual starting point of the run for change in october it really went well not knowing what to expect from a first 50 miler i believe the run went better than i had anticipated the first 30 miles were the easiest i think it was due to the darker cooler weather the sun came up blazing at around 10 00 am and was relentless actually went up to around 80 degrees and stayed that way well into the afternoon if any of you have been in ct on a humid 80 or higher degree day some say you can drink the air we finished the first 50 miles about 2 45 pm 9 hours 45 minutes i am very happy with that time considering the unusual warm weather for this time of the year and my first 50 miles i think mauricio was happier to see jewett city than i was for me sitting in a car for about 12 hours might be harder than running 50 miles it was a great day and i am looking forward to october

4825064 colombia debe resolver tambi n si los extraditados van a ser juzgados en colombia una vez que los juzgue la justicia americana porque de lo contrario como no se les aplicar a ninguna justicia por esos cr menes entonces podr an ser procesados por el cpi

4825082 the dates are likely to correspond with payments made to the informant and the release of information from chapman to the fbi

4825106 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
4825107 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss

4825125 obviously the up tempo style of play rick promised me was never there the opportunities to play were never there and the players who were supposed to be gone by the time i came were still around
4825126 rick did a great false recruiting job on me like college recruiting where they say if you come here we promise you the world
4825127 any way we try to keep it honest here and fix our mistakes when pointed out the nyts not so much
4825128 these days they vet a story like theyre clearing up the popes bio if theres even a whisper that the story theyre considering running is a false allegation they back off as if bitten by kryptonite spiders

4825133 i have always wanted a totem pole to guard my house i would like a tall cedar log carved by a fine craftsman in the manner of the all frogs pole it would stand in the meadow near our driveway looking down on bear creek canyon and across the blackfoot to the rattlesnake wilderness the brightly painted carved figures would not represent frog they would be dog a domesticated creature with wildness not quite bred out an animal that binds us to our origins as well as to our day to day chores and pleasures
4825134 on his way up the mountain one cold morning head pounding from closing rockys the night before there was barely enough light to see but bobby knew those woods like the rusty ceiling above his cot he knew where the game trails wandered and where the stream trickled through the limestone from the spring in the high pasture downed leaves covered the path soaked after a rainy fall but frosted on top soft and brittle underfoot at the same time christmas was still a ways off but the weather had turned solitary snow flakes nested in his beard ice rimmed the creek and there were jaws of the stuff icicle teeth and all where the rocks churned the creek into foamy spray
4825135 why he felt he needed a rifle something that big i dont know

4825151 kita tidak boleh menjadi batu penghalang dengan menyampaikan fatwa atau hukum yang berpandangan pendek yang tidak menyentuh tujuan tujuan utama syariat dan tidak berdasarkan pengetahuan tentang kondisi realita kaum muslimin sehingga kita menghalangi orang dari setiap peperangan atau jihad yang sedang tegak di bumi yang dilakukan untuk mengusir serangan terhadap kaum muslimin tertindas atau tempat tempat suci mereka dengan alasan jihad tersebut mengandung unsur unsur kesalahan dan penyimpangan wahai hamba alloh jika engkau memang menginginkan jihad yang betul betul robbani yang bebas dari kotoran dan syubhat syubhat tersebut dan engkau menyayangkan nyawamu untuk kau korbankan selain untuk jihad seperti ini silahkan saja tidak ada yang boleh melarangmu sebab nyawa itu hanya satu tidak ada cadangan lain untuk coba dikorbankan di suatu tempat kemudian pindah ke tempat lain kemudian ke tempat lain hanya saja jangan sampai dirimu menghalangi orang lain untuk melakukan jihad yang terkadang dibolehkan atau bahkan diwajibkan oleh syariat hanya karena di dalam jihad itu ada beberapa kesalahan dan perbuatan tidak pantas bahkan lebih jauh saya katakan jangan sampai kamu menghalangi orang lain untuk memerangi musuh musuh alloh walau pun mereka yang berperang berasal dari kalangan orang orang yang tidak begitu istimewa atau tidak berada di atas jalan orang orang beriman bukankah kesadaran tentang jalan orang orang pendosa dan kematangan dalam memahami realita yang dihadapi kaum muslimin tidak akan tercapai kalau kita tidak ikut serta menyokong aksi perlawanan mereka dan kita tidak menjadi batu penghalang dalam medan medan pertempuran seperti ini lagi pula apa alasan untuk menyeret para pemuda yang bersemangat itu untuk menjadi lemah dan menghalangi mereka dari mengikuti aksi perlawanan seperti ini benarkah karena dorongan nasehat kepada orang yang berhak menerimanya sungguh nasehat itu bisa disampaikan tanpa harus melemahkan semangat mereka atau mengecilkan nilainya atau nilai darah yang masih terus mengalir di sana

4825179 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people
4825180 i used to go over to have lunch with doris and jim and i would sit across from jim at the kitchen table and think before me is a true american hero
4825181 there were thousands of bodies piled high i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments
4825182 they said a wife of one of the ss officers they called her the bitch of buchenwald saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner and had the skin made into a lampshade i saw that
4825183 its important that we dont allow ourselves to lose him
4825184 its the memory of heroes like james hoyt and the memories of what theyve done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations
4825185 mr hoyt as a young man saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the buchenwald concentration camp and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget
4825186 you think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had
4825187 a symbol of the chill blooded cruelty of the german nazi state
4825188 there is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th armored division on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives
4825189 at the same time a group of russians just escaped from the concentration camp burst out of the woods attempting to attack the ss men the russians were restrained and interrogated
4825190 as guides to investigate report and rejoin as rapidly as possible
4825191 i took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering ss guards and prison inmates and the latter told us of the large camp to the south
4825192 we had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp but we or at least i had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality
4825193 we were tumultuously greeted by what i was told were 21 000 men and what an incredible greeting that was
4825194 i was picked up by arms and legs thrown into the air caught thrown again caught thrown etc until i had to stop it i was getting dizzy
4825195 how the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh my but it was a great day
4825196 the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops
4825197 seeing these things it changes you i was a kid
4825198 des moines had been the furthest id ever been from home i still have horrific dreams usually someone needs help and i cant help them im in a situation where im trapped and i cant get out

4825200 memories of evil get erased for life must go on and new generations cannot be locked in the past but they would do well to remember the past
4825201 when the prisoners saw jim they picked him up and threw him in the air thats how happy they were after seeing such horrors prisoners had been hung from hooks to die he saw a lampshade made from a prisoners tattoo jim carried those horrors with him forever he never got what he had seen out of his mind if you ever wondered about jim think about what he saw
4825202 when you were discharged no one really gave a hoot about you it was difficult for a compassionate person like jim to forget what he saw he was a hero

4825256 along with other prominent black leaders such as al sharpton and barack obama farrakhan helped lead the million man march on washington
4825257 obamas supporters who clearly want to move obama as far away from farrakhan as possible will be certain to disavow that obama had any leadership role in farrakhans 1995 march

4825270 i hate to sound like an oldtimer but sometimes i get upset about the young guys
4825271 weve got guys like arn anderson barry windham ricky steamboat and michael hayes around thats a wealth of knowledge and they still have to make it mandatory for guys to show up early and go into the ring with them
4825272 when i got into the business you couldnt get me out of the building i had a burning desire to get better now the young guys seem more interested in their i pods or playing guitar hero
4825273 i see guys complaining ive been here for five years and theyre not doing anything with me
4825274 if you go to the internet theres always somebody saying this guy is the best wrestler in the world and youve got somebody else saying no this guy is the best wrestler in the world but its not about what they like its what the masses like
4825275 these guys theyre talking about are wrestling in front of 50 people not 20 000 and thats because the masses dont want to see them
4825276 i look at a guy like edge and i mean this in the nicest way hes getting to do such cool things
4825277 you know when you get into this line of work youre going to be gone a lot its really important that the time i get to spend with my family is quality time
4825278 i dont know if its softened me up but it changes the way you look at women im probably going to pay for my past

4825286 well because team 3d are evil heels who hate puppies and steal candy from children
4825287 obviously theres not enough content or time to create content for this character so they have him say a line to get the cheapest of cheap heel heat

4825295 to remember him is to feel both gratitude for the gift of his friendship and grief over its brevity in his honor we would like to plant a garden in the courtyard in the center of our school a courtyard that so many of our classes look out upon as a way of honoring his spirit and his cherished but too short life
4825296 well youve certainly come to the right place youll find no finer jeweler in hogsmeade i assure you in fact with the exception of madam tourmalines in diagon alley youll find none better in all of britain
4825297 perhaps if you tell me something about your young lady i can help you find something appropriate
4825298 i mean i want something a bo a bloke would wear yknow
4825299 well i think id like it to be sort of like well me i guess
4825300 it makes perfect sense whats the point of wearing something that isnt you
4825301 so were you thinking of something to wear around your neck on your wrist or on your finger
4825302 you see weve already narrowed the field a bit perhaps something for the wrist then we have some very nice identification bracelets and it would be quite easy to engrave your name on any one of them
4825303 how else could you come to a decision unless you see whats available we will take all the time required to be sure that you find exactly what you like
4825304 now since we seem to have eliminated necklaces and bracelets that brings us to rings that is of course unless you wanted some sort of pin
4825305 we have a wide assortment of mens rings with and without stones
4825306 you have a discerning eye sir i am quite proud of that piece and the emerald is of a rare quality there is no question of it fitting either it is from our magic fit line and will adjust itself to your finger
4825307 of course it could be fitted with a ruby or a sapphire or any stone you would
4825308 its just that i hadnt really noticed the color of your eyes before i must say its almost as if this stone was made just for you the colors match so well
4825309 i presume it doesnt need to be gift wrapped but if youll allow me ill clean it a bit and put it in a case that is of course unless you wanted to wear it out
4825310 i dont believe youve met our deputy headmistress may i present minerva mcgonagall minerva this is peridot sardonyx owner and proprietor of peridots fine jewelry here in hogsmeade
4825311 i assume you are relaxing now that another valentines day has passed
4825312 i have to admit that ive had one of the best seasons in years thanks to your students
4825313 yes i thought i saw a fair representation of your work adorning the necks wrists and hands of many of my students at lunch this afternoon
4825314 what i would like to know is how so many of our students have been visiting mr sardonyxs shop
4825315 especially as there hasnt been a hogsmeade weekend since october
4825316 she is of the opinion that the staff should be far more clever than the students that they would be able to find so many ways to bypass our rather stringent security measures keeps her up nights im afraid
4825317 after what happened to katie bell i would think that youd be more concerned for the comings and goings of the children under our care
4825318 have i ever given you reason to doubt my concern for our students
4825319 and i assure you that not one student has slipped through our net since october
4825320 every student that has surreptitiously visited hogsmeade has been under the watchful eyes of our friends
4825321 do you mean to tell me that members of the ord
4825322 and so you see not one of those who have purchased a gift from peridots shop was ever far from our protection and could have been instantly apparated to safety if the need arose
4825323 had i known that any of your students were breaking the rules i would have
4825324 you have every right to offer your services to any who come through your door the goings on at hogwarts and the cleverness of our students are not your responsibility that rests with me
4825325 with us still i have learned that no spell no stone walls and no iron bars will ever stand in the way of love
4825326 i see by the way that it has been too long since ive visited your shop many of the pieces ive seen are new since i last perused your wares
4825327 i really feel as if ive done some of my best work these last few years
4825328 i seem to remember a piece or should i say two pieces in particular that caught my eye
4825329 nearly identical save for the stones unless i am much mistaken one was emerald and one sapphire
4825330 but not quite correct it was lapis lazuli not sapphire
4825331 nevertheless they are handsome pieces you must be very proud
4825332 i have to admit myself surprised when i saw those rings gracing the hands of our misters potter and weasley
4825333 you allowed harry potter to stroll around hogsmeade when you know who is alive and trying to
4825334 that young mr potter was in no greater danger at peridots shop than he is at hogwarts
4825335 i was surprised to see the green eyed harry wearing the lapis while the blue eyed ronald wore the emerald surely you tried to convince them that the opposite was more appropriate
4825336 well i had thought that the boy who had bought the emerald was buying it for himself
4825337 he didnt want it gift wrapped and so i presumed he would be wearing it himself
4825338 our young harry has become quite adept at covering his tracks when he does not wish to divulge his plans
4825339 the other boy however ronald was it he was quite obviously buying the lapis as a gift
4825340 the eyes truly are the windows to the soul though in this case perhaps it is the heart and not the soul
4825341 after all these years i thought i had seen everything
4825342 that is a feeling ive had and set aside more times than i can count
4825343 as long as we remain at hogwarts there will always be something new and our students will continue to find ways to surprise and even amaze us
4825344 well at least now i have two people i can ask about these secret ways out of the castle
4825345 at the risk of incurring your wrath once again minerva
4825346 surely you cant expect me to ignore these blatant violations when we have proof and a witness
4825347 i wouldnt dream of ordering you to do any such thing
4825348 i only ask you to consider that harry and ron are dealing with some very new and confusing issues at the moment i think youll agree that after all they have both been through the very least we can do is give them some time to sort things out as it were i promise that when the time is right i myself will query them both concerning their means of egress from our purportedly impenetrable grounds i ask this not as a directive from the headmaster but as a personal favor to one whom i believe has earned your trust
4825349 is more binding upon me then an order from the headmaster
4825350 it shapes up to be a very good democratic year this could be one of those change elections i call them tectonic
4825351 i think the players had leaving camp on their mind
4825352 we got a little sloppy out there but theyre a good group they understand they need to pick up their intensity
4825353 at times we look good and at times were inconsistent
4825354 part of that is because were playing against a very good defense every day weve had some guys banged up and we havent goten to the level where the entire unit is progressing on a consistent basis if we were clicking on all cylinders right now id be a little worried that our defense is not in as good of shape as it should be which is not the case weve got great depth on defense weve got marquee players on the perimeter and more importantly a lot of guys who have played a lot of football games
4825355 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
4825356 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment
4825357 people are encouraged to take the leaflets and to take as many as they like they can use them or take them home for friends and spread the knowledge and awareness
4825358 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4825359 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4825360 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4825361 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4825362 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4825363 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4825364 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4825365 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4825366 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4825367 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4825368 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4825369 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4825370 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4825371 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4825372 president musharraf is confident about defending himself in the parliament and defeating the charge sheet easily because whatever he did he did in the interest of the country and for the nation
4825373 this should be clear to everyone as impeachment is a constitutional affair and that could only be done through the parliament
4825374 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4825375 theres not enough food for a humpback whale in the baltic sea
4825376 the baltic sea is a connecting sea to the north sea fish and the whale could have easily followed the current flowing into the baltic sea
4825377 it is also possible that the whale became confused because of underwater noises
4825378 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4825379 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4825380 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4825381 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4825382 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4825383 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4825384 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4825385 we had 28 turnovers and thats just a staggering number
4825386 you just dont have a chance with that many turnovers
4825387 that the power of the narcos has surpassed the power of my government
4825388 the m rida plan is just a reproduction of the failed antidrug strategies weve been using for the past 20 years
4825389 the effort and lives the mexican people are giving to this fight
4825390 much larger than their share of responsibility for the problem
4825391 these days narcos think nothing of killing us for no reason other than marking their territory
4825392 i am determined to celebrate this occasion despite all the hardships such as heat and security concerns
4825393 i feel that the situation is better now because i notice that there is more security i am happy to be here today
4825394 i hope that these measures will prevent the terrorists from carrying attacks and bombings in the holy city
4825395 a four day schedule can often be the least painful option a district has
4825396 we took our budget savings and plowed it right back into instructional content
4825397 all the evidence says the more hours our schools are open the better off our kids are
4825398 youre likely to see a lot more kids staying home alone
4825399 some people caution an eight hour day is already tough for younger kids
4825400 now that economic tides have turned this is a godsend for families where kids jobs are helping make ends meet

4825674 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4825675 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4825676 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4825686 it is what it is and you just go out and race as hard as you can
4825687 it wouldnt be anything we do any differently if we were first and if we were 20th so we go out and where it falls is where it falls and not a lot we can do in between

4825696 tan demag gico como falsario e indigno de un socialista
4825697 es de hecho el actual reequilibrio que hace que extremadura o andaluc a tengan una riqueza relativa algo mejor y que la riqueza relativa catalana ya no sea tan y tan alta con respecto a las anteriores que hace que queramos retocar la financiaci n
4825698 no est de m s recordar a mucha gente que la ideolog a no la da un carn de la ugt del psoe del psc o de cualquier partido la ideolog a es actuar y articular un discurso en base a unos principios que algunos indigentes ideol gicos olvidan cuando de dinero se trata
4825699 lo tengo claro no voy a citar al indigente pero mientras esa persona no se retracte y se disculpe por los insultos que ha lanzado contra m tach ndome de mentiroso y otras lindezas seguir considerando al mismo un indigente intelectual

4825702 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4825703 issues like russia are new so they give the media and the political observers something to talk about
4825704 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4825705 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
4825706 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
4825707 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4825708 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4825709 well take our time and look at further consequences for what russia has done
4825710 i think actually russia will care about this talk because its not just talk its about russias standing in the international community
4825711 to have limited patrols in a prescribed area within the zone of conflict not to go into georgian urban areas not to tie up the highway
4825712 now that president medvedev has reportedly signed the ceasefire agreement i assume that russian forces are going to begin to withdraw expeditiously
4825713 president sarkozy told me that president medvedev had told him that the minute georgian president mikheil saakashvili signed that document russian forces would begin to withdraw
4825714 so from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4825715 president medvedev informed members of the security council of the russian federation that he had signed the document on principles
4825716 they are not following the agreement what do they want here
4825717 i want to go to gori ive left my family there i am bringing food for them but they wont let me pass
4825718 im from tbilisi i was here working when the war broke out i was taken in
4825719 we are constantly encountering various problems with the georgian side and it will depend how quickly and effectively this problem will be solved

4825722 la politica deve tutelare tutti i diritti di tutte le persone e garantire soluzioni concrete ai problemi senza alcun tipo di discriminazione troppe sono oggi le incoerenze della politica mettiamo fine ai litigi e alle accuse tra opposizione e maggioranza e costruiamo insieme una nuova politica
4825723 tutta la nostra solidariet e sostegno al settimanale famiglia cristiana
4825724 troppi interessi ed incoerenze oggi nella politica la politica sottolinea in una nota barbera deve sempre tutelare in primo luogo tutti i diritti di tutte le persone garantendo soluzioni concrete ai problemi senza nessun tipo di discriminazione e differenze siamo stanchi dei politici preoccupati pi di criticare e di non fare piuttosto che impegnarsi nel fare politica la convivenza la sicurezza gli immigrati le relazioni tra i popoli la cooperazione ecc chiedono urgentemente risposte ben diverse da quelle che si stanno vedendo gli interessi ed il populismo sembrano sopraffare i diritti e la dignit umana approcci inutili e pericolosi
4825725 pu pure infastidire ministri e deputati di maggioranza la presa di posizione netta fatta da famiglia cristiana sulloperato de governo soprattutto se il dissenso espresso dal maggior settimanale cattolico italiano critica anche aspramente le misure sulla sicurezza sulle quali il governo ha impostato tutta la sua ricerca di consenso ma i fatti sono l osserva il presidente del cipsi lesercito presidia le citt i rom e i diversi sono colpevolizzati in quanto tali

4825758 i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god
4825759 admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is
4825760 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god

4825830 cuando google dise a android lo hace teniendo en cuenta que el segmento smartphone es interesant simo y que en l se definen gran cantidad de los usos tecnol gicos futuros que le interesan pero que est sujeto a una fort sima batalla en la que participan fabricantes de terminales desarrolladores de software y operadoras cada uno intentando arrimar el ascua a su sardina
4825831 android intenta posicionarse como una plataforma abierta sobre la que cualquiera puede desarrollar y que ni siquiera est obligado a devolver a la comunidad lo que desarrolle esto posibilita la creaci n de una base com n de dispositivos con un gran nivel de compatibilidad y muchas funciones ya asumidas por el sistema operativo pero sin impedir las posibilidades de individualizaci n de los distintos fabricantes que pueden programar lo que quieran sobre el n cleo abierto original y considerarlo parte de su diferenciaci n competitiva
4825832 i dont think that a country that behaves in the way russia has with tanks rolling across the streets of democratic countries that sort of behaviour is not compatible with being a member of the g8
4825833 russia keeps saying she wants to be a full member of the international community and part of the g8 and part of the world trade organisation and have a strong relationship with the eu european union
4825834 if she behaves like this she will have none of those things

4825836 rebecca is staying home with her robin works outside the house and i work from home he goes to work in the morning i go downstairs to my office i go upstairs at lunchtime and help put her down for her nap we rotate bedtime routine and a little perk is we rotate dates our little girl gets one on one time with one of us while the other two are having a date which is something that a lot of new parents dont get to say
4825837 we didnt do much sex stuff together but we did a lot of stuff together
4825838 i would get phone calls from either one of them

4825840 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4825841 behavioral health problems can interfere with the success of the mission especially on long duration space flights like missions to the international space station the moon and mars these self guided software tools will provide private and immediate access to treatments even though the patient may be many miles from earth
4825842 for example they emphasized the importance of regular communication regarding work publicity and education all of which provide connection to earth and helped to reduce the perception of isolation
4825843 the closest analogue to mars exploration is the exploration of earth
4825844 both maritime and terrestrial explorers struck off into the unknown often for many years at a time

4825849 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4825850 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4825851 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4825852 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up

4825854 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4825855 netsuite was a lot more cost effective than other platforms which is important for a growing company like ours
4825856 but the real beauty of netsuite is that it gives us total access to the information we need to grow our business i don t know how we would manage without netsuite
4825857 caviar is a unique product and the challenges in making and selling it are unique as well
4825858 it takes a special program to cope with all that and fortunately we ve found it in netsuite
4825859 i especially dont like the way this woman looks she has no pants on and no underwear
4825860 well everyone has them so i have to get her one
4825861 the female body is a thing of beauty the male body however is a hairy awkward mess
4825862 i am also very concerned about the medias front cover portrayal of the ideal body as being an airbrushed super sculpted creation
4825863 and we wonder why girls grow up receiving the wrong message and boys grow up thinking girls are sex objects
4825864 sounds like youre doing a fine job mothering your girls vered
4825865 its too hard to change the world and what we do in our own homes to set examples for our children to model is what matters the most
4825866 ive got two girls and would like them to grow up being confident empowered and accepting themselves for who they are
4825867 ive stopped reading womens magazines totally over the last few months
4825868 it is not an image you want your daughters to see or your sons for that matter
4825869 some people are attractive and nice to look at and some people are funny and good to listen to
4825870 teaching your children that adverts lie and that in a capitalist society everything is an advert is more useful than the specifics of how you think women should be portrayed
4825871 no one can make you feel inferior without your consent
4825872 i know i would not have made this observation desensitized or resigned as i am to how our culture portrays women
4825873 the female body is a thing of beauty the male body however is a hairy awkward mess
4825874 womens magazines tend to have beautiful women and beautiful clothes on their cover or a shirtless man with a six pack
4825875 until society changes their viewpoint we are going to continue to see these magazines
4825876 this is what i explain to my daughter when she asks actually its what i explain to her before she asks when i discover a touch up or something unrealistic no underwear i make an effort to show her this is marketing and not real life
4825877 as far as men think thats what real women are or look like i think thats crap
4825878 adults should be allowed to have things that are marketed for and to them as adults
4825879 besides giving girls a bad body image it sets up boys with unrealistic expectations
4825880 ive dreamed about being beautiful and glamorous as per their standards just for one day
4825881 its not an indicator of a culture going down the tubes its driven by money
4825882 what do you think can really be done to change it
4825883 i watch the highly intelligent and reasonable men at work dive into the newspaper to check out the sunshine girl whassup with that guys
4825884 if i was a mom i would have to approach this with my kids as if i was living in the racists south in the 1950
4825885 the double standard here is the only thing to get upset about
4825886 respect and dignity are something you earn on an individual basis and not some gender based right
4825887 i find few women my age are willing to describe themselves as such
4825888 when you see more women taking senior positions you see the incomes are more equivalent in london we have a lot of professional women women at the university and in health care and theyre more likely to be paid equivalent to their male colleagues
4825889 often the discrepancy comes in at the lower entry level positions

4826075 so liasson just flatly stated that the american people as opposed to the left wing base which is of course a different animal altogether dont want to withdraw troops from iraq within 16 months but instead favor withdrawal only when facts on the ground permit it

4826077 nearly four months ago i wrote that many journalists were going along with john mccains apparent efforts to declare that because of his military service any criticism even if it doesnt have anything to do with his service is out of bounds

4826083 two weeks ago over the objections of his lawyer and the central intelligence agency the times named the interrogator who used shrewd psychology not rough stuff to get khalid shaikh mohammed the mastermind of the 9 11 attacks to talk
4826084 hoyt addresses the fears that the interrogator was endangered because al qaeda might be out to get him and he may be right that those fears are a bit paranoid but i was surprised to see no mention of the real danger to anyone who might undermine bushs position that torture is a good thing which wont come from al qaeda but from the right wing at home
4826085 and even more astonishingly i find myself in agreement with peter beinart gosh

4826100 here is where we get to the crux of the matter i hate to put it in such stark and extreme terms but the question congress must now answer is are you with the constitution or with the president the two have become irreconcilably opposed
4826101 that such a gutting of the fourth amendment to the constitution even made it out of committee is yet another stain on the gutless and seemingly powerless democratic majority in both houses of congress
4826102 this expression of obamas intention has so many equivocations and vague claims as to be worthless
4826103 and this mornings nyt lists fisa among a number of disappointing moves from the obama philip klein at
4826104 the prospect of a nuclear armed iran is the biggest threat facing the world
4826105 im surprised that eric lichtblau got that wrong if indeed that wasnt editorial interference surely everyone should know by now that the program was
4826106 the issue is that obama has repeatedly over the course of the last year made emphatic commitments and clear statements about his own core political values that are completely irreconcilable with his support for the fisa bill
4826107 indeed this was the magic of how he defeated clinton he boxed her in on the left on the war and on the right about healthcare and just about everything else the idea that he was suddenly going to turn into chris dodd on the fisa bill is just nonsense
4826108 its absurd in other countries they look to see whether you have marijuana in your cigarette here theyll look to see if youve got cigarette in your marijuana
4826109 of course america has the meanest drug laws in the world and yet still has the obama agenda

4826113 yes the market is superstitious and that is in large part what helps inflate these incessant bubbles well that and outright lies and stupidity but its not just superstition thats causing the bubbles to pop its a confrontation with hard reality inspired by mccains offer of a pile of cash to develop a hot new battery glenn greenwald has a little list of the dumb counterproductive things obama has done in the past two weeks but hes been doing this stuff all along it has been a glaring characteristic of his campaign and im sorry some of you managed not to notice it glenn says a presidential election is a unique time when americans are engaged in a discussion over our collective political values at least more engaged than any other time why would anyone watch the obama campaign use this opportunity to perpetuate and reinforce this narrative and watch obama embrace polices that are the precise antithesis of the values he espoused in the past and not criticize or object to that criticisms of that sort arent unhealthy or counter productive theyre the opposite of course one ought to object if a political candidate even barack obama is advocating policies that trample on ones core political values or promulgating toxic narratives thats particularly true since his doing so isnt necessary to win its actually more likely to have the opposite effect there is no question at least to me that having obama beat mccain is vitally important but so too is the way that victory is achieved and what obama advocates and espouses along the way feeding distortions against someone like wesley clark in order to please joe klein and his fact free media friends or legalizing warrantless eavesdropping and protecting joint bush telecom lawbreaking or basing his campaign on demonizing moveon org and 1960s anti war hippies is quite harmful in many long lasting ways electing barack obama is a very important political priority but it isnt the only one there is and his election is less likely not more likely the more homage he pays to these tired status quo perpetuating beltway pieties glenn also has a video from russ feingold thanking us for supporting his efforts to stop the new fisa bill obama on the other hand thanked moveon for their support of his campaign by the lewis carroll decision

4826163 not because he has any grand statement to offer but simply to take his mind off the existential horror of being alive
4826164 i cant really come up with a good argument to choose life over death except that im too scared
4826165 your perception of time changes as you get older because you see how brief everything is you see how meaningless i dont want to depress you but its a meaningless little flicker you have a meal or you listen to a piece of music and its a pleasurable thing but it doesnt accrue to anything
4826166 there are no other words that i can think of to describe life other than futile and worthless really when you think about it what the hell are all of us doing here we go through school which everyone despises but supposedly its beneficial we get a career which most people hate and they end up wasting their lives on things that dont really matter so what the hell are we doing sure there are some good times fond memories but they all end everything good or worth anything ends at one point nothing can be relied upon you may think that you have your life figured out and everything may be peachy keen for a while but just wait and see life will throw you a curveball guaranteed there is absolutely no doubt that your life will truly suck and not just once repeatedly over and over you know why because lifes a bitch and then you die
4826167 i know that i have felt and still remotely feel that the good things in life seem to be constantly squashed by the shit but i have also realized that while some good things are temporary so are the bad things nothing in life is ever definite without the possibility of it being changed
4826168 is this all there is to life this is it
4826169 this is all there is and life is shit i would kill myself but i dont have the guts

4826172 from 8 30 9 30 on monday i have the offense on just personnel 9 30 to 10 30 on monday im going to be with the defense just personnel from 10 30 to 11 30 on monday im going to meet with brian polian just on special teams just personnel
4826173 those issues are major issues that were confronted with at this stage
4826174 youre getting closer to flipping the switch to when you starting carding stuff when you start having show teams instead of just going offense against defense you have to have already in your mind tentative depth chart is a guy a four or three is he a three or a two is that guy a one or a two or is he moved down to a three you have that initial depth chart and it changes on a day to day basis some of it is also dictated by guys getting banged up
4826175 some of them would have happened regardless of what you were doing but having more we probably have three or four guys right now whose heads are dinged right now
4826176 fortunately knock on wood anyone weve had tweaked its just days we dont have anyone who looks like theyre going to be out
4826177 there were times that there were things that clausen didnt understand but i think that there were so many different factors that lead to a total
4826178 some of them are physical some of them are mental on his part and some of them are mental on other peoples part and then some of them are playcall its a collection of all of those things
4826179 for example he might have known what to do but lets say a tight end doesnt sight adjust or doesnt hot depending on whether its a six man protection or a seven man protection and hes looking to throw it to him and the guy doesnt see it
4826180 but then theres other times where its a fire drill thats in your face right now and youre throwing the ball away not knowing whether or not you can even throw an incomplete pass
4826181 thats a bad idea to throw the ball away that time and sometimes taking a sack is the right thing to do its a cumulative effect of all of those things added together he was certainly part of the problem but he was by far not the only part of that problem
4826182 another thing is youve got to be able to pick up the blitz and were certainly seeing enough of it in training camp
4826183 at this stage right now theres a wide separation between evan and dayne
4826184 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none

4826186 its right up there with worst ideas in the history of modern education
4826187 we could end up arming half the gangs in houston
4826188 it is foolish to introduce more weapons into the school environment even under the guise of wanting to provide better protection for our students
4826189 staff would have to be constantly concerned with weapon security and retention thus taking away from their ability to focus on their main goal teaching students
4826190 whether an educator could really handle a weapon effectively in a crisis situation
4826191 a group of liberal and far left activists far more interested in gay rights and abortion rights than christian evangelism
4826192 guys like rick warren and olsten are making the most radical pro abort democrats acceptable to evangelicals i have no use for his purpose driven life agenda which is really theological liberalism dressed up for the post modern world
4826193 you want to know how i did it this is how i did it anton i never saved anything for the swim back
4826194 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind

4826205 sustainable development stands for meeting the needs of present generations without jeopardizing the ability of futures generations to meet their own needs in other words a better quality of life for everyone now and for generations to come it offers a vision of progress that integrates immediate and longer term objectives local and global action and regards social economic and environmental issues as inseparable and interdependent components of human progress sustainable development will not be brought about by policies only it must be taken up by society at large as a principle guiding the many choices each citizen makes every day as well as the big political and economic decisions that have this requires profound changes in thinking in economic and social structures and in consumption and production patterns
4826206 gradually change our current unsustainable consumption and production patterns and move towards a better integrated approach to policy making it will reaffirm the need for global solidarity and recognizes the importance of strengthening our work with partners outside the eu including those rapidly developing countries which will have a significant impact on global sustainable development
4826207 a host of cultural economic social and psychological factors affect the way we behave often locking us into unsustainable consumption habits even those who say they will buy organic food for environmental reasons and the good of their own health may change their minds if products outstrip their budget
4826208 putin is not hitler or stalin he is not even leonid brezhnev he is what he is and that is bad enough in the 2008 election he made a joke of democratic procedure and in effect engineered for himself an anti constitutional third term the press the parliament the judiciary the business lite are all in his pocket and there is no opposition but putin also knows that russia cannot bear the cost of reconstituting empire or the gulag it depends on the west as a market one lesson of the soviet experience is that isolation ends in poverty putins is a new and subtler game he is the autocrat who calls on the widow of aleksandr solzhenitsyn to deal with him will require statecraft of a kind that has proved well beyond the capacities of our current practitioners

4826223 the governments of the world must be pressured to demand that the u n adopt a clear resolution or law that categorically prohibits affronts to prophets to the prophets of the lord and his messengers to his holy books and to the religious holy places
4826224 objectively speaking the cartoon controversy was a tempest in a teacup but subjectively it was a show of strength and in the context of the clash of civilizations a dress rehearsal for the real thing the muslims demonstrated how quickly and effectively they can mobilize the masses and the free west showed that it has nothing to counter the offensive nothing but fear cowardice and an overriding concern about the balance of trade now the islamists know that they are dealing with a paper tiger whose roar is nothing but a tape recording
4826225 the media must transform diversity which is a fact of life into pluralism which is a set of values
4826226 promoting and defending diversity is the task of the media
4826227 there is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence
4826228 europeans had to kneel at the feet of muslim scholars in order to access their own scholastic heritage
4826229 in recent years representatives of some muslim states have demanded and often received special treatment at the united nations
4826230 non diplomatic terms such as blasphemy and defamation of islam have seeped into the united nations system leading to a situation in which non muslim governments accept certain rules of conduct in conformity with islamic law the sharia and acquiesce to a self imposed silence regarding topics touching on islam
4826231 we are encouraged to see however that an awareness of the dangers of islamophobia is gradually setting in the west the condemnation by many western leaders and governments of islamophobic acts such as the dutch movie fitna are positive confidence building measures that lead us to believe that all is not lost and that the gap can be closed in time but mere condemnation or distancing from the acts of the perpetrators of islamophobia will not resolve the issue as long as they remain free to carry on with their campaign of incitement and provocation on the plea of freedom of expression
4826232 obviously the intention of the oic is to do everything within its power to make sure that the citizens of the western democracies do not remain free
4826233 europes politicians are determined to avoid asking the people their opinion and they are right to do so
4826234 again and again they trick their populations into accepting the european union its been going on for 50 years politicians making policy against the people the only time anyone ever notices is when the people one people in this case are asked for their opinion it happened in ireland recently when the irish made it clear that they refuse to accept the politics of scoundrels
4826235 she is in fact wholeheartedly behind a strengthening of the european union perhaps even knowingly against the wishes of german citizens
4826236 perhaps the eus secret strategy is called strategic boredom attract no attention and make no waves but continue to plod along quietly and stubbornly ignoring the murmurs of concern from all around the scoundrels in brussels have sold the european people a lot of things a single market the euro the lifting of many border controls and most recently a binding global climate policy these have all been good things and they have helped make europe an eminently livable continent despite the many dull moments and emotions that have been negative at best the end result has been laudable most of these improvements would have been held up if not outright prevented by referendums democracy doesnt mean having unlimited confidence in citizens sometimes the big picture is in better hands when politicians are running it and a big picture takes time
4826237 freedom of speech should not be used as a freedom to insult
4826238 freedom of expression is exactly the freedom to insult anyone within the framework of the law
4826239 develop their language skills to promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue international understanding and to combat prejudice and all forms of racism and xenophobia
4826240 within the formal curriculum the intercultural dimension straddles all subjects history language education and the teaching of religious and convictional facts are perhaps among the most relevant
4826241 in 2007 the european ministers of education underlined the importance of measures to improve understanding between cultural and or religious communities through school education
4826242 youth and sport organisations together with religious communities are particularly well placed to advance intercultural dialogue in a non formal education context
4826243 educators at all levels play an essential role in fostering intercultural dialogue and in preparing future generations for dialogue
4826244 kindergartens schools youth clubs and youth activities in general are key sites for intercultural learning and dialogue
4826245 the workplace should not be ignored as a site for intercultural dialogue
4826246 public debate has to be marked by respect for cultural diversity public displays of racism xenophobia or any other form of intolerance must be rejected and condemned in accordance with the relevant provisions of the european convention on human rights irrespective of whether they originate with bearers of public office or in civil society every form of stigmatisation of persons belonging to minority and disadvantaged groups in public discourse needs to be ruled out the media can make a positive contribution to the fight against intolerance especially where they foster a culture of understanding between members of different ethnic cultural linguistic and religious communities media professionals should reflect on the problem of intolerance in the increasingly multicultural and multi ethnic environment of the member states and on the measures which they might take to promote tolerance mutual understanding and respect states should have robust legislation to outlaw hate speech and racist xenophobic homophobic antisemitic islamophobic and antigypsy or other expressions where this incites hatred or violence members of the criminal justice system should be well trained to implement and uphold such legislation independent national anti discrimination bodies or similar structures should also be in place to scrutinise the effectiveness of such legislation
4826247 the council of europe together with media professionals and journalism training institutions is launching in 2008 a campaign against discrimination bringing into focus the role of the media in a multicultural europe journalism promoted in a responsible manner through codes of ethics as advanced by the media industry itself and a culture sensitive training of journalists can help provide fora for intercultural dialogue

4826249 we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed
4826250 that sounds like the statement of a victor in a war dictating terms to the vanquished
4826251 we have established an oic group in washington d c ihsanoglu
4826252 and in confronting the danish cartoons and the dutch film fitna which showed muslims acting on violent passages in the quran ihsanoglu continued we sent a clear message to the west regarding the red lines that should not be crossed ihsanoglu says its already working as we speak the official west and its public opinion are all now well aware of the sensitivities of these issues they have also started to look seriously into the question of freedom of expression from the perspective of its inherent responsibility which should not be overlooked in other words irresponsible speech which is defined as speech he disagrees with should be banned
4826253 can honest discussion really be outlawed you bet it can as long as free people do nothing to stop it from happening as the oic presses american politicians to use anti discrimination and hate speech laws to stem this illegal trend we need to stand up now with mark steyn and all the others who are on the front lines of this battle and tell them that what theyre doing to steyn in canada must never happen here we must tell our elected officials to stop this outrage resist oic lobbying and reaffirm in no uncertain terms our commitment to free speech particularly now when so much depends on our being able to speak with honesty about the nature of the jihadist threat and so many powerful entities want to make sure we do not do so so much depends on this possibly even including our survival as a free people
4826254 it is not clear to me that the europeans are mistaken
4826255 when they say that a liberal democracy must take affirmative responsibility for protecting the atmosphere of mutual respect against certain forms of vicious attack

4826260 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4826261 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4826262 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4826263 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4826264 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4826265 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4826266 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4826269 we are delighted with the car it has come together exceptionally well
4826270 we have drawn heavily on our extensive world rally car experience running the hyundai wrc programmes plus our more recent experience developing the mg s2000 sport to create what we believe will be a very competitive super 2000 car that can challenge the peugeot and fiat equivalents we have some good experience with super 2000 having now developed two cars for two different manufacturers
4826271 we are in advanced discussions with several teams for programmes with backing of various national opel sales offices
4826272 despite there being no official opel presence in the wrc in recent years the brand still has a strong rally culture super 2000 is the rally car category of the future and we are delighted to have produced a super 2000 car based on one of the most popular cars on sales today
4826273 i see this as an example of an employer not so subtly pressuring workers to either hide their political beliefs or to falsify them for the benefit of their employers
4826274 wal mart rejects the suggestion that they are telling associates how to vote but as i point out in my book one of the biggest employee free speech concerns is the chill that employer pressure to conform can place on worker free expression
4826275 whether or not this turns out to amount to a technical violation of federal election commission rules it is sophistry to suggest that this kind of message from an employer doesnt have a chilling effect on the political and expressive rights of these employees its possible that they could find themselves disadvantaged if they express political views that happen to differ from those of a powerful corporate employer
4826276 es necesario rodear a la corte para que nuestra sociedad de una vez por todas extirpe este mal que carcome nuestras instituciones democr ticas

4826278 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
4826279 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
4826280 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
4826281 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group

4826293 why have you brought us out into the wilderness to die
4826294 and moses returned to the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold yet now if you will forgive their sin and if not blot me i beg you from your book which you have written
4826295 please god let me cross over and see the good land that is beyond the jordan the goodly mountain and the lebanon
4826296 the name of and the opening word of this weeks torah reading in gematria
4826297 is it possible that moses would pray for something just for himself highly unlikely rather mosess prayer comes to emphasize the depth of his loss that he could not enter israel and thereby cause the land of israel to be even more precious to the people so that as a result the people will not sin and they wont lose the land as moses himself lost the land
4826298 keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations who when they shall hear all these statutes shall say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people
4826299 there shall be one law for the citizen and the stranger alike
4826300 koffi annan the secretary general of the united nations put it succinctly
4826301 that israel is right and the whole world is wrong
4826302 you bet your life it is you bet your life because weve bet our lives it is true now and it always has been
4826303 the nations are but a drop in a bucket reckoned as dust on a balance
4826304 and you shall do that which is right and good in the eyes of the lord so that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the lord swore to your fathers
4826305 never again will judah or jerusalem hear the sounds of joy and the voices of gladness the song of the bride and grooms
4826306 what is right and good in the eyes of the lord
4826307 what is hateful to you do not do to your neighbour that is the whole torah the rest is commentary now go study the commentary
4826308 the e mail sent yesterday afternoon and obtained by the globe warned mbta computer users to
4826309 i understand the working class people might need a raise to keep up with the cost of living but for senior executives its hard to swallow

4826314 with their talent and experience we expect that these celebrities would connect the campaign with the people making it a peoples movement they are also seriously involved in the campaign without charging any remuneration
4826315 we would discuss an idea exchange notes with aamir khan on how to sensitise people against harassment of tourists particularly women tourists we would also safeguard the rich cultural heritage of the country while promoting tourism
4826316 what a relief it is to drink a good french wine
4826317 i thought of bottle shock because the french have not really changed their minds about california wine they may be polite about it in public and may even have invested in california vineyards but the private disdain persists
4826318 later he expanded that to include the image of himself as a conductor of an orchestra but even then he conceded the score is already written
4826319 we were completely open with each other about everything and had nothing to hide
4826320 however singhanas current boyfriend project consultant deep parmar doesnt share the same notions of openness
4826321 its what i perceive my partner will do with my password or phone if i feel her intentions are harmless and she simply wants to send a mail or check a message for fun id be willing to share however if i feel she might snoop id never give it to her
4826322 which is why i hate anyone going through my messages whether its my parents or my girlfriend lest it cause unnecessary arguments
4826323 two years after our marriage we went through a rough patch and i started to share my feelings with one of my ex boyfriends through email sohail grew suspicious and checked my mails where i had revealed intimate details about my marriage to my ex
4826324 a nasty fight ensued and the two have never shared their passwords again when spouses share everything from the bedroom to the bathroom space and privacy are issues that need to be negotiated carefully believes dr mirchandani
4826325 partners have to work out what is more important to them their privacy or their relationship
4826326 while there is always a seed of suspicion in any relationship we consciously avoid sharing passwords or leaving our phones with each other
4826327 even if they happen to reveal their passwords they ensure that they change them soon after
4826328 it doesnt mean that we dont trust each other or have something to hide
4826329 but we prefer avoiding any uncomfortable questions that may arise after we snoop
4826330 thats when i knew he had nothing to hide from me
4826331 often the partner confronts the other with the allegations of betrayal and both partners feel like the victim the partner who collects the evidence feels betrayed because of the traces they had found of their partners intimate communication with another individual and the other person feels violated because of the spying
4826332 just like guys dont like letting others drive their car i dont like my partner or for that matter anyone fiddling with my cell phone this doesnt necessarily mean im hiding something
4826333 if his phone is such an important part of his life then so should i be
4826334 unfriendly reception are we going to let each other into every aspect of our personal lives or are there certain parts that we would like to keep sacred
4826335 some people are extremely suspicious by nature and will constantly intrude on their partners private communication leading to misunderstandings such people suffer from paranoia which must be treated with therapy and counselling
4826336 i became even more suspicious of my next few girlfriends
4826337 ive noticed several sell like 100 1 and stuff like that i figured small bidding wars go on it doesnt surprise me i got caught off guard in a little bidding war recently on camino miraval so

4826351 we met allen and peter orlovsky on a sunday morning in 1962 in coffee house we hadnt seen such sahibs before with torn clothes cheap rubber chappals and a jhola and we were quite curious
4826352 slowly they drifted into our group allen had introduced peter as his wife and we were quite surprised at the masculine manner in which he had said that
4826353 ginsberg left an important impact on bangla poetry and opened doors with language thought processes and belief systems that contributed to the process of growing up and becoming modern
4826354 ginsbergs time in india was a search for god and running away from his personal demons and he became a vehicle through which i could explore the relations between india and america
4826355 without the music of jimi hendrix i might never have been so inspired to explore the music possibilities and push the envelope of the guitar

4826453 im not going to do something unless there is a reasonable chance to make it happen
4826454 were talking about reducing the risk of a potential buyer making the sale contingent on the license
4826455 we strategized about a number of issues today i recognize how important an acute care hospital is to this community we talked about how we could facilitate that if we find a viable buyer
4826456 we appreciate the people coming out it was a great day the atmosphere was really fun weve got to show them something on the 28th thats the main thing we really do appreciate their energy they brought to the scrimmage
4826457 i thought defensively we came out with a lot of energy ready to play ready to perform offensively we kept waiting for something to happen to get us going something happened it just wasnt good it got us going alright it just got us going in the wrong direction from an offensive standpoint you have to come out and create your momentum that was probably the learning lesson for today when we step that last foot off the ramp weve got to be ready to play im not sure we were as mentally prepared as we needed to be this morning
4826458 wed rather have it now than the 28th and thats the main thing well have one more good scrimmage next thursday under the lights i certainly expect that to be a lot better from that standpoint turnovers so we just need to learn and grown at the same time it makes you sick to your stomach because the one thing you cant do is help the other football team you dont want self inflected wounds some of those were self inflected some we just didnt do a good job at securing the ball thats something thats certainly on our minds because if you win the turnover battle youre going to win the game most of the time
4826459 weve got some good football players and they did a good job of playing their side of the ball we had some guys that played well offensively its just we had some bumps in the road that make you have a bad taste it your mouth weve just got to correct it and move forward
4826460 once they got warmed up and got going they looked good you cant let the atmosphere control your performance i feel like that was a little bit of the case early in the scrimmage especially with some of the younger guys
4826461 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4826462 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009
4826463 changing the competitive landscape for 2009 is just code for
4826464 i smile a lot more now that i am doing this show because i feel i am on a show that is good i am on a show that i can be a fan of
4826465 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4826466 stories told through battles with dozens of new creatures and hundreds of new quests
4826467 it is such a privilege to announce the upcoming expansions for two of our most popular games everquest and everquest ii in a venue like fan faire where we are joined by thousands of our loyal fans and it seems more than appropriate to give those fans access to both of the expansions for free
4826468 both of these expansions are rich in content and adventure and will provide our players with hours of excitement as they explore the online world of norrath
4826469 the only thing we can do is go out and play to our highest ability and play to what we are capable of i think we are all excited for this opportunity to prove we can get it done
4826470 i am not officially the starter for the season but i feel confident that i can be the starter and i am excited for the opportunity
4826471 there have been flashes and i think youll see some moments when youll say
4826472 kevin boss is going to be a good receiver hes going to make a lot of catches i think he is going to be the first one to tell you that he needs to continue to work on his blocking
4826473 kevin has a big role to fill and hes still got a lot to learn in becoming a big playmaker for us
4826474 last year when we lost shockey we did some more four wide receiver stuff when we got into passing downs we put steve smith in the tight end position and let him do some of the things that we tried to do with shockey well see how we manage but hopefully a whole lot wont change and well still use a lot of tight end formations kevin will have to step up
4826475 the attempt to slumber triggers a physiological sharpening of the uncomfortability sensory receptors
4826476 what would the world be like if nobody did a job they didnt want to do
4826477 epa plans to release an advance notice of proposed rulemaking emissions
4826478 the largest aviation market in the world is burning less fuel today than in 2000
4826479 the virtual elmination of what little effectiveness there is in this already weak rule
4826480 we welcome the joint shadow report published today it clearly highlights that same sex couples and their children are being failed by the state
4826481 civil partnership as laid out in the heads of the bill will give rise to further discrimination against same sex couples as it is the only option available to them and is not available to opposite sex couples it is a separate institution and it therefore reinforces inequality and segregation
4826482 the law has wreaked havoc on same sex couples lives because too many employers hospitals and others throughout the state do not recognize a civil union as marriage
4826483 they dont believe the legislature intended it to be equal
4826484 when they are taunted or asked in a hostile way why their parents have something inferior why they arent equal thats psychologically damaging
4826485 the irony is that new jersey was the national leader in letting gay couples adopt why would the state then turn around and send a signal to those children that their parents cant marry its been our biggest heartbreak
4826486 its not going to affect britney spears ability to continuously get married
4826487 republican leader newt gingrich has been married three times and it wasnt because of same sex marriage
4826488 the threats are unemployment a bad economy financial pressures emotional pressures but marriage is not a threat to marriage ive asked opponents to show me one straight couple just one whose marriage would fall apart because a gay couple got married they cant
4826489 interestingly the state with the lowest divorce rate in the country is massachusetts the first state that allowed same sex couples to marry canada which allows same sex marriage and where goldstein and his partner were married has a divorce rate one half the u s rate
4826490 new jerseyans care about the economy which affects them personally
4826491 they care about gas prices they care about property taxes they care about government corruption do they care about depriving me and my partner of equality no they dont the state is much fairer than that
4826492 it would be another nail in the coffin of the idea that marriage by gay people would hurt straight marriage
4826493 the government wasted their opportunity to legitimise same sex relationships they have failed us on many levels what we want isnt radical or complicated put simply we want equality he continued i would urge as many people as possible to sign up to the youre not out until youre out to your td campaign visit the marriagequality website www marriagequality ie action where a range of information is available to help you make the most of your visits this isnt just for gay men and lesbians it is for the everyone who believes in the human right of marriage being extended to adults who wish to marry regardless of their sexuality
4826494 lesbian and gay couples living in ireland who wish to marry and have their relationships families and children recognised and protected by the constitution cannot do so under current law action is needed now the people of ireland must have their voice heard on this subject extending civil marriage to same sex couples will only serve to strengthen the institution of marriage
4826495 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4826496 we will be gone at the end of the year
4826497 the public at large really does think why havent people moved on
4826498 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4826499 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4826500 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4826501 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4826502 we are also extremely appreciative of the support we have received from people here in beijing the united states new zealand and around the world
4826503 the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4826504 you should see how sweaty i get when i run
4826505 the family has been given voucher of 2000 00 and apartment has been found in lynn but they refused to take it
4826506 if we are to achieve a richer culture rich in contrasting values we must recognize the whole gamut of human potentialities and so weave a less arbitrary social fabric one in which each diverse human gift will find a fitting place
4826507 right after the next song we need to go home
4826508 im so happy to be here with so many beautiful and talented girls
4826509 what if someones mom saw this how would they take it
4826510 we would like to congratulate you for your graduation your degree will be arriving in the mail by early october

4826513 the housing bust is fully upon us and the job losses associated with this housing bust continue to accrue and are showing up in these unemployment figures
4826514 is strengthening floridas economy by providing vital support to our states businesses and job seekers
4826515 this isnt a broad scale across the board unemployment situation there still are areas doing well
4826516 this can be done with a city council that can provide a welcome mat to business and industries
4826517 it was the first year i didnt get up on the separator any more i had to quit
4826518 i felt kind of foolish because i was walking around doing nothing
4826519 i think he said they have to learn the hard way
4826520 he learned the easy way you know because he grew up with it
4826521 bob is nothing but a hard worker and a good gentleman hes been one of my best friends all my life
4826522 i tell you what when he was out there he could actually work faster than i could hes always been just as fast or faster and doing good work
4826523 if you just sit in a rocking chair you get old a lot faster
4826524 its the old people who are walking around and looking
4826525 we have a record on this not just a plan
4826526 it makes achieving energy independence something we can actually do
4826527 you cant talk about an apollo program if youre not willing to look at our domestic supply if youre not willing to look at nuclear energy
4826528 he received more money from big oil than any other politician in the history of minnesota
4826529 the governor has said several times he intends to support the repeal if it passes
4826530 in poll after poll the issue has gained mainstream support
4826531 the california ruling was a wake up call for massachusetts
4826532 we had to remove the last vestige of marriage discrimination on the books here
4826533 this law was deemed to be credible by our state courts just two years ago
4826534 theres no credible evidence that this law had any racist motivation
4826535 we think this issue has lost some of its edge
4826536 its just not a big deal americans look at this and they wonder why these groups are constantly talking about gay marriage when gas prices and the war in iraq are so much more critical
4826537 from the wright brothers to the right solutions curbing soaring aviation emissions
4826538 represent an increasing and potent source of greenhouse gas emissions due in part to the unprecedented growth in air travel
4826539 recent reports show that at altitude aircraft emissions have a greater impact on global warming than previously understood
4826540 u s aviation emissions have declined in recent years but due to the expected increase in air traffic and lead times for technology change it could prove challenging to continue this declining trend
4826541 cannot let aviation fly under the radar the impact of these emissions cannot be ignored
4826542 aviation must answer for the heat trappings of their own success
4826543 as local governments and other nations move to limit the impact of aviation on the environment congress cannot linger in a holding pattern
4826544 the u s and other nations have expressed serious concern about the legality of the proposed eu legislation in the context of both the chicago convention of 1944 which established the international civil aviation organization and bilateral air services agreements
4826545 there appears to be a disconnect between perception and performance on aviation emissions at least in the u s
4826546 in some quarters there is a perception that aviation greenhouse gas emissions are growing out of control and that it needs to be reigned in by emissions caps and taxes
4826547 the icai celebrating its diamond jubilee year will setup the museum with an aim to provide a journey through various stages of the glorious past of the chartered accountants ca profession in india and the conception and growth of the institute
4826548 it will be a source of inspiration learning reference and professional pride for all those who are associated with accountancy profession including students and institute members it will also showcase historic press clippings mementoes documents photographs paintings handicrafts stamps video shoots posters etc related to accountancy profession in india it is a heritage that needs to be preserved and shared with others

4826552 it might be cold but i love being out here in the country
4826553 its gritty it feels like the original texas chain saw massacre
4826554 i didnt meet the director until a year after i said i wanted to do it actually we met up at the chateau marmont in los angeles draining whiskies and smoking cigarettes for three hours
4826555 and actually i think it turned out to be my longest meeting ever i wonder why
4826556 seriously though at the end it was a done deal really a script like this comes along once every blue moon
4826557 i dont feel as torn as i did once i used to harbour that dream of running away from it all moving to the countryside and having lots of babies i no longer feel that longing for family or for stability now that i have my son and can take him with me on set i can focus differently
4826558 now we have sex and the city tours pulling up outside the house its great out here though were staying in a country club and he loves the golf cart he calls it a tractor and during my days off i have to spend the whole day driving around on this golf cart which goes about three miles per hour
4826559 because id taken such a long break and had been pregnant and had my son it was the first time in my career id been working non stop since i was 14 years old that i could enjoy a really interesting reflective period
4826560 during the pregnancy and milos birth i was in bliss having that break and just being a mommy and feeling all those things through the first period in his life and while i wasnt freaking out about not working i was offered two things i really wanted just after he was born but hed have been three weeks old and id have to stop breastfeeding and go straight to work i was ready to get back and you have to remember that with a lot of those films like reign over me it was nice to just get back to work while being a mum so you want smaller supporting roles those kinds of parts were important for me then especially after spending so long working on the lord of the rings
4826561 i know that sounds lame but that was four years of our lives going back and forth to new zealand and every christmas wed go and promote the films it was amazing but when that was over i definitely felt a little empty and wanted to be a normal person for a while
4826562 i still see orlando bloom and i email dominic monaghan plus peter and fran jackson the director and his wife cum creative partner
4826563 id love to work with them again but i was really homesick when i made that movie i was madly in love with roy then and he was in new york a lot and that seemed too far away from new zealand so though i enjoyed the experience the place is so beautiful i felt a little alone out there
4826564 really though as soon as i had milo i was like please send me back
4826565 hey i learned to swordfight in the first films and didnt get to show my skills
4826566 milo loves it down here hes been living with me here on set he was such a treat because im working every day i thought it would be hard not see him but he was so fine and so independent its kind of hard being in manhattan with all the tourists and the paparazzi outside your house yet down here shooting in the south even if they recognise you they never treat you like a zoo animal
4826567 my job with givenchy is like being the avon lady
4826568 i just scoot around the world going from one country to the next
4826569 and while with stealing beauty i was in almost every scene its not like this its been amazing to play a character with all these different layers and to see everything come through normally i put that much preparation into a film but you dont always see that on screen
4826570 i also love it that its not very glossy and stylish it feels like one of those grittier 1970s films like texas chain saw massacre or friday the 13th and theyre shooting it in a really interesting way theres a lot of movement and were often not captured squarely in the frame best of all though not only is it harrowing things dont always turn out like youd expect
4826571 i just opened my mouth and this huge manly roar came out
4826572 but its still an incredible event having 30 000 people for a candlelight vigil
4826573 its a common question are you going to put the upstairs on tour and the answer is no
4826574 it was a private living quarters for the presley family and it remains that way today
4826575 people are respectful of that when you go through graceland you dont feel like youre entering a museum its a feeling of a home
4826576 lets step back if abstraction helps then lets see what can be abstracted how can we eliminate all redundancy can we abstract the process of abstracting
4826577 sai nana in mezzo a qualunque folla io mi trovi in qualunque forma tu appaia
4826578 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
4826579 intre sacru si profan intre eteric si neo clasic intre muzica veche si contemporana
4826580 its dangerous we are getting complaints from people who work in that area on piedmont avenue
4826581 theres been no injuries because of our occupation of the median
4826582 we are careful and we are respectful of the neighbors and the large forces in the world such as the trucks and cars and buses
4826583 the university built the first fence last august and the second fence in november and then when they put up the barricades they thought they could get rid of us
4826584 but we wont go away the fact is we are holding this space its still our grove and we arent going anywhere
4826585 i think it would be appropriate for the city to take action its a city ordinance trespassing illegal lodging they are violating
4826586 from our perspective our primary concern is safety and it doesnt appear there is an urgent safety issue there
4826587 if and when it becomes necessary we will take appropriate action at the appropriate time
4826588 there are businesses that are friendly toward us and let people use the bathrooms and i think in general people are supportive we try to maintain good relationships with the neighbors
4826589 how poor are they that have not patience what wound did ever heal but by degrees
4826590 most people dont bother to stop by their vets office to pick up their pets file
4826591 i didnt i just have a copy of everything my vet has at my house in case of emergency
4826592 look were here because elton needs a special type of iv fluid it says it on the paper mike gave you when we arrived hes not dying he needs more protein
4826593 you see here where it says that he has a mass in his intestines thats potentially fatal
4826594 yeah and you see the date on that little fact sheet there thats from last week as in the blockage has been removed as in he no longer has the blockage as in id like to speak to a real vet
4826595 feels like that girl you used to know who had an eating disorder
4826596 i know some of you will thumb through the book and go directly to the end to find out what happens
4826597 well dont waste your time because that is not the way i write
4826598 r amp b music had always consisted of love songs now songwriters started exploring the color barrier with their songs papa was a rolling stone and love child come to mind as examples of this shift
4826599 i told the guys that rich and i would go out and warm up the crowd with some comedy
4826600 and then we would play or attempt to play the tunes we rehearsed one bit melted into the next until we ended the show and had both forgotten entirely about the band sitting behind their instruments waiting to play
4826601 if i think we could make the movies like up in smoke today and i tell them no i was incarcerated for nine months simply because i made those movies back in the seventies and eighties it is in the court records i was incarcerated for nine months for taking responsibility for a box of glass water pipes that was shipped across state lines
4826602 cheech and i met with the heads of columbia pictures to pitch our next two films when we met outside the columbia offices cheech asked me what stories we were going to tell them i told cheech that i had a few plot lines i was working on wed have to just improvise
4826603 cheech was wearing the suit he wore in nash bridges
4826604 and was very straight and dry in answering the questions this was
4826605 no not at all im not tired of talking period
4826606 when you get to my age man you look for people to talk to
4826607 i never worried about it when i was in jail because i didnt do anything wrong
4826608 theyre the ones who have to suffer the karma and its coming down on them im just laughing at it
4826609 some of my biggest heroes in the entertainment business smoke pot im in good company
4826610 there was a big ego problem and then cheech grew up
4826611 before that i was like the boss and cheech came into his own and wanted to drive the bus the only problem was my bus goes one way and theres one driver
4826612 i love victoria i just love the old people there
4826613 people say you go to victoria to die but those f ers there they dont die they just hobble around forever man
4826614 is ill and should be cared for the way any human should and prison isnt the ideal place for that
4826615 a measure of clemency be considered for her as soon as possible
4826616 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4826617 we by no means are trying to film the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film series as soon possible
4826618 everything you do in life is futile but it is very important that you do them
4826619 no one will dare to call you plain when im through with you
4826620 i would like to meet a guy with dimples a cute smile wit sarcasm pretty eyes passionate funny just as dorky as i am and who will love me for me and not for what he thinks i could become is that too much to ask
4826621 rase una vez un p jaro adornado con un par de alas perfectas y plumas relucientes coloridas y maravillosas
4826622 ronnie drew was an iconic figure in irish music over the last five decades
4826623 i met him and admired his music his unique singing voice was loved by so many people ronnie whether as part of the dubliners or during his solo career will also be remembered for his promotion of irish music both at home and around the world he bore his illness with bravery and will be sadly missed
4826624 when you mention dublin you mention ronnie drew the two just went together
4826625 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshed our unique musical heritage

4826629 the pursuit of freedom as defined in an age of consumerism has induced a condition of dependence on imported goods on imported oil and on credit the chief desire of the american people
4826630 is that nothing should disrupt their access to these goods that oil and that credit the chief aim of the u s government is to satisfy that desire which it does in part of through the distribution of largesse here at home and in part through the pursuit of imperial ambitions abroad
4826631 the fundamental problem facing the country will remain stubbornly in place no matter who is elected in november
4826632 whats the fundamental problem you say is not going away no matter whether its mccain or obama
4826633 what will not go away is a yawning disparity between what americans expect and what theyre willing or able to pay
4826634 yawning disparity between what americans expect and what theyre willing to pay
4826635 seven years into its confrontation with radical islam the united states finds itself with too much war for too few warriors and with no prospect of producing the additional soldiers needed to close the gap
4826636 when i hear all this talk about increasing the troops in afghanistan from two to three battalions maybe even more i keep asking myself where are we going to get those troops
4826637 u s troops in battle dress and body armor whom americans profess to admire and support pay the price for the nations refusal to confront our domestic dysfunction
4826638 have been engaged in a de facto ponzi scheme intended to extend indefinitely the american line of credit
4826639 how are we gonna pay the bills how are we gonna pay for the commitment of entitlements that is going to increase year by year for the next couple of decades especially as baby boomers retire
4826640 it occurred between 1965 when president lyndon baines johnson ordered u s combat troops to south vietnam and 1973 when president richard nixon finally ended direct u s involvement in that war
4826641 doom sayers gloom sayers dont listen to them the countrys best days are ahead of us
4826642 modern prophet of profligacy the politician who gave moral sanction to the empire of consumption
4826643 the actual system of government conceived by the framers no longer pertains
4826644 we are going to need half a million men if we go into iraq
4826645 requires giving up on the illusions of grandeur to which the end of the cold war and then 9 11 gave rise it also means reining in the imperial presidents who expect the army to make good on those illusions
4826646 do you expect either john mccain or barack obama to rein in the
4826647 the occupant of the white house has become a combination of demigod father figure and inevitably the betrayer of inflated hopes pope pop star scold scapegoat crisis manager commander in chief agenda settler moral philosopher interpreter of the nations charisma object of veneration and the butt of jokes all rolled into one
4826648 the united states has become a de facto one party state with the legislative branch permanently controlled by an incumbents party and every president exploiting his role as commander in chief to expand on the imperial prerogatives of his office
4826649 elect us give us power in the congress and we will end the iraq war
4826650 anyone with a conscience sending soldiers back to iraq or afghanistan for multiple combat tours while the rest of the country chills out can hardly be seen as an acceptable arrangement it is unfair unjust and morally corrosive
4826651 ironically iraq may yet prove to be the source of our salvation
4826652 we had a beautiful horizon and now all we see is turbines
4826653 i seriously dont know what it takes to make the envionazis happy do you
4826654 we already know that under civil partnership the children of lesbian and gay mums and dads will be left in limbo with no constitutional or legal recognition or protection therefore civil partnership from the outset is not marriage like it is separate and it reinforces inequality
4826655 these are not folks who just met each other last week and said lets get married these are folks who have been together in some cases for decades
4826656 this decision is of an importance comparable to universal suffrage and our law on parity
4826657 we are now creating a system where the father is reduced to a sperm sample
4826658 parliament has no mandate to change the laws of nature
4826659 equal treatment is a fundamental right that all members of our society should enjoy
4826660 the fact that lesbians gays bisexuals and transsexuals are not treated equally in some aspects of eu legislation particularly concerning same sex couples should be a cause of concern for us all more comprehensive legal protection as well as wider powers and resources for equality bodies are required and i urge that the new measures on non discrimination discussed by the eu will ensure this
4826661 if it has to happen again well keep doing it until everyone gets it right we are as normal as everyone else and have the same rights
4826662 finally were able to do something and have it publicly recognized
4826663 this is incredible i thought it would be anticlimactic after 40 years but it isnt
4826664 stronger bond and a stronger commitment theres nothing that can break us apart
4826665 its like weve been at the back of the bus and were moving to the front
4826666 today means the world to be able to find my soulmate and be able to marry her is a dream
4826667 we just wanted to get in and do this before the opportunity goes
4826668 i see before me people who personify love and commitment
4826669 its something to just pray about its not a time to be joyful
4826670 the major media would love to see us engage in fierce protests and hostile demonstrations of outrage against the licensing of same sex marriages
4826671 our battle is not against the same sex couples who are pursuing the opportunity to marry granted them by the activist judges on the california supreme court
4826672 theres a window and we want to take advantage of that window because who knows whats going to happen in november
4826673 they have the right to protest but we have the right to marry god loves everybody
4826674 this is the most meaningful day of my life ive always wanted to get married
4826675 eventually and i think sooner than later i think a case is going to reach the u s supreme court and that will be the big bell rung one way or the other
4826676 californias domestic partner law already affords same sex couples every legal right that the state can grant and our measure does not change that one bit
4826677 our battle is not against the same sex couples who are pursuing the opportunity to marry granted them by the activist judges on the california supreme court our battle is against the flawed reasoning of the courts decision and is being waged to reaffirm the traditional definition of marriage
4826678 i think the most important point is that people understand a majority of people believed in the interracial ban
4826679 we all believe when the california supreme court struck down the law that it was the right step and i think were going to see the same thing
4826680 i think its really going to start changing peoples minds
4826681 the california court basically said the legislature has given gay couples all of the rights married people have except the right to call the relationship a marriage
4826682 all californians have a stake in living in a state that treats all people fairly and that does not let the government tell people who to marry
4826683 this is not just about gay people this is about everyones right to fair treatment and freedom

4826713 i think its going to be very competitive says espnu play by play announcer charlie neal who has broadcast meac games for more than a quarter century
4826714 this could possibly be the most competitive season ever in the meac there are five or six teams that can hang right in there until the end
4826715 the word parity is very accurate to use he says
4826716 everybody is putting more into it south carolina state coach buddy pough says theyve got a better idea what a winning football program can do for your school
4826717 it was a terrific effort from the boys and i was really pleased that we didnt let our heads drop after the defeat to the army
4826718 we knew it would be a tough opening match and if you look at the armys record this summer eight tournament wins out of eight then it gives you an idea of how goood a 7s side they are
4826719 theres no doubt that playing regularly competitive 7s is important and had we not played them first up and had a chance to get a game under our belts it could have been a different result
4826720 it may not have been the trophy we came here to win but its a first piece of silverware of the season and seeing the scenes in the dressing room after the match its a real confidence boost for these guys and that will rub off on the rest of the squad
4826721 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
4826722 i saw the finish on the big screen after the race and then i saw it slowed down frame by frame at the massage area
4826723 i was looking at the computer and its almost too close to see one one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport its pretty cool
4826724 it would be good for the sport if he lost
4826725 im sure people will be bringing this up for years saying that you know you won that race
4826726 is michael phelps the gold medal winner i think if we had to do this again id win
4826727 if anybody wants to say anything ill always welcome it i like it it definitely motivates me even more
4826728 both of us have metallic goggles so i couldnt see his eyes and he couldnt see mine
4826729 i really thought that cost me the race but it happened to be the direct opposite
4826730 if i would have glided i would have ended up being way too long i ended up making the right decision trying to just take sort of a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first it turned out to be in my favor
4826731 it seems like every day im in sort of a dream world
4826732 sometimes you sort of have to pinch yourself to see if its really real im just happy im in the real world
4826733 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4826734 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4826735 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4826736 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4826737 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4826738 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4826739 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4826740 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4826741 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4826742 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4826743 you look great this is your best haircut ive told you that before too
4826744 whats it like having full capacity control without my intervention

4826861 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4826862 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4826868 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

4826887 slashing funds for cultural activities both domestic and abroad is damaging to the fabric of our country and further jeopardizes canadas international reputation
4826888 this move appears to be more about extending the governments long tentacles of control into the area of cultural expression but this move will backfire on canada mr harper is slashing the arts in cynical attempt to win votes from a base he mis reads most canadians want to support a vibrant arts community
4826889 whats being considered is to examine how we can create a new program or new avenues that will be more efficient and with a stronger impact for our culture abroad
4826890 the opposition seems to be accusing us of having an agenda to see that the arts is funded to a lesser extent on an ideological basis and i can say thats not the case because we are spending more on the arts than the liberal government
4826891 these cuts are shocking and short sighted and they certainly arent business friendly
4826892 support for arts and culture are among the most efficient investments a government can make

4826899 look over walls or into compounds in afghanistan will prove a real asset to the troops the only problem so far is figuring out a way to minimize noise because really what good is a spy when everyone can hear it coming thats some
4826900 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
4826901 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that has such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
4826902 the club has enjoyed great success in recent years winning titles and cups in
4826903 he is being brought to gujarat soon we are confident that after interrogating him we will get more information related to the blasts
4826904 we have uncovered this network and it will help in solving the cases of other offensives across the country
4826905 we have some hints but the media needs to bear with us
4826906 well think about it ive been working you like a dog and whens the last time you had a vacation that wasnt for healing from surgery
4826907 be good to myself be good to myself be good to myself
4826908 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4826909 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4826910 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4826911 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4826912 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4826913 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4826914 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4826915 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4826916 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4826917 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4826918 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4826919 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4826920 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4826921 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4826922 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4826923 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4826924 i will drop dead right here on the floor if that doesnt receive the highest score yet

4826936 john has been your rock and now hes having his own existential crisis
4826937 who told you that youre allowed to throw things away i may move out but its not your apartment
4826938 well you only have two months before she moves out
4826939 i think itll be longer than that i mean shell start spending more time at barrys gradually but it wont be right away
4826940 when that happens and this is just a suggestion for your own well being but you should really set some boundaries as soon as she moves let her know that she needs to call you and let you know shell be coming over
4826941 i wonder if shes going to be invasive and show up at your door whenever she wants
4826942 well that one time when i told her to get off my case and she got so angry that i hid behind the table
4826943 lets get into this fear more lets do a role play
4826944 okay lets back up and see where that would happen
4826945 lets switch roles now you be you and ill be mom
4826946 i was scared into doing it but after taking a few seconds to gather myself i did it
4826947 you know mom when you give me the silent treatment youre trying to hurt me
4826948 it overpowers me i become small and feel like i have no choice no power
4826949 can you draw that draw what it feels like when your mom gets angry with you
4826950 i feel bad i dont think my mom is all bad
4826951 well of course not did you think i thought you believe that she has many good parts and you love those parts but she has this angry side of her that you fear and its real and legitimate for you to feel this way about her
4826952 i have no doubt your mother has this side of her and you are now living a memory of it
4826953 youve had a lot of strength this week dont forget that
4826954 take the money and go wait by the door maybe go to the elevator open the door already see what the total is and if its under 14 leave a dollar off
4826955 its so scary to need someone like that without feeling like you have to pay them back for it
4826956 thats a beautiful skirt youre wearing but that top doesnt match and you need to lose some weight
4826957 gosh sorry here i am again with my stupid misery nothing new here no reason to worry im just needy dont take it seriously
4826958 oh my god i wish i could die right now
4826959 this year some kids were able to express things for the first time
4826960 theres also a population of people who have been very active in 9 11 recovery that know that this is very real
4826961 many donors in terms of mental health services begin to ask the question whether the trauma is really related to 9 11 anymore or not
4826962 i think many donors feel a sense of responsibility to make a one time response to this kind of disaster but rarely an ongoing one
4826963 its like an onion peel to get people to understand that these kids are still at risk
4826964 its a culture that doesnt orient people to seeking help responders are supposed to be tough
4826965 i know exactly what youre going through and im right there with you im aware of where you are emotionally 24 7 i know exactly what to do if youre not okay its
4826966 but ironically susan cant take care of me unless she knows im not well
4826967 and im afraid of what will happen when im the more i become aware of how angry this makes me the more unbearable it will be to live together
4826968 yes you are having a hard time and your needing is fine
4826969 im going to go find my boss because i kind of need to know what to do
4826970 i have to work all day from 1 to 9
4826971 this weekend i became aware of how much i want to be taken care of
4826972 i really encourage you to just give into all of it you know you really want to youve wanted to since day one
4826973 i want to tell you something but just so you know im aware that this is an infantile wish and im really not asking you for anything
4826974 well i dont really mean that its just the child in me
4826975 so you censored how you felt from her so in the picture you actually drew how you have so much to say that its all getting stuck in your throat
4826976 do you know how blessed you are to be able to remember this so many people struggle to remember things like these and you are very deeply in touch with it
4826977 you know i keep emailing you to check if youre still there
4826978 you know im fine with you emailing me i know weekends are difficult and if you need contact with me im fine with you emailing me over the weekends
4826979 why is it that you have this need to punish yourself this way its like im giving you a box of chocolates im telling you that you can have what you want from me and you wont take it
4826980 try not to torture yourself too much when you get home
4826981 you know you come here you email me you get what you really need and then you torture yourself
4826982 well if youre doing it there must be a good reason for it
4826983 you really needed to tell me something and just sort of told me that you needed me in an underhanded way
4826984 what i really wanted to say was that i really need you you are getting me through the week and though i feel ashamed for needing you this much i need you
4826985 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness
4826986 the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us
4826987 and i god said unto mine only begotten which was with me from the beginning let us make man in our image after our likeness
4826988 i the lord god said unto mine only begotten behold the man is become as one of us
4826989 all things that im hearing theyre going to make those kind of recommendations
4826990 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4826991 it competes with charles de gaulle paris it competes with dubai now and with schiphol amsterdam because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with competition i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up but i think the competition issue actually doesnt wash
4826992 the risk is too high there are too many potential consequences
4826993 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4826994 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4826995 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4826996 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4826997 oh ya hari ini kami merayakan ulang tahun pernikahan yang ketiga
4826998 get a short code to include into your blog and share it with the world
4826999 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4827004 we are very sorry to hear that a customer is unhappy with one of our high school musical products and apologise for any offence caused
4827005 the knickers in question were designed using our high school musical 2 artwork which uses the creative theme of a swimming pool as this is a key part of the films storyline
4827006 unfortunately a genuine oversight was made and the text on this product was used outside the context of the swimming pool

4827014 as the all blacks we want to congratulate new zealand swimmers who won gold in the swimming pool at the olympic games it was very motivational
4827015 the medals were an inspiration and showed a lot of courage and it was precisely that which won the game for us that togetherness as a team
4827016 we are proud of them and were just as proud of our rugby team who showed superb fitness in the final 20 minutes
4827017 we just stuck to our task and got into good positions to set up a good platform
4827018 it was a hell of a physical match and the defensive attitude of the guys really paid off in the end the way we gang tackled the boks and forced the turnovers we worked hard for them and that set the standard for the game we really targeted the start
4827019 they were at our line a couple of times and we also missed a few shots at goal but some days it is like that we really scrambled hard on defence and we knew we had to stop them defence sets the attitude for the game and those gang tackles slowed down their ball it was all about attitude

4827022 i speak to friends who tell me with zero insider info but total confidence that each episode is scripted
4827023 part of the skepticism of course stems from the fact that the hills violates a cardinal convention of reality tv it doesnt utilize the first person confessionals jimmy really got trashed at hooters last night etc that are a staple of the genre

4827026 god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds
4827027 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist
4827028 who was with god and who was god even in the beginning all things were made and without him was not anything made that was made
4827029 behold i am jesus christ the son of god i created the heavens and the earth and all things that in them are i was with the father from the beginning i am in the father and the father in me and in me hath the father glorified his name
4827030 behold i say unto you that the law is fulfilled that was given unto moses behold i am he that gave the law and i am he who covenanted with my people israel therefore the law in me is fulfilled for i have come to fulfil the law therefore it hath an end
4827031 hearken o ye people of my church to whom the kingdom has been given hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof and by whom all things were made which live and move and have a being
4827032 behold i am jesus christ the son of the living god who created the heavens and the earth a light which cannot be hid in darkness

4827034 and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many
4827035 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation
4827036 and then shall the heathen nations be redeemed and they that knew no law shall have part in the first resurrection
4827037 for as death hath passed upon all men to fulfil the merciful plan of the great creator there must needs be a power of resurrection and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall and the fall came by reason of transgression and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the lord wherefore it must needs be an infinite atonement save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption wherefore the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration and if so this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth to rise no more o the wisdom of god his mercy and grace for behold if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the eternal god and became the devil to rise no more and our spirits must have become like unto him and we become devils angels to a devil to be shut out from the presence of our god and to remain with the father of lies in misery like unto himself yea to that being who beguiled our first parents who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness o how great the goodness of our god who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster yea that monster death and hell which i call the death of the body and also the death of the spirit and because of the way of deliverance of our god the holy one of israel this death of which i have spoken which is the temporal shall deliver up its dead which death is the grave and this death of which i have spoken which is the spiritual death shall deliver up its dead which spiritual death is hell wherefore death and hell must deliver up their dead and hell must deliver up its captive spirits and the grave must deliver up its captive bodies and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored one to the other and it is by the power of the resurrection of the holy one of israel o how great the plan of our god for on the other hand the paradise of god must deliver up the spirits of the righteous and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again and all men become incorruptible and immortal and they are living souls having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect

4827041 will render to every man according to his deeds to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality eternal life but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil
4827042 to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man
4827043 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4827044 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4827045 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4827046 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4827047 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4827048 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4827049 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4827050 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4827051 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4827052 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4827053 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4827054 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4827055 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4827056 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4827057 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4827058 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4827059 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4827060 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4827061 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4827062 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4827063 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4827064 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4827065 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4827066 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4827067 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4827068 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4827069 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4827070 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4827071 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4827072 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4827073 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4827074 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4827075 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4827076 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4827077 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4827078 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4827079 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4827080 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4827081 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4827082 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4827083 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4827084 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4827085 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4827098 the sole purpose of any play should be to change the entire world thats it
4827099 because if everyone in the world sees your play and understands it then everything in the world should change you shouldnt shoot for anything less than that
4827100 the political comedy that works best is a direct challenge to the audience in some way
4827101 nobody likes to see some jerk stand on a stage and scream
4827102 what i want to see is an audience that is so outraged you have no choice but to laugh about it and then go out and make the world a better place
4827103 a lot of political theater actually ends up being vaudeville
4827104 if you put george bush on stage and threw a pie at him thats vaudeville an old and respected tradition of theater but its not a play when you start pretending it is a play you should be compared to clifford odetts and bertolt brecht when really here you should be compared to w c fields
4827105 we do plays and no matter what the circumstances any play has to have a dramatic arc
4827106 you still have to be dramatically engaging and tell a coherent interesting story
4827107 i dont pay much attention to corporate media now but i am sure by now i would have heard if john mccain had renounced the bush policy in iraq
4827108 thats everything i need to know about st paul its easier for me to be loving and forgiving from afar
4827109 to avoid having to take innocent lives in exchange for corporate gain
4827110 this bush mccain policy in iraq is dangerous to my nation and as a patriot and as a marine i cannot support it
4827111 if somebody came to my play and absolutely disagreed with me to the extent that they then went out and started to lend active support to some pro war iraq veterans i would feel like i had achieved my purpose even more so than if somebody came in who was opposed to the war and said yep he was right and then did nothing
4827112 good theater gets people off their couches and if theres anything we need in america right now its to get people away from the tv and doing something about what they believe in whatever that is
4827113 when you think about it the odd couple is about two guys who grew
4827114 that play was one of the key influences in the huge expansion of the abolitionist movement and moving the country toward the emancipation proclamation and the civil war
4827115 theres nothing funny about the subject or the victims because its too horrific
4827116 but part of it always should be about the audience uncomfortably laughing at themselves because if you agree that all of this is horribly wrong shouldnt you be out in the streets doing something about it
4827117 queremos ouvir quais as propostas e projetos destes produtores para a nossa terra eles devem nos dar explica es sobre as inten es deles em nosso estado caso os produtores do mato grosso n o queiram negociar vamos impedir que cheguem capital
4827118 if you were stranded on a desert island what would you eat
4827119 russia needs to withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4827120 georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations theres no room for debate on this matter
4827121 there is no doubt that russia right now today is an occupying power in georgia
4827122 their real goal here is to overthrow president mikheil saakashvili
4827123 the russians changed the rules of the game they invaded a neighboring country for the first time since the soviet union
4827124 this kind of war cannot belong to the 21st century
4827125 when you drive to tbilisi you see russians the whole way
4827126 i still cannot believe a foreign army is staying here
4827127 con las mismas personas y las mismas pol ticas los gobiernos socialistas han llevado a la crisis a nuestro pa s en la primera mitad de los a os 90 y ahora de nuevo bajo el mandato de zapatero
4827128 a nadie se le ocurre poner bombas por estar en contra de un proyecto
4827129 this is the countrys contribution to the global efforts against climate change
4827130 today firewood in the north is an intensive commercial activity it is a major source of employment for the people and if it is to be stopped an alternative source of employment must be sought
4827131 during this period we just have to pitch mosquito nets on the verandas and sleep outside our rooms throughout
4827132 for 9 or 10 years now the river beds have been empty these are streams which at one point were permanent but today you can find water in them only at the peak of the rainy season
4827133 in the final analysis the only way to salvage the situation is to plant trees to stop the encroaching desert but we should not plant just any trees they should be fast growing multi purpose trees
4827134 bipartisan effort will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards
4827135 raising taxes will ultimately hurt consumers by forcing them to pay even higher gas prices and republicans will oppose them
4827136 largely more of the same failed proposals theyve been trotting out for months
4827137 designed to give political cover to vulnerable democrats who are losing ground
4827138 the democratic leadership should bring up a clean bill give the members a chance to vote up or down on whether or not we should proceed with offshore drilling and not insert any legislative poison pills
4827139 those would be provisions that they know will never be enacted and are added only for the purpose of killing the effort to open up the outer continental shelf to drilling
4827140 rehashes washed up garbage that didnt have the ability to pass this house and theyre going to try to couple that with limited offshore production
4827141 el sistema dice esto yo siempre he o do que no puede haber un error en el sistema de cronometraje lo nico que puedo decir es que fue una carrera dura y que nad lo mejor que pude

4827147 moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you
4827148 the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob
4827149 verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am
4827150 and it came to pass that the lord spake unto them saying arise and come forth unto me that ye may thrust your hands into my side and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet that ye may know that i am the god of israel and the god of the whole earth and have been slain for the sins of the world
4827151 for a father of many nations have i made thee
4827152 thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed

4827155 lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of the people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel
4827156 behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword may pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
4827157 fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is
4827158 there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men
4827159 yea and the voice of the lord by the mouth of the angels doth declare it unto all nations
4827160 yea doth declare it that they might have glad tidings of great joy yea and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people yea even to them that are scattered abroad unto the face of the earth wherefore they have come unto us
4827161 made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child
4827162 he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name
4827163 that i beheld that after she had been carried away in the spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me saying look and i looked and beheld the virgin again bearing a child in her arms and the angel said unto me behold the lamb of god yea even the son of the eternal father
4827164 he shall be born of mary at jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers she being a virgin a precious and chosen vessel who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the holy ghost and bring forth a son yea even the son of god
4827165 i seek refuge from thee to allah most gracious come not near if thou dost fear allah
4827166 nay i am only a messenger from thy lord to announce to thee the gift of a pure son
4827167 how shall i have a son seeing that no man has touched me and i am not unchaste
4827168 so it will be thy lord saith that is easy for me and we wish to appoint him as a sign unto men and a mercy from us it is a matter so decreed
4827169 ah would that i had died before this would that i had been a thing forgotten
4827170 grieve not for thy lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee
4827171 and shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm tree it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee
4827172 o sister of aaron thy father was not a man of evil nor thy mother a woman unchaste
4827173 how can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle
4827174 i am indeed a servant of allah he hath given me revelation and made me a prophet
4827175 and he hath made me blessed wheresoever i be and hath enjoined on me prayer and charity as long as i live
4827176 he hath made me kind to my mother and not overbearing or unblest
4827177 so peace is on me the day i was born the day that i die and the day that i shall be raised up to life again

4827179 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4827180 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4827181 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4827182 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4827183 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4827184 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4827185 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4827186 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4827187 who are open to doing something on the production side
4827188 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4827189 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4827190 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4827191 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4827192 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4827193 conventional business wisdom tells us that there is always something to learn from failure not true sometimes it just stinks
4827194 in failure give up the shame grieve failures and wallow if you need to but let go rather than absorb shame and deflect shame coming at you from others find new words to define a poor outcome
4827195 failure gives a choice it provides an escape hatch to find a different choice
4827196 more effective risk taking improve your decision making by examining the risks take only the risks that you want and avoide the ones that could prove fatal
4827197 process trumps outcome we are too focused on the binary outcome success or failure business is all about cycles and we need to focus on the process more than the outcome for better decision making that will improve our chance of success
4827198 a measurement system of our own money doesnt buy happiness with what besides money will you measure your success
4827199 value action stop reading this book and see what comes next
4827200 thats exactly what its like but ive never seen it verbalized in quite this way
4827201 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4827202 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
4827203 it will be a beautiful day when the masses look at the paper and truly realize they have lost their own country
4827204 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people

4827215 france hasnt any oil but she knew how to exploit a rich idea in the whirlwind of globalization civil nuclear power became a weapon commercial and political that allowed the country to remain at the avant garde in the concert of nations
4827216 a lot of countries realize that with the rising price of fossil fuels and energy and the climate emergency nuclear can be part of the solution
4827217 this way nuclear energy can bring a lot its co2 free energy
4827218 replaces a gas powered electricity plant saves two billion cubic meters of gas each year and each e p r replacing a coal plant means cutting 11 million tons of co2
4827219 our system of security is extremely responsive and transparent and that the media and public opinion needed a training period to understand how the system of nuclear security works in france

4827263 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4827264 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4827265 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4827266 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4827267 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4827268 one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport
4827269 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4827270 theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4827271 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4827272 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4827273 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4827274 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4827275 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done
4827276 i knew michael is a back half swimmer and that he would be chasing me down at the end
4827277 i saw his shadow on the side of my goggle and i knew he was coming i liked to be chased the last eight meters i just put my head down and i did not breathe
4827278 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4827279 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4827280 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4827281 i am sure bob bowman his coach and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4827282 people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race
4827283 if we got to do this again i would win it
4827284 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4827285 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4827286 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4827287 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4827288 they accepted the ruling because it was not the human eye making the judgment
4827289 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4827290 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4827291 technology is also imperfect the hand is quicker than the eye
4827292 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4827293 there is no doubt the question was for him to share or not to share first place there is no doubt the first arrival was michael phelps
4827294 in the old days the judges ruled now its the timers

4827310 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4827311 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry

4827322 there are questions raised because the beach is a public place and there are questions about whether a beach is an appropriate place to have a camera
4827323 you could read this law to say that such behavior is illegal and it sets itself up for a possible constitutional attack
4827324 the issue becomes whether you can have an expectation of privacy when you are swimming nude at a public place

4827370 we demand the upa government that they bring in reservation for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in all private educational institutes in the country
4827371 it is unfortunate that the supreme court has exempted higher educational private institutions from implementing quota
4827372 it is necessary for us to ensure that there is a common united struggle of all the oppressed sections in the society to bring in a change in the societal structure
4827373 we have burnt our hands once with the independents and there is no chance of our party siding with the jmm we prefer to go for polls rather than experimenting with new formations
4827374 there is no point experimenting the party would demand an early poll and a fresh mandate last time too it was a mandate in favour of bjp and even today the people jharkhand want the bjp government to return to power with a thumping majority
4827375 the facts are otherwise and government has been assiduously pursuing the matter as would be seen from the position brought out earlier and has in fact suggested further cross loc confidence building measures which will continue to be pursued with pakistan
4827376 the political future of president musharraf is a matter to be decided by the pakistani people through normal constitutional channels washington should not do anything that appearing as thwarting their will

4827381 we have been requesting him to go and he should also demonstrate maturity and leave
4827382 there are two schools of thought one school says that in a battlefield you always leave the room for exit so that you lose the least and the opposition has a chance to retreat
4827383 and the other school is that let him confront and let parliament do what other parliaments have done to the dictators of the world
4827384 from a position where people would defend him musharraf and ask why should he go everybody is asking today why isnt he going that was done by design we have managed to bring it to this position
4827385 has no political position and thats enshrined in our constitution
4827386 as far as the players go there has been some concern there is no doubt about that there has been concern for quite a while now

4827448 a drop of 30 a barrel helps but traffic is collapsing so airlines are having to discount like crazy to fill their planes
4827449 people are hesitant to spend money and the concept of taking a trip on an airliner these days is not appealing particularly with all the new fees and service cuts
4827450 i didnt expect any fare sales so it was surprising
4827451 its a pretty telling sign that we are close to a tipping point
4827452 for every action there is an equal or opposite reaction
4827453 not involving in politics will face its punishment you will be ruled by those who are worse than you or by useless
4827454 the aim of the politics is to seek for righteousness

4827456 voi nu sinteti marturisitori ai dreptei credinte caci nu aveti harul sfintului duh in biserica voastra noi insa fiind dreptcredinciosi avem puterea cea adevarata a harului sfintului duh pe care si cu fapta sintem gata intotdeauna s o aratam cu ajutorul lui dumnezeu
4827457 nu nu prin dispute ci cu fapta vreau s o dovediti altfel va voi arata eu intru incredintarea tuturor
4827458 cum sa aratam caci nu e cu putinta sa dovedim decit cu cuvintul sfintelor scripturi
4827459 in dispute este osteneala fara de capat dar noi fara infruntari de vorbe putem usor sa dovedim cu ajutorul lui dumnezeu haideti zice in mijlocul orasului si acolo sa ni se aduca apa curata iar arhiereul meu si preotii sai o vor sfinti in vazul tuturor tot asa vor face si ai vostri deosebit si sfintind o o vom pune in biserica voastra cea mare in vase osebite pe care le vom astupa si le vom pecetlui cu pecetile noastre pecetluind si usa bisericii pentru 40 de zile si a cui apa va ramine nestricata ca si cum de abia ar fi fost scoasa din izvor credinta aceluia este dreapta iar daca apa cuiva se va strica credinta lui este rea daca apa mea va ramine nestricata cum nadajduiesc ca ma va ajuta dumnezeu voi n o sa va mai impotriviti si o sa mi ingaduiti sa zidesc biserica iar daca nu faca se voia voastra n am s o zidesc
4827460 doamne cheama i pe latini si pe preotii lor si nu astepta ziua a patruzecea cea hotarita sa mergem la biserica si desf cind pecetile sa deschidem usile vei vedea harul lui dumnezeu iar robii lui care si pun cu adevarat nadejdea in el nu se vor face de rusine
4827461 doamne dumnezeule unul in sfinta treime slavit si preamarit precum inainte vreme pe dreptul tau ilie l ai auzit vestind cu foc adevarul tau si i ai rusinat pe cei de rea credinta auzi ma acum si pe mine robul tau nevrednic dimpreuna cu toti robii tai de aici nu pentru vrednicia noastra pe care n o avem ci pentru slavirea numelui tau sfint si pentru intarirea credintei noastre care este adevarata credinta in tine arata intreg harul sfintului duh in apa aceasta ca prin nestricaciunea ei sa vada toti ca numai in biserica ta greceasca si soborniceasca de la rasarit se afla credinta cea adevarata si harul cel adevarat al sfintului duh caci tu esti singurul care pe toate le binecuvintezi si le sfintesti dumnezeul nostru si slava tie iti inaltam tatalui si fiului si sfintului duh acum si pururi si in vecii vecilor amin
4827462 doamne lumina mea si mintuitorul meu de cine sa ma tem
4827463 slava tie dumnezeul nostru care ti ai plecat urechea la rugaciunile noastre slava tie care proslavesti biserica ta slava tie care intaresti cu slava credinta cea dreapta si nu ne ai facut de rusine in asteptarile noastre
4827464 veniti sa vedeti cum a stat aceasta apa atitea zile raminind nestricata datorita harului sfintului duh si incredintati va ca adevarata este credinta noastra ortodoxa
4827465 adevarata este credinta greceasca pe care o tine domnitorul sa si zideasca deci biserica in orasul nostru caci fiindca nu i am ingaduit dumnezeu s a miniat pe noi si ne a imputit apa
4827466 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4827467 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4827468 issues like russia are new so they give the media and the political observers something to talk about
4827469 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4827470 we shall match your capacity to inflict suffering by our capacity to endure suffering we shall meet your physical force with soul force do to us what you will and we shall continue to love you we cannot in all good conscience obey your unjust laws because noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good throw us in jail and we shall still love you bomb our homes and threaten our children and we shall still love you send your hooded perpetrators of violence into our community at the midnight hour and beat us and leave us half dead and we shall still love you but be ye assured that we will wear you down by our capacity to suffer one day we shall win freedom but not only for ourselves we shall so appeal to your heart and conscience that we shall win you in the process and our victory will be a double victory
4827471 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4827472 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4827473 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4827474 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict
4827475 what peacekeepers from what countries are needed for the people of south ossetia to feel comfortable is a primarily up to the people of south ossetia
4827476 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today

4827499 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4827500 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4827501 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4827502 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4827503 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4827504 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4827505 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4827506 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4827507 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4827508 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4827509 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4827510 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4827511 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4827512 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4827513 under orders should be in every rucksack for those moments when soldiers need spiritual energy
4827514 in no way reflects the policy or opinion of the united states military or department of defense
4827515 in no way reflects the policy or opinion of the united states military
4827516 recognizes cgsc faculty for published writing contributions that enhance the mission of the college
4827517 the us army command and general staff college educates and develops leaders for full spectrum joint interagency and multinational operations acts as lead agent for the armys leader development program and advances the art and science of the profession of arms in support of army operational requirements
4827518 belief in god is a foundational factor once you do away with god as a given truth all other things are immediately affected by that for instance once god does not exist you suddenly have no reference to greatness outside of yourself and no revelation outside of yourself the greatest thing in life suddenly becomes something or someone else like yourself perhaps
4827519 strikes deep into the power of sin and renders it ineffective
4827520 only my goodnatured ness can help me contribute to the betterment of my unit or team when i realize that sin is an agent i can more quickly identify my own tendency to corrupt a group and bring havoc to what needs cohesion and team confidence my sin can also make my agenda more important than my units agenda and thus lead to unit failure
4827521 ive seen individuals from all economic levels and situations fail to get situated philosophically and religiously ending up wandering in institutions like our military just when you need that inner source of clarity and direction it fails to surface and when you could have made a difference for your team you fail
4827522 i was told because i cant put my personal beliefs aside and pray with troops i wouldnt make a good leader
4827523 look there is simply no other way to say it but to speak the absolute brutal truth here general petraeus has shockingly abrogated and noxiously defiled the sacred oath he took to protect and preserve support and defend not a parochial biblical worldview of the new testaments gospel of jesus christ but the united states constitution which includes a specific beacon provision which boldly proclaims absolutely no religious test in clause 3 article 6 by so very prominently and universally endorsing chaplain mccoys book with its unadulterated promotion of christian religious supremacy and concomitant excoriating and denigrating of the veracity integrity and character of the hundreds of thousands of united states military personnel who freely elect to follow no religious path petraeus unlawfully fashions his own de facto religion test in direct contravention of americas most cherished and beloved governing document his command leadership role thus has become terminally freighted and compromised with this disgusting vile unconstitutional christian religious tyranny and exceptionalism at precisely the same time we are at war with islamic fundamentalists framing americas iraq and afghanistan combat efforts as a modern day crusade the monumentally detrimental national security risks attendant to petraeuss actions of constitutional defiance justify the swift forfeiture of his titular position of military command and further cry out for his immediate punishment by general courts martial under article 134
4827524 under the rubric of free speech and the twisted idea of the separation of church and state there has evolved more and more an anti christian bias in this country
4827525 being christian should bring goodness to our culture but the way it is being censored in our society you would think that to be a christian is to be a wicked torturous warmonger who wields religion over the heads and hearts of local governments to establish more wicked rules of right and wrong for everyone to obey without question where is this wickedness since when did christian become evil
4827526 i will not proselytize from other religious bodies but i retain the right to evangelize those who are not affiliated

4827578 if the super delegates are looking at electability these results could be a shot in the arm for sen clinton no one has won the white house since 1960 without carrying two of these three swing states florida ohio and pennsylvania and she clearly is running much better against sen mccain than is sen obama at least for now
4827579 although there is such infighting now between the two democratic candidates we are finding that both democrats are beating mccain and this could be attributed to the weakening of the economy
4827580 the right direction wrong track question sets the stage for the pessimistic and gloomy view about the economy
4827581 the last time we had wrong track in the 70 range was back in 1992
4827582 this is an issue that mccain really has to work on to turn peoples attitudes around
4827583 this is an issue that is a positive for democrats and that may explain why they are doing better even though they are still fighting each other and mccain is getting a free ride

4827597 the people who were close to him pleaded with him not to do it
4827598 we knew what the questions were gonna be but it really was the antics the looks the dismissive tone the strut it was being flippant some say being pompous and arrogant

4827609 when clinton is simply doing what everyone else has always done shes constantly attacked as an obsessed and crazed egomaniac bent on self aggrandizement at the expense of her party
4827610 beseeching her to get the hell out of the race

4827640 if it doesnt get much more dramatic quickly i will extricate myself from the process
4827641 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
4827642 when the vehicle was stopped the soldiers fearing an attack arbitrarily fired on it
4827643 the plan is to ensure that security is improved to allow residents of the district operate without fear of being attacked by members of the armed militia still on the run
4827644 we are yet to make any arrest connected to the financing of the militia but the investigations are still going on
4827645 what i am aiming at is to advance to the final i will not spend so much energy in qualifying so that i remain fresh when it matters
4827646 talented and a fighter who will advance to the next round
4827647 my coach had said it would be good for me if i lost when he said that i was fired up
4827648 i said im going to go for it and when i saw that finish i said wow
4827649 im quite happy with my performance if anybody ever told me that i would finish fifth in the final of the olympics i would have taken it as a big joke
4827650 i still have some time on my side and no one should write me off by the time the london olympics come round i will have hit my peak
4827651 we will discuss protection assistance and care of victims of forced displacement
4827652 uganda is a model in the whole continent and the summit would not only show case the country but it will also give us a chance to share our experiences with the rest of the countries
4827653 one wonders what has happened to the giant known as bp we have stopped bp from picking fuel because they are owing tazama huge sums of money
4827654 we have put pressure on bp to pay just like anybody else is doing in this sector bp enjoys a lot of presence on the market and have a big network and commands a lot of influence
4827655 i received a call from nairobi to the effect that cheruiyots injury failed to heal in time and we are replacing him with kibet

4827660 when you are poor you use firewood engage in traditional agriculture that causes soil erosion and environmental degradation through over grazing
4827661 that is why the government is building dams in bujagali and others at karuma and hoima to get rid of using firewood and resort to electricity
4827662 we must also modernise agriculture to avoid degradation of the environment
4827663 western medical science has long dismissed african indigenous and by extension other indigenous medical theories as superstitious gibberish unworthy of serious consideration
4827664 it does not seem real and i will only believe after i see my payslip
4827665 we are spearheading the process of transforming kenya to a globally competitive and prosperous nation
4827666 we thank the government for looking into the plight of the lower cadres in the civil service by giving them a pay rise
4827667 the distribution of this salary adjustment takes into account the disparities within job groups and the need to motivate staff in the lower and middle class the increase also takes into account the governments ability to pay within the current budgetary constraints
4827668 the implementation is the final salary award in the civil service within the harmonisation framework whose first phase was implemented with effect from july 1 2005
4827669 without a teacher there can be no doctors engineers pilots and other professionals including our ministers so i urge the teachers unions not to fall in the trap of blackmail but continue with the work the late ambrose adongo left behind

4827676 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4827677 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4827678 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
4827679 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
4827680 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
4827681 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is

4827721 you were the chairman of the task force on epidemic control you were reported to have expressed satisfaction with the protocol before the trial begun and you participated in the trial in a supervisory role more importantly you were also the ministers representative in this capacity you were in the best position if you were in doubt to ensure that all the requirements were fulfilled before the commencement of the trial nigerian doctors including you supervised the management and treatment of the patients you started crying foul only when you relationship with pfizer soured when the company could not reportedly meet your personal demands
4827722 i state categorically that i never authorised the trail of trovofloxacin by pfizer during the epidemic of csm in neither did i take part in any capacity whatsoever as claimed by the minister of health therefore as the minsters representative i can state categorically that pfizer did not receive governments approval for the trial since by implication i held the power for such approval on behalf of the government of the federal republic of nigeria

4827724 it was illegal to borrow this money from bank of uganda
4827725 you have only 24 four hours to provide us with the parliamentary approval because as far as we are concerned this money was used behind our back
4827726 there is a lot of suspicion as regards this deal and as a committee we shall prove to you that this was a conduit to defraud public funds
4827727 we acquired this loan because it was inevitable at the time we didnt have funds yet the president had to execute his duties
4827728 we didnt go to bank of uganda we went to the ministry of finance and we dont owe anything to bank of uganda
4827729 we have tried our level best to attend the meetings of the joint committee and make our recommendations whenever it was necessary however to our disappointment the bill has become over politicised
4827730 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
4827731 the greatest problem faced by transgenders is finding accommodation since most of us are ostracised by our families we have nowhere to go
4827732 very few people are willing to give us houses on rent and we stay in groups of 10 to 12 which is very inconvenient
4827733 we have been fighting this for long we request the government to consider our demand

4827739 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4827740 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s

4827742 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4827743 i wasnt even sure i would take part in this olympics
4827744 but because it was in beijing i wanted to be here

4827753 india has been assiduously pursuing the matter of opening trade route across the loc and would continue to do so india is ready to commence cross loc trade but awaits pakistani willingness to implement the agreement reached in april 2005
4827754 we had emphasised to pakistan that they should not insist on procedural issues raised by them as that would tie up the whole issue in a morass of red tape and further delay the initiation of cross loc trade
4827755 in the process elements who have been opposed to normalisation of the situation in the sensitive state have also got an opportunity to misguide the people
4827756 it is hoped that the people of the valley will not allow themselves to get involved in activities which have disrupted the normalcy of the state the daily lives of the people including education of children supplies of basic commodities normal business and other activities including tourism which is one of the mainstays of the economy there
4827757 china felt much closer to home than the u s or europe it was an achievable destination for me
4827758 there were only 500 tickets available with the association for all of india and despite having filled out all the paper work i couldnt get any
4827759 i am just amazed by what a wonderful show china has put on
4827760 i mean we keep comparing china and india but after coming here i realise there is no comparison
4827761 its the discipline of the people they the chinese are so polite and so united in their efforts to demonstrate to the world what they can do
4827762 to be honest we felt quite left out of the games
4827763 apart from us there are hardly any indians at any of the events even the smaller countries have visible fans a voice but in the matches weve been to there is no one to cheer along with us
4827764 i gave it my best i got a good start i was unfortunate i started feeling tired towards the middle i am pretty upset
4827765 i was so emotional and happy we achieved what we came here to do
4827766 race walking is rather unpredictable fortunately i made it today it was difficult to fight people from ecuador and spain i had done a lot of preparations i have been training all alone
4827767 i feel lucky to have competed with three generations of russian race walkers i am really happy that i have been able to compete here after 12 years
4827768 i can get in the final at my first attempt it is great my goal is to break my world record i feel confident
4827769 india may defer a decision for several years however the political and military challenge posed by communist china will probably lead to an eventual indian decision to join the nuclear club
4827770 fears that it will eventually be overwhelmed by its more populous arab neighbours
4827771 sees a possibility that nuclear weapons may be required to defend the principle of neutrality
4827772 does not wish to lead a parade but might follow
4827773 escape clauses of treaty would prevent gop from being disadvantaged if it signed and goi did not and goi proceeded development nuclear weapons and means of delivery
4827774 has been perceived by india as a direct blow to its own prestige and political position and as a potential threat to its security
4827775 might be ready to test a nuclear weapons device in perhaps a years time
4827776 it is likely that india would feel compelled to seek missiles if they could not be procured india would have to undertake a prolonged development program for which its industrial base is not well suited
4827777 probably bring the issue of indias going nuclear to a head earlier than in the case of the other nuclear capable countries
4827778 although now lacking in the technical capabilities necessary for a nuclear weapons program pakistan would undoubtedly seek to acquire them a new pak alignment with communist china could result
4827779 to meet the political and security incentives that are at the root of the nuclear proliferation issue as it has arisen in india
4827780 recent discussion between the u s representative in geneva and his indian counterpart
4827781 the latter said explicitly that a non proliferation treaty would not be worth having if it focused on what he termed the hypothetical nth country problem rather than the real problem posed by communist chinas growing nuclear capability
4827782 military aid to strengthen indias defence against the communist chinese conventional threat
4827783 to make clear to india that she does not have to consider exploding a nuclear device to achieve recognition
4827784 collective alternatives to national deterrence involving a closer nuclear relationship with the u s
4827785 and is not likely to materialize before many years have passed if indeed it materializes at all
4827786 if the americans want to come to our aid against an attack by the chinese they will even if we dont sign the npt and if they dont want to come to our aid they wont even if we do sign the treaty
4827787 the need for such arrangements is the more urgent since an indian national nuclear program which may prove difficult to avoid could well have serious repercussions in two key allied countries germany and japan
4827788 it will be important to have developed a workable collective arrangement in europe which will meet german aspirations and by subsuming the u k s national capability set a useful example for japan before india goes nuclear
4827789 there were a few things that i worked on after the australian series early this year it was the off season and there were no domestic competitions so i had a few sessions with the bowling machine and worked ever so harder on my physical fitness
4827790 when you are going through a bad patch its very important not to panic there are so many factors that contribute to poor form and you just need to patiently work on them and the important thing is to revert to basics
4827791 i regained my touch towards the end of the ipl and was happy to be part of the asia cup squad it was a pleasant experience to win the tournament in pakistan we hadnt won any major competition in pakistan since winning the world cup
4827792 its hard to understand they are such a strong batting side for me the best in the world without any doubt but sri lanka gave india no chance they kept the pressure on and its not easy when ajantha mendis and murali bowl in tandem i thought sri lanka had a good plan which they executed to perfection there was someone to rise to the occasion at every crucial point
4827793 but i am sure they indians will bounce back sachin is a class act rahul and sourav are quality players the point is when you are having such a long career like they have had you are bound to have a poor series it happens to all players in the world but the problem here was all three of them struggled at the same time
4827794 i am really happy for what ajantha has done hes come up the hard way and his rise to stardom is something of a fairy tale hes a quiet kind of chap who wants to keep improving i have a particular liking for blokes who are the first to practice and the last to leave and mendis is something similar when you play at this level you need to keep working harder and improve your game every day
4827795 we believe that the netwrok of simi was behind the blasts indian mujahideen which claimed the responsibility of the blasts is connected to simi
4827796 today is the big day for gujarat police which has been able to crack the ahmedabad blasts case
4827797 the planning of the blasts was done in ahmedabad by simi joint commissioner of police of city crime branch ashish bhatia who is heading the inquiry said
4827798 extremely resilient they are highly fluid and adapt to law enforcement interventions
4827799 we were struck by just how little evidence there is to show that the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on uk enforcement each year has made a sustainable impact

4827942 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4827943 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4827944 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4827945 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4827946 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4827947 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4827948 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4827949 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4827950 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4827951 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4827952 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4827953 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4827954 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4827955 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4827956 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4827957 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4827958 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4827959 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4827960 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4827961 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4827962 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4827963 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4827964 i dont care what your doctors says your pills offend my belief
4827965 rene leiva a catholic family doctor in ottawa and a former board member of the canadian physicians for life said if the new rules were adopted it would make it nearly impossible for him to operate in the province
4827966 ontario physicians could be stripped of their right to exercise religious or moral conscience if a new set of guidelines is accepted by their regulating body next month critics say
4827967 doctor might refuse to help a same sex couple to use reproductive technology to have a child because they think its detrimental to the childs welfare down the road
4827968 why would you want your tax dollars to go to a community that you dont live in
4827969 if its the life of the person in question then maybe religious preferences go out the window
4827970 physicians should be aware that decisions to restrict medical services offered or to end physician patient relationships that are based on moral or religious belief may contravene the code and or constitute professional misconduct
4827971 i dont get involved in a lot of stuff im not trying to be in the papers every day i dont really want to be so id prefer just making music at the moment im in a really good place ive sold a lot of albums now its been an amazing year
4827972 as far as im concerned its completely insane but also i can walk around and very few people actually have any idea of what i look like which is the best of both worlds i was standing next to someone buying my album not so long ago i said thanks and they looked at me like i was completely insane

4827975 this is the countrys contribution to the global efforts against climate change
4827976 today firewood in the north is an intensive commercial activity it is a major source of employment for the people and if it is to be stopped an alternative source of employment must be sought
4827977 during this period we just have to pitch mosquito nets on the verandas and sleep outside our rooms throughout
4827978 for 9 or 10 years now the river beds have been empty these are streams which at one point were permanent but today you can find water in them only at the peak of the rainy season
4827979 in the final analysis the only way to salvage the situation is to plant trees to stop the encroaching desert but we should not plant just any trees they should be fast growing multi purpose trees
4827980 most of the issues of the developing countries are left on the sidelines because negotiations are concentrating only on the interests and differences between the major countries
4827981 of course you dont want to be left behind but you have to protect the market access first while you address the supply concerns
4827982 if you export unfinished goods you can even do it at zero tariffs but you try to add value and export finished goods you will not like it
4827983 how do we talk about industrialisation when four percent of our budget goes to agriculture
4827984 these are some of the things we need to put into perspective mr joseph mugambe a parliamentarian said a law whereby they tell us the positions before we go for negotiations or a fall back position should be put in place before that we shall be called fans
4827985 please accept with thanks and gratitude of the philippine nation for his services to his country
4827986 this world isnt going to give me happiness my only real chance is apart from it
4827987 as this thing gets rolling the newness will wear off and it gets down to playing and ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win no other reason
4827988 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys
4827989 you just cant go in with a hard number because the game especially in the preseason flows so differently that you dont know how long the defense is going be to out how long the offense is going to be out what the situation is going to be how long theyre going to keep their group out
4827990 so its hard to say its going to be this number hard and fast and thats what we are sticking to but usually youre trying to get 10 or 12 reps
4827991 theres going to be a big crowd out there the excitement thats being created around brett coming to us is giving us a lot of energy throughout camp so itll be fun come saturday
4827992 the big thing with him is getting comfortable with calling the plays
4827993 again the plays are the same thing but as a quarterback the more you call it the more you can become comfortable with it the more you can actually see the picture of the play in your mind
4827994 you see him in green bay and youre like you never know this guy could be throwing me passes someday and now that hes here its weird hes throwing me passes now and im just trying to make sure i dont make him mad and catch everything he throws my way
4827995 hopefully hell think hes so special that well only have to face him for a series or two
4827996 it would have been an easier offseason for me bretts all the hype and all the talk right now and thats fine now i can go back to work and just do what i do
4827997 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4827998 i told you all i was going to be no 1
4827999 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4828000 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4828001 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know

4828026 comunidades mapuche en conflicto del territorio lleu lleuche en la ribera del lago lleu lleu codiciado por transnacionales mineras que
4828027 como es propio de un preso politico mapuche y no de un delincuente
4828028 convocamos a manifestar nuestro repudio y realizar actos de protesta y solidaridad para apoyar al pueblo mapuche por ltimo no podemos dejar de mencionar el constante hostigamiento que sufrimos las comunidades en conflicto de arauko ya que ac tambi n tenemos presos pol ticos mapuche en muy malas condiciones carcelarias como son el lonko avelino me aco y pedro lepicheo recluidos en la c rcel de lebu
4828029 hacemos un llamado a las organizaciones colectivos agrupaciones sociedad civil y a todo el pueblo mapuche a estar atentos a esta arbitraria condici n a la que ha sido sometido nuestro werk n ya que obedece a una clara muestra de criminalizaci n y negaci n de los derechos de nuestro pueblo mapuche

4828032 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4828033 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4828034 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4828035 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4828036 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4828037 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4828038 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4828039 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4828040 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4828041 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4828042 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4828043 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4828044 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4828045 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4828046 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4828047 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4828048 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4828049 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4828050 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4828051 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4828052 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4828053 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4828054 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4828055 si ogie gandang ganda sa iyo si jolina finds your voice powerful sa akin you proved that youre not just a very good singer but also a performer

4828057 a group of liberal and far left activists far more interested in gay rights and abortion rights than christian evangelism
4828058 guys like rick warren and olsten are making the most radical pro abort democrats acceptable to evangelicals i have no use for his purpose driven life agenda which is really theological liberalism dressed up for the post modern world
4828059 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4828060 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4828061 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4828062 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4828063 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4828064 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4828065 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4828066 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4828067 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4828068 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4828069 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4828070 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4828071 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4828072 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4828073 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4828074 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4828075 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4828076 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4828077 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4828078 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4828079 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4828080 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4828081 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4828082 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4828083 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4828084 i have come to plant trees that is why i have left my jacket and tie in yaound
4828085 this is the countrys contribution to the global efforts against climate change
4828086 today firewood in the north is an intensive commercial activity it is a major source of employment for the people and if it is to be stopped an alternative source of employment must be sought
4828087 during this period we just have to pitch mosquito nets on the verandas and sleep outside our rooms throughout
4828088 for 9 or 10 years now the river beds have been empty these are streams which at one point were permanent but today you can find water in them only at the peak of the rainy season
4828089 in the final analysis the only way to salvage the situation is to plant trees to stop the encroaching desert but we should not plant just any trees they should be fast growing multi purpose trees
4828090 bipartisan effort will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards
4828091 raising taxes will ultimately hurt consumers by forcing them to pay even higher gas prices and republicans will oppose them
4828092 largely more of the same failed proposals theyve been trotting out for months
4828093 designed to give political cover to vulnerable democrats who are losing ground
4828094 the democratic leadership should bring up a clean bill give the members a chance to vote up or down on whether or not we should proceed with offshore drilling and not insert any legislative poison pills
4828095 those would be provisions that they know will never be enacted and are added only for the purpose of killing the effort to open up the outer continental shelf to drilling
4828096 rehashes washed up garbage that didnt have the ability to pass this house and theyre going to try to couple that with limited offshore production
4828097 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4828098 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4828099 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4828100 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4828101 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4828102 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4828103 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4828104 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4828105 france hasnt any oil but she knew how to exploit a rich idea in the whirlwind of globalization civil nuclear power became a weapon commercial and political that allowed the country to remain at the avant garde in the concert of nations
4828106 a lot of countries realize that with the rising price of fossil fuels and energy and the climate emergency nuclear can be part of the solution
4828107 this way nuclear energy can bring a lot its co2 free energy
4828108 replaces a gas powered electricity plant saves two billion cubic meters of gas each year and each e p r replacing a coal plant means cutting 11 million tons of co2
4828109 our system of security is extremely responsive and transparent and that the media and public opinion needed a training period to understand how the system of nuclear security works in france
4828110 at the regional level some towns accept having nuclear plants and others oil refineries
4828111 i dont ask bretons if theyre happy about having pigsties and raising pigs which creates another source of pollution

4828126 although he didnt seem in pain i rushed him straight to pdsa
4828127 the ball was stuck in louis stomach which was very lucky
4828128 if it had moved to the small intestines it could have been life threatening
4828129 luna quanti figli quanti amanti hai luna tu che vegli su poeti ladri e pescatori e per quelli come me una luna baster per fantasticare
4828130 in my family at home we watch the olympics all the time and sure we want the canadians to do well
4828131 you order a pizza while youre watching the olympics and you pay 15 or 20 bucks whatever that feeds you but it also makes it more enjoyable to watch the games when somebody wins a gold medal isnt that worth 20 bucks in enjoyment
4828132 we complain that we shouldnt spend money on sports but then we complain that we havent done well in sports and its because we havent spent the money
4828133 when silken laumann marnie mcbean and derek porter performed so well many of our kids were inspired by their success and took up rowing
4828134 some of those kids made it to the olympics others didnt
4828135 but every one of those kids benefited from learning dedication hard work teamwork and is a better person because of it
4828136 we need to put resouces into our olympians being a connected p r arm of health and welfare make it cool and desired to be fit
4828137 the medals will be a byproduct our marketing arm otherwise we spend more and more dollars on sick people both young and old
4828138 kids are going to be diving into the swimming pool and trying to do the breaststroke or figure out the butterfly running and jumping in parks fencing with anything they could find
4828139 my friend was camping with her daughter and she was in the water saying look mommy im rowing im not saying shes going to row at the olympics it is more than that its an inspiration from top to bottom
4828140 i think we need to keep supporting these athletes not just next week but the next four years in terms of giving the support thats required if we want to beat the world
4828141 otherwise dont come here and expect that all of a sudden for two weeks were going to beat the world when theres an amazing amount of support put out there financially by other nations we cant stop weve got to keep running
4828142 sport organizations are often the last refuge of the incompetent
4828143 i have read many of margaret atwoods books and im proud of her accomplishments but ive never jumped up and down on a couch when i heard margaret atwood wrote another book or michael ondaatje won a great literary award
4828144 i think weve moved forward to a time that the governor general also should have a sport award in the same way they honour arts and literature
4828145 i guess it goes to selling the message why sport is important
4828146 i just think its such an intricate part of society i look at my kids coming back from a workout and i see the jubiliation and feel the optimism that they have
4828147 maybe we need to spread that message more clearly promote the benefits of sport to society as well some countries understand it but i think canada sometimes grapples with it theres a perception that youre just funding the elite a small percentage but i think it benefits the whole society
4828148 but its a different story with summer athletes right now
4828149 i see it because i used to be a cyclist i know what its like
4828150 there is a lot of sponsorship money going into vanoc vancouver organizing committeee and into the coc right now but theres a void theres not money going into the athletes pocket
4828151 its a way of connecting to an olympic athletes journey
4828152 its an amazing ride ive brought people along on the ride many times it really is something special i think thats a part that is really missing in canada
4828153 just shut up and get in this plastic sharks mouth and ill take your picture and never mind how many disgusting people have been in there before you in their bathing suits with their shitty snot nosed kids just get in the sharks mouth
4828154 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4828155 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4828156 my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness
4828157 children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them
4828158 nothing you do for children is ever wasted they seem not to notice us hovering averting our eyes and they seldom offer thanks but what we do for them is never wasted
4828159 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4828160 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4828161 i can understand how some people can live just one paycheck from disaster it really struck a chord with me
4828162 some of them cried a little bit just big smiles all over the room
4828163 give me that fucking load boy come on dont make me wait you feel my cock buried in your ass just the way you like it your hot little ass filled with my cum come on baby let me take care of you give me that load
4828164 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4828165 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4828166 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4828167 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4828168 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4828169 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4828170 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4828171 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4828172 why conservatives work harder feel happier have closer families take fewer drugs give more generously value honesty more are less materialistic
4828173 liberals are meaner cheaper more willing to steal than conservatives
4828174 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4828175 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4828176 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4828177 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4828178 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4828179 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4828180 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination
4828181 we used to be young but suddenly were not our thighs have gone wide but we used to be hot wubyah wubyah wubyah
4828182 how i stopped raising my children and started raising h
4828183 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4828184 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4828185 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4828186 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4828187 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4828188 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4828189 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4828190 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4828191 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4828192 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4828193 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4828194 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4828195 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4828196 in a certain business people forget about the fact that they have to stay humble and you cant burn bridges with anyone because one day you never know when you ma y need that person
4828197 the best revenge is doing better than you did before im out for revenge and i got help from a really good source is it too late to repair the burned bridge
4828198 i was that which others did not want to be i went where others feared to go and did what others failed to do i asked nothing from those who gave nothing and reluctantly accepted the thought of eternal loneliness should i fail i have seen the face of terror felt the cold sting of fear and enjoyed the sweet taste of a moment of love i have cried pained and hoped but most of all i have lived times others would say were best forgotten at least someday i will be able to say i was proud of what i was
4828199 nonpartisan patriotism is the common thread tying together these reflections love letters and stories of combat they make for riveting reading
4828200 this collection is an excellent introduction to an emerging form of war reporting
4828201 there is much to tell and celebrate in the tough day to day work that our soldiers are doing in one of the most challenging environments any army has ever faced
4828202 we go into the fall if nothing else a tested organization
4828203 this is like a high stakes trapeze act that these guys have because mistakes and gaffes matter oh so much in these contests
4828204 he has the energy and the forward looking vision to lead
4828205 he has to deal with the ghost on the stage and probably has to do that in a dramatic way
4828206 people will be looking for obama to demonstrate a mastery of the questions
4828207 keeping him on an even keel at all times and not letting the situation rattle him in any way
4828208 he very seldom lets his emotions get the better of him which i think is very helpful
4828209 is a very nuanced thinker and thats good but sometimes in the expression of that it bogs him down a little bit so hes not as direct a speaker or performer as the best debaters have been
4828210 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4828211 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4828212 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4828213 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4828214 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4828215 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4828216 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4828217 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4828218 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4828219 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4828220 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4828221 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4828222 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4828223 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4828224 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4828225 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4828226 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4828227 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4828228 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4828229 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4828230 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4828231 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4828232 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4828233 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4828234 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4828235 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4828236 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4828237 we were prepared for the game but we just didnt play as well in the second half as we did in pre season
4828238 in the first half i think the team were coming together well and we played some good football
4828239 it became a fight at both ends in the second half and in those circumstances it was always possible a defensive error would settle the match which is what happened
4828240 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4828241 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4828242 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4828243 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4828244 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4828245 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4828246 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4828247 ese no es el tema fundamental hay que aprovechar que es la primera vez que hay una verdadera negociaci n para lograr entre todos un sistema consistente y coherente a largo plazo luego ya veremos el problema de las cantidades
4828248 el criterio para garantizar todos los servicios puede ser la poblaci n como quiere catalunya u otro distinto pero habr que encontrar una forma de financiaci n para aquellos otros servicios
4828249 me gustar a que los distintos grupos pol ticos hicieran lo mismo
4828250 el psoe tanto en el congreso como en el senado juega como un nico partido y as lo har a la hora de votar el presupuesto
4828251 its tough to scrounge up floor credentials but i did get in to see kemps acceptance speech and doles convention speech
4828252 its the first game of the season we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be sharp but we started well and were in control we just couldnt finish them off
4828253 you have that old story you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
4828254 when everybody is here we can create more clear cut chances because today the final ball was not good enough but overall it has been a good week for us
4828255 is a trophy to finish 12th and win the carling cup not for me you see the quality of a team after 38 games
4828256 in the carling cup or the fa cup you play five games in the final and could be drawn against second division teams but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship when youre a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4828257 levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and in the end two or three points is not a big gap we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries we finished with 83 points lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
4828258 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4828259 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4828260 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4828261 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4828262 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4828263 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4828264 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4828265 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4828266 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4828267 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4828268 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4828269 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4828270 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4828271 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4828272 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4828273 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4828274 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4828275 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4828276 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4828277 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4828278 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4828279 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4828280 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4828281 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4828282 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4828283 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4828284 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4828285 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4828286 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4828287 yes i can say that they patched the most serious of the vulnerabilities but i cannot confirm that they have patched or havent patched the other two
4828288 if you look at our timeline youll see that there was some disagreement about whether the two bugs were security bugs
4828289 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4828290 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4828291 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4828292 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4828293 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4828294 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4828295 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4828296 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4828297 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4828298 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4828299 i wont accept it because i cant accept it because i dont what else ill do if this fails
4828300 i will fight tooth and nail against anyone who tries to make me accept it because i will be too lost if this doesnt happen
4828301 okay im not going to be president but how about vice president or something so i dont have to face having nothing
4828302 its all real its not a bad dream i am lost and dont feel like doing anything else everybody just leave me alone
4828303 okay i guess i dont have nothing i still have my family i still have people who believed in me i still have a job in the senate i can still make a difference
4828304 my core value and life has been to be of service my daddy did and so have i for most of my adult life i like being an educator on the problems of global warming but i may actually have more leverage to help that and other initiatives as president and besides i will agree if elected to only serve one term where one of my most important roles is to mentor barack obama to be the real president who makes change happen after i leave office in 2012
4828305 christopher doesnt see women for what they should be he sees women for who they can be
4828306 what do you want your look to say to people
4828307 62 of all americans are part of a wireless mobile population that participates in digital activities away from home or work
4828308 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4828309 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4828310 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4828311 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4828312 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it
4828313 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4828314 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4828315 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4828316 the thoroughbred who leads too early and by too great a margin is more often than not the vulnerable one the one in danger of losing it all to the horse who strategically holds back waits and then thunders in the final furlongs to finish first
4828317 wake up youre liberal how we can take america back from the right
4828318 for i know the plans i have for you declaresd the lord plans not to harm you but to prosper you and give you hope for the future
4828319 grazie e visto che c laereo se lo ficchi su per il cu
4828320 our start made me seriously doubt our chances but we were able to control the match well after the strong start of argentina
4828321 we had the chance to eliminate them but they escaped we were through to the next round had royston drenthe scored in the last minute however weve been in china for two weeks now and we havent seen beijing and thats where its all happening
4828322 our first three matches were hardly a six on a scale of ten todays match was more toward an eight
4828323 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4828324 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4828325 firmly rejected the idea of a house vote solely on the issue of offshore oil drilling
4828326 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4828327 i learned a lot from letterman and leno while living in the states
4828328 that was the first time chinese people as a whole stood up to the world
4828329 its good for chinese people that incident proves that when chinese are upset they can find their voice
4828330 no less jingoistic than those who have never gone abroad
4828331 a significant proportion of them believe that using force to promote chinas national interests is acceptable
4828332 it means the post 1989 policy to imbue youth with nationalism through patriotic education has succeeded
4828333 they felt the most important thing was to help chinese education they wanted to teach
4828334 people say dai qings stupid after 20 years of going overseas she doesnt even have a green card
4828335 to be honest when we go abroad we do find people asking strange questions like whether china has modern buildings or cars
4828336 sometimes its hard not to feel they have some bias
4828337 theyre being anti western to feel attached to their own country
4828338 as soon as they get online they can be totally immersed in a chinese environment
4828339 when we were studying abroad occasionally you went to chinatown to read a chinese paper now if youre in the u k you can easily not read english papers or watch english tv
4828340 young chinese feel they have the right to speak out about anything
4828341 this generation doesnt want to accept any ideological message whether its from the communist party or voice of america
4828342 e per chiederti se ti avrebbe fatto piacere uscire col sottoscritto
4828343 perch rimandare a domani quello che si pu fare oggi
4828344 non pensarci nemmeno non stavamo facendo niente tu piuttosto come ti sei conciato
4828345 non proprio un gruppo ci divertiamo jim voce maschile e chitarra io sono voce femminile e basso mentre kyle alle percussioni ogni tanto emuliamo qualche pezzo cos per passare il tempo
4828346 ma se kyle ti ha portata qui significa che ci vedremo spesso almeno finch non succeder qualcosa di non previsto
4828347 sentirai le note della nostra dolce musica bambina e ne rimarrai talmente colpita che non riuscirai pi a farne a meno sarai costretta a venire qui ogni notte e ad unirti a noi non uscirai pi da questa dipendenza
4828348 ti avverto io di una cosa jim non chiamarmi mai pi bambina n in altro modo simile potresti pentirtene
4828349 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4828350 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4828351 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4828352 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4828353 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4828354 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4828355 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4828356 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4828357 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4828358 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4828359 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4828360 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4828361 it felt like history in the making one of those landmark films that people will be talking about for ever
4828362 we were always frustrated that people saw cg computer generated imagery as a genre as opposed to just a medium that could tell any kind of story we felt like we widened the palette with
4828363 i dont have much of a political bent and the last thing i want to do is preach i just went with things that i felt were logical for a possible future and supported the point of my story which was the premise that irrational love defeats lifes programming and that the most robotic beings ive met are us
4828364 its a wake up call telling people that the stewardship of the planet is a simple human responsibility but also that its a humans responsibility to live their life themes are not just topical theyre universal if you dont take action and you dont take responsibility and you dont exert your humanity you can lose it thats a timeless message but its not one you see in hollywood movies every day
4828365 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4828366 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4828367 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4828368 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4828369 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4828370 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4828371 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4828372 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4828373 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4828374 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4828375 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4828376 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4828377 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4828378 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4828379 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4828380 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4828381 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4828382 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4828383 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4828384 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4828385 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4828386 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4828387 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4828388 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4828389 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4828390 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4828391 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4828392 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4828393 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4828394 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4828395 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4828396 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4828397 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4828398 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4828399 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4828400 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4828401 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4828402 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4828403 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4828404 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4828405 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4828406 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4828407 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4828408 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4828409 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4828410 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4828411 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4828412 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4828413 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4828414 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4828415 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4828416 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4828417 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4828418 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4828419 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4828420 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4828421 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4828422 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4828423 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4828424 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4828425 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4828426 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast

4828430 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4828431 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4828432 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4828433 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4828434 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4828435 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4828436 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4828437 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4828438 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4828439 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4828440 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4828441 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4828442 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4828443 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4828444 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4828445 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4828446 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4828447 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4828448 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4828449 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4828450 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4828451 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4828452 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4828453 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4828454 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4828455 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4828456 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4828457 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4828458 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4828459 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4828460 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4828461 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4828462 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal

4828465 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4828466 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4828467 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4828468 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4828469 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4828470 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4828471 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4828472 mulder i saw their poorly executed video on youtube i dont know how you could think that what they say is even remotely plausible
4828473 just because theyre bad camera handlers doesnt mean they didnt really find bigfoot i think its worth checking it out
4828474 mulder we cant waste time or resources on this the u s fish and wildlife reserve said they arent taking the claim seriously and wont investigate bigfoot because its not a federal priority
4828475 scully when has the government ever had its priorities straight i think the government has colluded for decades to keep news of bigfoot from ever getting out
4828476 maybe its a smokescreen mulder maybe its supposed to distract us from the really scary story of today

4828479 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4828480 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4828481 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4828485 the provision of additional dietary hydroxyproline to ghs rats increases urinary oxalate excretion calcium oxalate supersaturation and the ratio of calcium oxalate to calcium phosphate supersaturation resulting in the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones thus with the addition of a common amino acid the ghs rats now not only model the most common metabolic abnormality found in patients with nephrolithiasis hypercalciuria but form the most common type of kidney stone calcium oxalate

4828493 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries

4828504 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4828505 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

4828513 prime minister harper and president bush spoke saturday morning to discuss the situation in georgia
4828514 both leaders welcomed the cease fire agreement and expressed hope russian troops would withdraw quickly from georgian territory
4828515 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4828516 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4828517 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4828518 these questions are not decided by condoleezza rice or somebody else they are decided first of all by the side that has suffered in the conflict

4828526 oh yeah thats cause they had to completely rebuild the town after the war youll see the beach it really broad and flat so the germans though that when the allies would invade they might do it here so to keep the germans thinking that the british bombed the town to the ground the raf tried to make a memorial here for all the pilots that were killed and the town would let them theyre not big fans of the british here since they reduced the town rubble
4828527 the market is oversupplied by at least 1 million barrels a day if opec would like to remove this additional oil out of the market then opec has to cut some production

4828549 what has been called the long war is likely to be many years of persistent engaged combat all around the world in differing degrees of size and intensity this generational campaign cannot be wished away or put on a timetable there are no exit strategies to paraphrase the bolshevik leon trotsky we may not be interested in the long war but the long war is interested in us
4828550 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u

4828565 iran cannot attack israel because of the weight of history that puts iran on the side of defenders of jewish rights to a homeland and by the same token israel cannot attack iran because first it would be acting against its own conscience and second it would be making a strategic error by weakening the non arab bloc in the middle east
4828566 the iran contra affair when israel replenished irans inventory of arms during the iran iraq war in the 1980s happened for a reason it showed realpolitik instead of ideological noise ruling the policy makers in tehran and tel aviv and the logic of limited cooperation call it a temporary marriage of convenience back then is not entirely absent today with the threats of terrorism etc
4828567 we dont have in our terms of agreement that if you miss a day you get a credit
4828568 we just do that voluntarily because its the right thing to do
4828569 es ist f r mich schwer vorstellbar wenn man einmal hier war ins stadion eingelaufen ist mit so vielen leuten dass man dann im n chsten jahr in polen em spielt
4828570 the whole idea is to promote hindi in europe if hindi dies among second generation indians from north india in europe their links with india will also die as language is a crucial aspect of culture so we thought that inculcating love of the language was important for inculcating the love of india
4828571 we found that hindi was ignored so we began this initiative
4828572 when i was victimised it only made me stronger if i had to live my life again id do the same
4828573 this iit alumnus spurned offers from the private sector to join ndmc in 1969 hoping to contribute to national development he was soon disillusioned
4828574 move along let me have my parantha in peace owner bhagwat singh verma says aloo pyaz parantha with curd is favoured the most here anda parantha comes only second
4828575 like former india cricket captain ajay jadeja and his wife and bollywood actor rishi kapoor
4828576 my patrons are from all over the city and come to connaught place to work see movies or just shop around if you come here once you will keep coming
4828577 a lot of them are millionaires who might get embarrassed
4828578 i come here once a week to have at least to have pyaaz parantha
4828579 the idea is to point a gun at the desired direction keep it as steady as you can and pull the trigger
4828580 i am essentially a pistol shooter so ill ask a good rifle shooter to assist you
4828581 he told us that maanvi was suffering from some complexes then he gave us some exercises talked at length to maanvi he proved to be a good mediator
4828582 its a new concept in india we have a dialogue with the parents to help them understand their children better and develop their own solutions
4828583 helping parents understand the concept of various parenting styles introspect and identify their own style
4828584 the course taught me how to communicate with my unborn child we used to show him flash cards from one he started crawling after just a month and is very sharp
4828585 a decline in eq results in behavioural problems our workshops train parents to manage childrens emotions
4828586 they are only isolating children from parents and undermining the relationship good parenting is about instilling values and has to come from the family
4828587 our role is limited to building cooperation and harmony between the two
4828588 urban trends like inter caste marriages nuclear families and late night partying are throwing up new challenges for parents of teenaged children even grandparents attend our workshops
4828589 the increasing dominance of punjab in this sport is because of the shooting culture in the state and our youngsters are focused and hard working
4828590 we used to get just 40 to 50 entries for the state championships five years ago
4828591 earlier the state used to boast of shotgun shooters but with the meteoric rise of bindra rifle events have gained in popularity too the improved infrastructure has had a massive impact on the sports popularity
4828592 currently there are 50 to 60 girls pursuing air rifle shooting in the state
4828593 the trend of building ranges in schools and colleges for 10m air rifle and pistol events has given a boost to the sport
4828594 it wouldnt be surprising if more girls from the state make it to the senior national squad soon
4828595 when i was young i used to hear about randhirs triumphs and nurtured the dream of shooting alongside him i realised my dream in 1983 when randhir gurbir and i were part of the same team for the asian championships in jakarta we won a bronze there
4828596 it is a mission that started in july 1998 behind a dilapidated mosque in johri village in baghpat more than 400 marksmen have taken to the sport now its the only means of emancipation here for the poverty stricken
4828597 today 20 odd villages in baghpat district have given the country more than 60 national and international shooters one of our shooters seema tomar is the national record holder in the trap event they have also provided jobs for more than a hundred marksmen our motto is simple we have to wean youngsters away from crime as baghpat is a crime infested area where guns dictate terms
4828598 earlier the sport was the domain of the very rich and affluent like dr karni singh the maharaja of bikaner but all that changed when rana as an 18 year old struck gold in the world championships commonwealth games and the asian games all in the same year ranas feats caught the imagination of a lot of youngsters
4828599 the demand grew so much after rathores olympic silver that the old equipment imported before the 1982 asian games could not cater to the burgeoning number of shooters coming to play under the pay and play scheme at the karni singh ranges in delhi
4828600 the period between 2000 and 2004 belonged to anjali as she won multiple world cup medals after her world no 1 title and her haul of four golds at the 2002 commonwealth games i could see girl power increasing in rifle and pistol events all over the country
4828601 earlier only the top 10 shooters in every category of shooting sport could import guns and cartridges now everyone who participates in the nationals and shoots a minimum qualifying score can get an import licence
4828602 there has been a 1 000 per cent increase in the number of shotgun shooters in pistol and rifle events its much more because of the low costs involved where there used to be a handful of shotgun marksmen in the country in 1993 today there are more than 700
4828603 everyone started copying rathores stance and buying the same brand of guns after he won an olympic silver
4828604 this will all die down if the government doesnt come up with a proper plan the sports authority of india is not serious about its pay and play scheme
4828605 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war
4828606 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4828607 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4828608 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4828609 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4828610 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4828611 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4828612 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4828613 i dont think anybody here believes that is it easier to win without peyton no its going to be tougher but if it happens well believe we can get it done
4828614 i think the bottom line is that i expect peyton to be back ive been with him everything is going like we expect it to
4828615 do i wish everyone was 100 healthy of course but in this business you have to be able to fight through it you have to be able to deal with injuries and go forward
4828616 i dont worry about that i leave that stuff up to the training staff
4828617 everybody has confidence in each other so we dont worry about that stuff
4828618 you cant look at it as we have a built in excuse
4828619 if hes not back by the fourth preseason game youve got to handle that if hes not back for the first regular season youve got to handle it but hes on schedule
4828620 to have won at least silver is already an achievement in this respect there is no other athlete in the olympic village who has won two olympic medals in two different events
4828621 but its not finished yet and im not going to be content with that i have the gold medal to look forward to and im not going to let it go
4828622 the french doors that had been installed in the kitchen were just not correct to the period of the house
4828623 plus they let in too much light and heat in the summer and too much cold in the winter
4828624 we couldnt put the nook back precisely where it was because then wed have no back door which is required to say nothing of practical
4828625 we got really lucky finding photos and also that some of mays relatives were still in the area
4828626 people werent as mobile then they bought a house and stayed in it until they died
4828627 these were working class families who built these houses carpenters salesmen seamstresses cannery workers the homes were passed down through the family
4828628 if you stick with it its amazing what you can uncover
4828629 i take the things that are told me with a grain of salt
4828630 we dont do anything to make the rooms smell like that they just do
4828631 the shower turned on on me i was kind of hot but not that hot
4828632 why did you get up so many times last night
4828633 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4828634 i told you all i was going to be no 1
4828635 he was definitely untouchable tonight he could have gone a lot faster if he had run straight through the line
4828636 anything is possible the human body is changing so you never know
4828637 i aim just to win but when i saw the replay i was amazed
4828638 initially a company fore vintage requested for 75 youth workers who were dispatched from kiribati in four groups
4828639 the youths then complained of accommodation salary conditions and other disappointments with fore vintage and after a negotiation with a labor official from kiribati three other employers provided work for our youths leaving the fore vintage company but these four new employers lately can no longer afford to keep our youth workers saying theres no more work for them and therefore had to lay them off
4828640 in the first report they said five are coming home
4828641 later it increased to 24 and in the last minutes there are 35 of them
4828642 that which you feel is pride it is the demon which inspires you with this sentiment it is not true sorrow
4828643 father how can you then distinguish what comes form the heart and is inspired by our lord and that which instead is inspired by the devil
4828644 always by this the spirit of god is a spirit of peace and also in the case of grave sin it makes us feel tranquil sorrow humble confident and this is due precisely to his mercy the spirit of the demon on the contrary excites exasperates and makes us in our sorrow feel something like anger against ourselves and so if certain thought agitate you this agitation never comes from god who gives tranquility being the spirit of peace such agitation comes from the devil
4828645 generations of the american people have surged through the preambles portal and widened its gate like constitutions amendments are not just words but deeds flesh and blood struggles to redeem americas promise while making amends for some of the sins of our fathers

4828652 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4828653 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4828654 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4828655 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values

4828672 the desire to rule is the mother of all heresy
4828673 leaning toward sen john mccain because she shares his economic views and is afraid that sen barack obama will raise taxes
4828674 senator mccains tax cuts would primarily benefit those with very high incomes
4828675 senator obama offers much larger tax breaks to low and middle income taxpayers and would increase taxes on high income taxpayers
4828676 it is amazing how a creature so fragile can achieve such immeasurable superiority
4828677 its more of the usual dishonest crap from the right so what i want to know is will there be any consequences are you at all pissed off that theyre lying to you and playing you like a flute or are you just going to suck it up and have you checked to see what else theyre lying to you about

4828686 we have the ability so we will try to develop and achieve even better results than we did last season
4828687 i believe we can do it because even though we have no new signings we havent lost any players either which is the most important thing
4828688 hes doing very well hes well ahead of schedule and the specialists were surprised with the condition that hes in
4828689 for the next three weeks hell be on rehabilitation then endurance work and serious running before he goes into the football side with us
4828690 the new additions dont really matter because we know kevins style kevin always has a go and thats a great quality the lads got and i think well find that on sunday
4828691 im looking forward to the united match im fit and ready to play and hopefully can make a real difference to the team i cant wait to get started
4828692 i know carlos very well and i know the way that he plays im looking forward to trying to put one over on him on sunday its an exciting prospect
4828693 for me personally i dont consider it a risk playing at old trafford because ive got to play my first match somewhere so why not sunday
4828694 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
4828695 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
4828696 all the things that im hearing are that they are going to make those kind of recommendations
4828697 so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with competition but i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up

4828701 no estoy feliz ellos han jugado con mucha m s intensidad y no hemos sido capaces de jugar con la misma intensidad veintiocho robos de bal n es un n mero con el que no puedes tener posibilidad de ganar
4828702 no supimos responder es muy frustrante estar ah y no saber responder en ataque ha sido duro
4828703 espero enfrentarme a ellos otra vez y haberme ganado esa oportunidad
4828704 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4828705 es bueno ganar contundentemente a los rivales m s duros eso es una buena actitud de equipo
4828706 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y entonces pues coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota

4828714 jason is second in the championship and could still win it while i cant so theres no point me robbing points off him
4828715 if he ends the season three points off the title because of me finishing ahead of him in a race weve achieved nothing as a team
4828716 im fine with that because were a team here its not like someone is getting on the radio when youre leading and telling you to pull over thats a difficult situation but this is a case of recognising whats best for the team and putting together a gameplan
4828717 they the team told me darren you just go out and get pole and well see what we can manage with jason on his 36 kilos of ballast and thankfully he got second so i think were looking pretty strong
4828718 yesterday i was running out of energy very quickly and had to keep coming in to sit for a few minutes but this morning i woke up and felt completely different

4828720 in the dry its quite slippery and hard on the front tyres so we didnt know what to expect in the wet
4828721 but it faired quite well and there wasnt too much water

4828760 sanofi pasteur the vaccines division of sanofi aventis group announced today that the u s department of health and human services hhs has accepted h5n1 bulk vaccine antigen to produce approximately 38 5 million doses of vaccine to protect against a new strain of avian influenza sanofi pasteur has a multi year contract with hhs as part of its pandemic program and will receive a payment of 192 5 million booked in the second quarter of 2008 for acceptance of the bulk vaccine lot in 2007 sanofi pasteur received 126 9 million for its bulk pandemic vaccine
4828761 sanofi aventis is to build a new influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in china
4828762 in recent years more and more western pharmaceutical corporations such as gsk roche novo nordisk and others have come to china and set up r amp d centers
4828763 as of 2004 three years after chinas wto entry nearly all global pharmaceutical companies have already completed their accession into the chinese market and will gradually shift their focus to research development the main reasons for overseas companies coming to china have been to save costs by using the extensive science and technology research bases currently in place in china the abundant human resources and less expensive medical and clinical trials
4828764 mutations of the traditional influenza virus cannot naturally become deadly virulent it takes laboratory assistance and the addition of toxic adjuvants in a prepared vaccine to accomplish this task in short the only way for a pandemic to occur is if it is pre planned and lab induced as a biological weapon
4828765 a reader has asked me to comment on the rather alarming document reproduced on august 8 2005 in epoch times
4828766 what about the several millions of our compatriots in the united states
4828767 there are 6 7 billion humans on planet earth this equates to a statistical infection rate of 000000004215 percent in other words statistically speaking you are over 100 000 times more likely to be hit by lightning in your home than to contract the bird flu
4828768 the world is teetering on the edge of a flu pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population
4828769 an outbreak of avian influenza would kill between 5 million and 150 million people on each continent
4828770 the current u s capacity for manufacturing egg based vaccines is not sufficient to supply our entire population hhs is supporting research into human kidney cell based vaccine manufacture of producing vaccine domestically
4828771 the fda can use its emergency use authorization authority to permit the use of unapproved products if theres a reasonable belief the products may be effective
4828772 they always tell you what their going to do before they do it
4828773 you wouldnt go out to the movies you wouldnt congregate with people
4828774 youd pretty much be staying home with the doors and windows battened down
4828775 depending on how fast it is spreading it seems as though you really need to throw everything you can at it
4828776 we are not talking about simply shutting things down for a day or two like a snow day
4828777 in the context of a very infectious disease that is killing a large number of the people i think large fractions of the population wont have a problem with these recommendations
4828778 weve made significant progress not that we dont have a lot more to do
4828779 if you dont have enough resources to take care of all the patients who are critical how do you make the decisions about standard of care

4828785 what i find so satisfying about tefaf is the level of questions you get there
4828786 i could sit here for a year and not get as many informed questions about the work on hand as i get in an hour at the fair eighty percent of our business is done outside california anyway
4828787 were always thinking can we get it conserved in time can we get all the paperwork in place there are a lot of paintings well bring for the first time
4828788 i had discovered this wonderful dutch mannerist painting it was thought to be a fake rubens but turned out to be a genuine hendrick goltzius it went from being a fake rubens at 25 000 to being a right goltzius at 1 5 million we once had an anton raphael mengs a view of the great castle at bayreuth which is not something we would normally handle but put out there in that marketplace it sold immediately to the german government to go back to bayreuth
4828789 then shipping we have these show containers that we send over waterproof lined and sealed and all that it will probably cost about 8 000 round trip for shipping and insurance we have built into our insurance policy that we do three or four fairs a year and i think its for between 7 million and 10 million worth of art which is not much when you look at the price of art these days
4828790 we had that coveted corner position once or twice and we would have as many as 900 to 1 200 people an hour passing through the stand thats too many people you cant concentrate on those who are really interested when you need to answer their questions
4828791 then at a february event at california college of the arts
4828792 in conversation with ann hatch and others the question of the houses fate again came up it was then a couple of weeks away from being put on the market she asked if id like to come and see it so the next day ann showed me through the house my jaw dropped as i walked through i realized that this is an amazing place
4828793 i knew if it went on the market a developer would come and snap it up
4828794 as both davids longtime friend and as his appointed art executor will be to work closely with david to create an inventory of his artwork and domestic possessions that will be gifted to carlies new nonprofit entity once it is legally established for many artists who came of age in san francisco during the 1970s and 1980s davids home and all that creatively and socially transpired within it came to be considered a genuine masterpiece of contemporary art
4828795 my hope is that any work related to the house comes back to the house
4828796 there are some works created out of a relationship with david so there will be a few works incorporated by other artists that are directly related to the house
4828797 essentially the house has been an ever evolving installation a hybrid between a home studio museum and artwork
4828798 this evolution has been well documented photographically and i propose to gather the photographs of the house and accompany them with an essay detailing the history of the house and how irelands approach to it has influenced not only his own future work but also that of may prominent artists today
4828799 i still cant say goodbye to him today because hes still in my heart and i cant stop thinking about him
4828800 it is with great humility today that i stand here representing the american people in appreciation of sgt kenneth hobsons life in the scriptures it says no greater love hath any man than that he lay down his life for another that was what sgt hobson did and he did it for us he did it so we can have the freedom that america so uniquely enjoys america will continue to be the land of the free because it is the home of the brave
4828801 his sacrifice and the sacrifice of his family are evidenced today by the medals and recognition that he will not see but that his family will hold for him since he is not here the legion of merit the purple heart and the defense meritorious service medal were all earned in a sacrifice that few of us are asked to make
4828802 the cowardly terrorists who did this must know that there is a price to pay and they must be made to pay it
4828803 more intensive than ever before because we wouldnt want to miss him now
4828804 we spent more than two years working with jeremy wariner the best curve runner in the world to design the adidas lone star
4828805 we know long sprint races are won and lost in the curves so we looked at what he already does best and from there created the finest curve running shoes in the world the adidas lone star allows jeremy to push even better in the turn and provides him with even more physical confidence stability and efficiency

4828812 could you spell that out to me with the authors name too
4828813 a good dream that comes true of a righteous man is one of forty six parts of prophet hood
4828814 there are three types of dreams 1 true dreams 2 a dream in which a person is speaking to himself i
4828815 sometimes i would see a dream that would be heavier on me than carrying a mountain but since i heard this hadith i wouldnt care about the bad dream i would see
4828816 if anyone of you sees a dream that he likes then it is from allah and he should thank allah for it and narrate it to others but if he sees something else i e a dream that he dislikes then it is from satan and he should seek refuge with allah from its evil and he should not mention it to anybody for it will not harm him
4828817 most of the dreams of the righteous people are good dreams because sometimes a righteous person could see a dream that is meaningless but that is not very frequent because shaytaans control on them is very weak
4828818 you should not mention this dream to an envious person
4828819 o my father verily i saw in a dream eleven stars and the sun and the moon i saw them prostrating themselves to me
4828820 o my son relate not your vision to your brothers lest they arrange a plot against you verily shait n satan is to man an open enemy
4828821 whoever has seen me in a dream then no doubt he has seen me for satan cannot imitate my shape
4828822 as long as you felt in your dream that the person you saw was prophet then it is him even if he comes in a different form
4828823 i see that your dreams strengthen each other that night of qadr is in the last seven nights of ramadhan so whoever searches for it would search for it in the last seven days of ramadan
4828824 dreams of day time are equal to the dreams of night
4828825 dreams are of two types a clear evident dream like somebody would dream about himself giving dates to someone and during the day time he would give somebody dates this type of dream doesnt need any interpretation secondly a dream that comes in symbols and this type you would understand its meaning unless you get it interpreted by a person who has knowledge and experience dream interpretation because sometimes the symbols are very delicate and sophisticated
4828826 what is meant by this hadith and allah knows best is the end of times and it is talking about the group of believers that will be with isa ibn maryam says
4828827 whenever the times are difficult for the believer he will see dreams that are true frequently because he needs help when the believer is alone when the times are difficult when you dont find people supporting on truth then allah will inspire you to give you glad tidings through the good dreams you would see and this is to give the believers in those difficult and testing times gives the believers strength it gives them confidence it gives them hope so they would see a lot of dreams that would come true
4828828 benefit of the dream in giving the believer a glad tiding or warning not in legislation and judgement or rulings
4828829 ibrahim al humaydi was righteous man and imam ahmad bin hanbal visited him so ibrahim told imam ahmad my mother has seen a dream for you where she saw this and that for you and then he mentioned jannah imam ahmad said my brother sahl ibn salamah people used to see dreams for him similar to what you mentioned and in the end he ended up shedding blood so the dream pleases the believer it doesnt make him boastful
4828830 and he said to the one he presumed to be saved
4828831 if her dream is true it means that she would marry three noble men all of them would be killed
4828832 alright i am going to divorce you since you think i am going to be killed now
4828833 whoever claims to have seen a dream that he has not seen would be told to tie between two hairs on the day of judgement
4828834 because i saw in the first mans face righteousness and allah made adhan calling people to hajj so i interpreted this mean that this person would make hajj whilst i saw evil on the face of the other man and allah
4828835 you will see after me selfishness on the part of other people and other matters that you will disapprove of
4828836 what do you order us to do o allahs apostle under such circumstances
4828837 pay their rights to them to the rulers and ask your right from allah

4828942 the brain of this gcps machine functions but possesses neither a heart nor a soul
4828943 too complicated for us to understand certain aspects of the situation
4828944 it distracts us from paying attention to the importance of building a culture of schooling that is genuinely intellectual in character that values questions and ideas at least as much as getting right answers the challenge in teaching is to provide the conditions that will foster the growth of those personal characteristics that are socially important and at the same time personally satisfying to the student the aim of education is not to train an army that marches to the same drummer at the same pace toward the same destination such an aim may be appropriate for totalitarian societies but it is incompatible with democratic ideals
4828945 world class standards are qualitative measures of the performance or attributes of a product service or organization they are acknowledged accepted and admired by customers stakeholders and competitors alike as measures that distinguish the product service or organization as one of the best in its class
4828946 i am not aware that any clear world class standards exist in education since the world is so diverse in its cultures and philosophies therefore i dont believe that world class is an appropriate clear and compelling term words like customer product and value added are too business oriented the belief that principles of corporate america can be successfully applied in public schools is erroneous lacking both philosophical validity and empirical support

4828952 leaders are people who do the right thing managers are people who do things right both roles are crucial but they differ profoundly i often observe people in top positions doing the wrong thing well
4828953 you can lead an organization through persuasion or formal edict i have never found the arbitrary use of authority to control an organization either effective or for that matter personally interesting if you cannot persuade your colleagues of the correctness of your position it is probably worthwhile to rethink your own

4828967 what about symbols that have become secular the supreme court has held that a christmas tree has become such a secular symbol of the winter holiday season that its display by a public entity does not violate the establishment clause 40 the supreme court has also found that a hanukkah menorah is a symbol with both secular and religious meanings and its display by a public entity other than a school within a predominantly secular holiday display does not offend the establishment clause 41 the supreme court has not addressed whether such a display is permissible in the public school context but it has noted that a schools display of a christmas tree and menorah could raise additional constitutional concerns 42 however lower courts have not invalidated such displays and it is likely that they are permissible even setting aside the legal questions for a moment teachers and school administrators should be extremely cautious in using these symbols as decorations the classroom and school premises are the place where children spend the majority of their day it is important that all students feel comfortable and accepted in their school symbols of religious holidays may make some students uncomfortable and unwelcome because their holidays and traditions are not represented or because they do not celebrate religious holidays at all

4828973 n o religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
4828974 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
4828975 congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise thereof
4828976 the free exercise of religion means first and foremost the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires thus the first amendment obviously excludes all governmental regulation of religious beliefs as such the government may not compel affirmation of religious belief punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes to be false impose special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status or lend its power to one or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma
4828977 valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes or prescribes conduct that his religion prescribes or proscribes
4828978 the office of inspector general oig at the u s department of education ed conducts audits investigations and inspections of education programs and operations anyone knowing of fraud waste or abuse of department of education funds should contact the oig fraud hotline to make a confidential report
4828979 to the month to month employee with evidence i spoke to mr porter today about how to maintain confidentiality so that information and evidence can be received from people that dont feel comfortable coming forward and identifying themselves
4828980 public policy dictates that hope an experienced 17 year veteran educator who works directly teaching and evaluating the very students to be tested be able to actively participate in the public debate regarding the test and share with the concerned parties the benefit of his hands on experience
4828981 i felt that putting young children through such unnecessary terror for the sake of a politically motivated phony high standards movement was abusive
4828982 what was particularly frustrating and what most people did not know is that the passing scores had been set so low that virtually anyone could pass
4828983 for instance on the social studies portion of the test a fourth grade student needed 14 points out of a total of 59 or 23 7 percent to earn a passing grade even though i had children crying because they thought they were going to fail the fourth grade despite all their hard work i knew that everyone would pass but could not tell them that
4828984 the reason that i think the school system was so determined to get rid of me is due to other action i have taken that shows the gateway to be a bad test
4828985 i am responsible for giving reporters information about the test i voluntarily testified two times to gwinnett grand juries about the inadequacies of gateway testing
4828986 in the summer of 2000 a gwinnett county school police officer visited my house three times including on a sunday with gun on hip
4828987 the school police tried to implicate me in the theft and dissemination of the gateway before its 2000 administration
4828988 in september 2000 i was forced to take a lie detector test in hall county i found out during this interrogation that the school police had confiscated my phone records they asked me about conversations i had with each teacher whose name appeared on my phone list and if i had spoken with them about the investigation
4828989 i owe a lot to james hope without a firm foundation our kids have nothing james hope gives our kids that foundation i say he was guilty 11 years ago too because he did the same thing for me
4828990 gwinnett superintendent alvin wilbanks applauds the professional standards commissions ruling in the case of james hope as evidence that the education profession demands high ethical standards and integrity among its practitioners
4828991 public policy dictates that hope an experienced 17 year veteran educator who works directly teaching and evaluating the very students to be tested be able to actively participate in the public debate regarding the test and share with the concerned parties the benefit of his hands on experience with the students the test and its administration
4828992 it distracts us from paying attention to the importance of building a culture of schooling that is genuinely intellectual in character that values questions and ideas at least as much as getting right answers the challenge in teaching is to provide the conditions that will foster the growth of those personal characteristics that are socially important and at the same time personally satisfying to the student the aim of education is not to train an army that marches to the same drummer at the same pace toward the same destination such an aim may be appropriate for totalitarian societies but it is incompatible with democratic ideals
4828993 world class standards are qualitative measures of the performance or attributes of a product service or organization they are acknowledged accepted and admired by customers stakeholders and competitors alike as measures that distinguish the product service or organization as one of the best in its class
4828994 i am not aware that any clear world class standards exist in education since the world is so diverse in its cultures and philosophies therefore i dont believe that world class is an appropriate clear and compelling term words like customer product and value added are too business oriented the belief that principles of corporate america can be successfully applied in public schools is erroneous lacking both philosophical validity and empirical support
4828995 remove barriers to pride in workmanship and barriers that rob people of joy in their work
4828996 do not run companies by the numbers eliminate numerical goals numerical quotas and management by objectives
4828997 drive out fear and build trust so that everyone can work more effectively
4828998 who is more qualified to direct instruction regarding the specific subjects being taught your children
4828999 are all these standardized examinations true indicators of what a child actually knows or how he she will fare in college or in life or merely how accomplished the student has become at mastering the plethora of test taking strategies taught him her throughout a dozen years of schooling and indoctrination

4829001 you can lead an organization through persuasion or formal edict i have never found the arbitrary use of authority to control an organization either effective or for that matter personally interesting if you cannot persuade your colleagues of the correctness of your position it is probably worthwhile to rethink your own

4829004 the government finance officers association gfoa makes the following recommendations regarding the establishment of audit committees by state and local governments the governing body of every state and local government should establish an audit committee or its equivalent all members of the audit committee should be members of the governing body it is the responsibility of the audit committee to provide independent review and oversight of a governments financial reporting processes internal controls and independent auditors the audit committee should have access to the reports of internal auditors as well as access to annual internal audit work plans the audit committee should establish procedures for the receipt retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting internal accounting controls or auditing matters such procedures should specifically provide for the confidential anonymous submission by employees of the government of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters

4829178 on sunday morning with father mother and tom at breakfast i produced the extra two dollars and a quarter the surprise was great and it took some moments for them to grasp the situation but it soon dawned upon them then fathers glance of loving pride and mothers blazing eye soon wet with tears told their feeling it was their boys first triumph and proof positive that he was worthy of promotion no subsequent success or recognition of any kind ever thrilled me as this did i cannot even imagine one that could here was heaven upon earth my whole world was moved to tears of joy

4829187 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4829200 what suffers in the atmosphere of immediacy is analysis what suffers in this search for speed is depth the media in the wealthy world are becoming increasingly simplistic superficial and celebrity focused
4829201 cinema radio television magazines are a school of inattention people look without seeing listen in without hearing

4829303 in the jurisdictions studied whites adults and females were found to be the predominant victims of family violence but within particular offenses some variance with this general profile is evident
4829304 although women can be violent in relationships with men and violence is also sometimes found in same sex partnerships the overwhelming burden of partner violence is borne by women at the hands of men
4829305 although there is evidence from industrialized countries that women engage in common couple violence there are few indications that women subject men to the same type of severe and escalating violence frequently seen in clinical samples of battered women

4829329 ik wist al gauw hoe je haar over de rooie kon krijgen
4829330 samen met een stel anderen gelijkgestemden zeg maar wisten we haar feilloos in die hoek te krijgen waar we wilden
4829331 we speelden het zo dat het net leek of zij echt niet te handhaven was in onze verder onberispelijke klas
4829332 ik bedoel zon jan wolkers bijvoorbeeld was best een geinige kerel natuurlijk ik heb alles van hem gelezen maar je zal zon idioot in de klas hebben
4829333 ja ze had nog wel een paar medestanders maar de meeste durfden hun bek toch niet open te doen
4829334 nee de meeste vinden het wel best zolang ze zelf maar niet in kijkert staan ha ha ha

4829348 wer verbindlichkeit will der muss sie auch in die andere richtung zeigen dann muss man mit uns auch das gesamte personaltableau bereden
4829349 ich habe probiert irgendwelche erkl rungen zu finden aber ich habe dann irgendwann gesp rt das sind alles so emotionale schnellsch sse wo ich mir gedacht habe ich h tte so gerne eine medaille ich h tte am liebsten irgendwas was sich pr sentiert wie die aufgehende sonne und sagt deswegen hast du verloren genau deswegen und nicht wegen etwas anderem das war der hauptgrund aber das ist eben nur ein verlangen das ist nur so ein versuch schnell damit abzuschlie en sagen okay das war jetzt eine lektion das war jetzt eine interessante erfahrung ich bin fertig und ich mach jetzt weiter in wahrheit ist es nicht so in wahrheit ist schwimmen viel komplizierter es ist der mentale aspekt vom rennen viel viel gr er und ich muss mich gedulden ich brauche die zeit um draufzukommen was da wirklich los war da werde ich schon ein paar wochen brauchen
4829350 es gibt nichts einfacheres als einen sieg zu erkl ren weil im zweifelsfall hast du eh recht und lustigerweise w re es ja genauso wenn ich mit der zeit von gestern gewonnen h tte h tte ich 100 gr nde gehabt warum ich gewonnen h tte ich h tte nie angefangen nach den gr nden f r die niederlage zu suchen aber das spannende ist ja herauszufinden und einen grund zu suchen warum man verloren hat
4829351 ja ich wollte das das war meine erste reaktion weg weg von allem wir haben heute christine und ich alle m glichen fl ge gesucht wo wir uns so schnell wie m glich verstecken k nnen aber das ist ja nicht mehr als wegrennen in wahrheit ist es schon schlauer oder jedenfalls ges nder zu berlegen warum ich verloren habe der grund liegt ja nicht nur im wasser das hat ja viele gr nde
4829352 bis 150 m bin ich mein perfektes rennen geschwommen und ich kann mich genau erinnern wie ich kurz vor der wende war und ich mir gedacht habe okay das kann ich jetzt noch gewinnen was eigentlich ein kompletter bl dsinn war wenn ich den letzten 50er im nachhinein sehe ich habe bei 165 meter gemerkt dass ich nicht gewinnen werde da habe ich mir gedacht okay ich will jetzt wenigstens eine medaille und wie ich nachher gemerkt habe dass ich nicht einmal das geschafft habe ist es auf der einen seite nett weil ich nicht in so einer halbsituation bin wo ich sozusagen nicht schlecht aber auch nicht gut geschwommen bin jetzt bin ich in einer viel klareren situation ich wei ich bin eindeutig schlecht geschwommen die bronze medaille ist ja nicht so schlecht w re ein elegantes versteck gewesen jetzt bin ich mit der perfekten niederlage konfrontiert das ist ja auch irgendwie spannend
4829353 das ist aber wirklich egal das sind alle anderen drei vor mir auch
4829354 das wei ich nicht ich w rde mir sicher leichter tun eine medaille als erfolg zu verkaufen weil es ja in wahrheit wie man an der mirna sieht ein fantastisches erlebnis ist das ist einfach toll und w re auch f r mich cool gewesen aber langfristig denke ich eher ich h tte nie den weltmeistertitel in manchester gegen eine medaille hier eingetauscht
4829355 er hat sehr sehr hnlich reagiert wir haben dar ber gesprochen dass es eine sehr hnliche situation war der klare unterschied hier war dass es hier kein n chstes rennen gibt weil eine weltmeisterschaft kommt ja gleich wieder aber olympische spiele f r mich vielleicht nie wieder
4829356 es ist tats chlich das erste mal so dass bei olympischen spielen deutlich mehr als zehn prozent von den schwimmern bestzeiten schwimmen normalerweise ist es so dass knapp zehn prozent sich verbessern das ist das erste mal dass die spiele deutlich schneller sind als die weltmeisterschaften im jahr davor in athen war es so dass die siegerzeiten viel langsamer waren als bei der wm anm barcelona 2003 hier k nnen sich eigentlich fast alle steigern aber das kann ich mir nicht erkl ren
4829357 es gibt wahrscheinlich tausend gr nde aber ich kann jetzt nicht 24 stunden nach dem rennen sagen das ist im training schiefgelaufen das w re unfair es ist sicher nicht ganz zufall dass wir beide unsere ziele nicht erreicht haben aber es ist auch keine zwingende korrelation
4829358 es ist sicher mein sportlicher traum den ich mir nie erf llen werde dass das leben noch viel sch nere sachen zu bieten hat dass ist ja ganz klar
4829359 ich glaube ich werde nie dar ber froh sein was mich ungl cklich macht ist dass ich es im entscheidenden moment nicht konnte wie ich in ein paar jahren dar ber denken werde kann ich jetzt nicht sagen nat rlich haben viele vor mir auch nicht gold gemacht da bin ich in keiner schlechten gesellschaft
4829360 das wei ich nicht ich werde mal die analyse machen und das dann sehen
4829361 ja aber ich hatte ja nie so eine perfekte niederlage so eine niederlage mit fliegenden fahnen habe ich noch nie erlebt fr her war die antwort immer reinspringen und h rter trainieren und dann zwingst du dich praktisch dazu
4829362 die frage auf die ich am liebsten eine antwort h tte w re woher kommt diese leere sowohl physisch auf den letzten metern als auch emotional nach dem rennen
4829363 es ist nicht so eine klare trauer wie ich sie gerne h tte es ist nicht so dass es eine simple trauer ist es ist leerer als traurig es ist mehr leere als trauer weil es berraschend ist trauer ist ja da erwartest du etwas und dann kannst du dich voller emotion der trauer hingeben bei mir ist es so ich habe es ja nicht erwartet ich habe wirklich gedacht im schlimmsten fall hole ich bronze da w re ich heute gl cklich dr ber ber den schlimmsten fall dass es sozusagen noch besser kommt damit habe ich mich nie befasst
4829364 ich habe ja jetzt einen fantastischen filter ich muss mir um schulterklopfer nie wieder sorgen machen also unglaublich ich werde nie wieder probleme mit falschen freunden haben und da habe ich gemerkt die schwimmer sind eigentlich so cool wie ich gedacht habe jeder versteht das ist ein wettkampf da kann alles passieren am ende des tages gewinnt man genauso oft wie man verliert
4829365 nein erstens hat er ja klar gewonnen zweitens w re ich ja nicht weiter geschwommen dann h tte ich vor vier jahren alles erreicht was ich erreichen wollte und h tte keinen antrieb gehabt es ist ja unglaublich schwer die kilometer zu schwimmen man muss ja auf irgendetwas hinarbeiten und wenn ich schon vor vier jahren olympiasieger gewesen w re h tte ich die lust nicht mehr
4829366 das ist beeindruckend mich w rde interessieren wieviel du daf r noch aufgeben musst um so weit zu kommen ob man irgendwo eine ganz ehrliche rechnung machen kann dass man sagt okay das gebe ich daf r her damit ich das gewinne und ob er das aktiv gemacht hat oder ob er sozusagen da reingefallen ist
4829367 ich habe schon gemerkt dass ich es nicht mehr so richtig steuern kann nach manchester habe ich ja gemerkt dass es nicht gut ist zu sagen dass ich in peking sicher gold gewinnen werde aber das hat nicht funktioniert das hat niemand so gro geschrieben da war immer die rede als ob ich tats chlich vor drei tagen noch gesagt h tte ich hole sicher gold da habe ich gemerkt ich habe keine kontrolle mehr ich kann sagen was ich will jeder schreibt ich will gold
4829368 ich wei nicht wann ich das n chste mal ins wasser gehe und schwimme es ist sicher denkbar dass ich eine pause mache aber f r die wm in rom anm juli 2009 m sste ich sp testens im j nner mit dem training anfangen wenn ich die wm schwimme kann ich mir maximal eine auszeit von drei monaten nehmen
4829369 ich habe es versucht aber ich habe gemerkt dass ich was suche das ich dann machen will da h nge ich mich dran deswegen habe ich dann alle m glichen variationen wieder zur ckgeschraubt da brauche ich einfach meine zeit um eine wirklich ernsthafte analyse zu machen
4829370 das h ngt davon ab wie leicht oder schwer es ist fl ge zu bekommen ich bin ja froh dass ich im herbst den flugschein mache beim fliegen habe ich dann nie probleme
4829371 ich h tte gerne etwas aber das w re ein versteckspiel wenn ich jetzt sofort eine n chste aufgabe h tte k nnte ich mich viel leichter verstecken genau das w re ja auch eine bronze medaille eine bronze medaille w re ja f r mich das perfekte versteck gewesen
4829372 collectives are mere accumulations of individuals their problems are also accumulations of individual problems they are only solved by a general change of attitude and the change does not begin with propaganda and mass meetings or with violence it begins with a change in individuals it will continue as a transformation of their personal likes and dislikes of their outlook on life and of their values and only the accumulation of such individual changes will produce a collective solution

4829375 northland scored their two tries from wide out to a brilliant winger who we would love to see here obviously hes a genuine superstar
4829376 chris is clearly a player who can provide good field position for you hes got a left boot so that gives you a foil to the halfbacks right boot he made some good decisions in the second half to get us down there into northland territory
4829377 we wanted to attack them more this week we still wanted to play territory but in the first half they shut us down quite well when i came on i knew we needed to plug the corners and that was my direction
4829378 the medals were an inspiration and showed a lot of courage and it was precisely that which won the game for us that togetherness as a team
4829379 we stuck to the task at hand and showed our skills and it paid off in the end
4829380 it was a hell of a physical match and the defensive attitude of the guys really paid off in the end they way we gang tackled the boks and forced the turnovers we worked hard for them and that set the standard for the game we really targeted the start
4829381 they were at our line a couple of times and we also missed a few shots at goal but some days it is like that we really scrambled hard on defence and we knew we had to stop them defence sets the attitude for the game and those gang tackles slowed down their ball it was all about attitude
4829382 dan played superbly in the last 20 and he has learnt to handle pressure situations like this he is one of those players that has the guys to hang in there and do the business and finish
4829383 we are very disappointed at the way we played but there was so much emotion surrounding percy montgomery this week and his 100th cap that perhaps it got to us in the first 20 minutes and it took us that long to get back into the game
4829384 we didnt do a lot of things wrong but we made simple mistakes at crucial times and we allowed the all blacks to come into the game again
4829385 its no use crying over spilt milk but we will be back again these guys are professionals and they will pick themselves up again we will have our fights behind the scenes to pick the guys up if you look at the dressing room you look at the faces and the guys know they can do better
4829386 after the marriage youve got to have the horse and carriage
4829387 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4829388 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4829389 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4829390 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4829391 mama daddy said i have to fill in the blank

4829418 individuation corresponds to the appearance of stages in the being which are the stages of the being it is not a mere isolated consequence arising as a by product of becoming but this very process itself as it unfolds it can be understood only by taking into account this initial supersaturation of the being at first homogeneous and static sans devenir then soon after adopting a certain structure and becoming and in so doing bringing about the emergence of both individual and milieu following a course devenir in which preliminary tensions are resolved but also preserved in the shape of the ensuing structure in a certain sense it could be said that the sole principle by which we can be guided is that of the conservation of being through becoming

4829483 i was fortunate to be able to escape from the hospital and make it up the the minneapolis art institute last sunday for last day of alecs sleeping show as well as the friedlander retrospective if ever there were two shows that speak so directly to format and personal vision its those two shows both were fucking brilliant lets just get that straight right away alecs huge beautiful prints just tempt you to walk into them they are lush and colorful and made me feel like i was sitting outside reality while the real world resided on the walls his photos are imposing they demand respect but with a whisper friedlanders work is exhausting like his retrospective book from his moma show the shear volume of the work was impossible for me to digest i witnessed things in photos that ive never seen before in images that ive studied countless times his prints are smallish both his 35mm work and medium format but his detail is frightening he finds and constructs depth of layers in his images that boggles my mind as i walked back and forth between the two shows i couldnt help but think about their process the acute focus of alecs view camera revealed planes of focus that are unseen in his book and the space he captures and manipulates is so deliberate and poetic you can feel the slowness of his process in his portraits especially friedlander is just out there ripping along like a tornado it seems devouring the landscape and reveling in his mobility and catlike reflexes much of his work is all about movement and timing thats not to say they are not careful images exactly the opposite but in so much of his work there is a feeling of a constant state of motion alec and friedlander have both carved out very distinct styles and they utilize different tools to the same end they exploit the strengths of their chosen mediums and are deftly effective it would be impossible for either alec or friedlander to duplicate what theyve done with the others medium neither is inferior and neither medium reigns supreme just different tools used to the best of their ability by two genius photographers

4829543 when it is the night of the middle of shabaan spend that night in prayer and fast that day
4829544 one hundred rakahs in the middle of shabaan reciting soorat al ikhaas ten times in each this is mawdoo fabricated and all its narrators in its three isnaads are majhool unknown and daeef weak he said and twelve rakahs reciting al ikhlaas thirty times in each this is mawdoo and fourteen rakahs this is mawdoo a group of fuqahaa were deceived by this hadeeth such as the author of al ihyaa and others as were some of the mufassireen the prayer of this night the middle of shabaan was described in different ways all of which are false and fabricated
4829545 the hadeeth about the prayer during the night of the middle of shabaan is fabricated and is falsely attributed to the messenger of allaah peace and blessings of allaah be upon him
4829546 the prayer that is known as salaat which is twelve rakahs between maghrib and ishaa on the night of the first friday in rajab and the prayer of laylat al nusf min shabaan of one hundred rakahs these two prayers are reprehensible bidahs no one should be deceived by the fact that they are mentioned in the books qoot al quloob and ihyaa uloom al deen or by the hadeeth which is mentioned in these two books all of that is false nor should they be deceived by the fact that some of the imaams were confused about this matter and wrote a few pages stating that these prayers are mustahabb for they were mistaken in that
4829547 nothing firm and reliable has been established on the authority of the prophet peace and blessings be upon him that he held night vigil prayer and fasted during the day of the 15th of sha ban

4829552 it was just so great to see him continue to become his own person
4829553 the whole process of parenting is to help them take those steps away from you
4829554 its not like you disappear and the person that you were that you are doesnt exist anymore when you become a mother
4829555 i want them to be interested in their own lives and their own accomplishments
4829556 i dont want them to be interested in mine mine are of no consequence to them i am their mother
4829557 it was just so great to see him continue to become his own person

4829566 the biggest thing is the way weve orchestrated it were getting a lot of young guys getting chances to play
4829567 the other thing is this is a totally different offensive scheme and defensive scheme than weve seen so we get to see how well they make those kind of adjustments in a short period of time we didnt spend a lot of time working on st louis so well see who can handle those types of things
4829568 anytime you play games there should be dramatic improvement from week one to week two
4829569 so im looking for our young players if they had a problem last time around to improve on that

4829756 nascar made the move to the new car to further improve two key elements of the sport driver safety and competition and they have done an outstanding job
4829757 whenever there is change there is always a transition period with some issues or obstacles i am a huge supporter of this car and have already found the car to be more exciting and competitive than the old car
4829758 my concern is that they did have an open test at las vegas and still had a record number of cautions including three serious crashes involving former cup champions
4829759 we only have had a two car goodyear test so we could see a lot of crashes and that causes me concern im sure the teams would like as much data and track time as possible to reach that comfort level with the car and its performance at our speedway
4829760 i think texas will be the toughest track we go to with this car and its already a tough race track
4829761 and when you look at the transitions the vertical loads the bumps and the speeds its probably going to be closer to this track vegas than to any other track we go to and well try to go with all that we know well try to engineer and do the science and the math and everything and try to figure out how much travel were going to get and the loads that were going to get based on past experience and being there the biggest challenge were going to have with the impala going forward this year is going to tracks that we havent tested at and been to and gotten the data and the laps with the telemetry
4829762 i think there are a lot of challenges at texas maybe more so than here vegas texas is a little rougher
4829763 with this car the bumps seem to be a pretty major issue so i think texas is going to be quite a challenge with this car some teams are going to hit and some teams arent the success we were able to do there last year none of that works none of that information will be worth a hoot so its starting all over again
4829764 data is data if youve got any at all its a good thing
4829765 would we have been better off going someplace else for an open test maybe texas or something yeah maybe
4829766 the key to our sport is taking the time that you have to do anything that you are doing and doing it efficiently if you have an hour practice you have to use that hour of practice better than your competition and the teams that can do that are the teams that continually have success being efficient with your time is really important thats going to be like 2that all year with this car well its like that with every car but i think its going to be even more important because were trying to learn so much in a short time
4829767 i had pretty good grades and i want to further my study in whatever
4829768 but why would i have to take a test like this when i proved i can do college level work by graduating from a 4 year institution
4829769 we didnt show who we are going to be on either side of the ball
4829770 we kept it simple we pulled our punches on defense today
4829771 well have to go look at the film ill dont want to vent my opinion live without looking at the film
4829772 for me or the line as an offensive line it was pretty good there are some things we still need to work on for me i dont believe it was good enough today ive got to go back to the drawing board and back to the basics
4829773 i felt like i did good weve gone through 15 straight practices so i thought my legs were a little sore there were some good plays and some bad but well get back out there monday and fix it up we have been thudding a lot and after we woke up it went pretty good
4829774 i try to make contact let the opponents know that im there everyone is jelling together the offense came out real strong today
4829775 its kind of difficult i play both at wheel linebacker but i like being inside thats where the hitting is
4829776 did a good job but he dropped the ball we know he is a good player hes just young i was pleased with ward the other back jamie hatten caught a bunch of balls defensive end vinny curry flashed a couple of times brandon burns flashed one or two times delvin johnson and brandon bullock flashed a couple of times
4829777 i thought a couple of the tackles did a good job today because albert mcclellan went over there today
4829778 it was a thud hit those are some of the things rick minter and i have discussed and know we are going to have to live with
4829779 we are going to go in and talk about it
4829780 it will be a typical thursday afternoon practice this afternoon lots of special teams on sides kick hands team coming out about five p m
4829781 it will be all quarterback club members in the prime seating
4829782 and there will be an opportunity to become a quarterback club member or buy a ticket for our raffle
4829783 quarterback and tackle those are the two most competitive position battles right now because youve seen we are going to play a lot of people on defense they are going to play whether a starter or not on defense like receiver the biggest battle is the tackle position
4829784 ive been pleasantly surprised it will be a big scrimmage for mark and brian and those tackles well be a little bit vanilla play a lot of younger guys and be smart with our older guys theres your surprise ive already made that decision but they the staff dont know it yet
4829785 hopefully they the officials will bring someone to run the clock with them its the new rule but i dont know who it is

4829898 the labor movement is on th frontlines in the fight for better pay and working conditions that benefit all workers by setting an industry standard
4829899 i think member to member phone banking and labor walks are the most important tactic for our local our members and their families appreciate the time we take to talk with them face to face on an individual basis

4829903 weve got news for not the department of management its the department of labor and were here to take it back but we cannot do this alone we need your help because change doesnt happen from the top down it comes from the bottom up
4829904 its not just that this administration hasnt been fighting for you theyve actually tried to stop you from fighting for yourselves
4829905 with workers under attack on a daily basis in this country now more than ever is a time we need to stand together to elect barack obama as president of the united states our jobs and our childrens livelihood is at stake
4829906 this call is an opportunity for labor leaders and their members to hear directly from barack obama about the importance of the afl cio labor 2008 program during this election our members are working diligently across the country to support candidates who will join us in our fight for the employee free choice act affordable health care and a host of other issues that are crucial for working families senator obama will address those efforts as well as stress the need to continue to do what we do best during this election cycle which is reaching out and educating our members in a successful effort to turn out the union vote for worker friendly candidates
4829907 i find that labor walks are most effective because that personal door to door union member to union member contact not only engages the person were contacting but gets our walk volunteers all fired up and exciting about participating in the election process many times the when you go to another union members house theyll thank you for all the hard work youre doing and that is gratifying
4829908 i think it is just getting the word out to members regarding where the candidates stand on the issues and if their stance on issues is worker friendly or not
4829909 we need to reach out and educate our members to let them know how important it is to back candidates that support working families and the issues that are important in their everyday lives
4829910 our pensions have been devalued and healthcare is in big trouble in a country as great as ours health care should be available to all we still have over forty four million people in this country without health care and that is unacceptable
4829911 with workers under attack on a daily basis in this country now more than ever is a time we need to stand together to elect barack obama as president of the united states our jobs and our childrens livelihood is at stake
4829912 this call is an opportunity for labor leaders and their members to hear directly from barack obama about the importance of the afl cio labor 2008 program during this election our members are working diligently across the country to support candidates who will join us in our fight for the employee free choice act affordable health care and a host of other issues that are crucial for working families
4829913 early participation of labor leaders and members through out the state as we strategize with the barack obama campaign lays the foundation for a successful missouri campaign communication and planning are the keys to success
4829914 i think labor walks are important because it is union members talking to other union members about why it is important to vote for worker friendly candidates like jay nixon and barack obama
4829915 labor walks are important to remind our members of the need to elect worker friendly candidates
4829916 labor walks are essential because they allow union members to get out and speak with other union members its been shown time and time again through research that when we get out and talk with one another it actually has an effect on workers think and vote
4829917 i think it is important for us to get out and talk about the issues affecting union members and their families
4829918 if every local union adopts the labor 2008 campaign plan i am confident we can win in november
4829919 the issues at stake in the 2008 elections impact all working americans skyrocketing job loss health care costs and gas prices plus the decimation of pensions and worker safety protections
4829920 we can win these elections by mobilizing union members to vote in their best interests we cannot afford to let anyone sit these elections out
4829921 that is one thing that people need to know about the labor movement we are a large group of skilled workers that go through the extensive training needed to get the job done and done right
4829922 we let them know just how important this election is not only for our union but to their families and to their friends and neighbors we are always pressing because this election is probably the most important one for the labor movement in a long time
4829923 i think that barack obama has his heart in the right place and he will help the american people out and put a respectable healthcare plan into place
4829924 our goal is to get as many green credits as possible for smmpa
