3880034 film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3880035 i thought it was hilarous the reason that it works comedically is because the characters are incredibly stupid so instead of making fun of the mentally challenged its not an insult to the mentally challenged it actually lifts them up because it shows how ignorant people really are if you have any respect for those characters then it would be completely insulting hes trying to insult actors you know who should be insulted actors they should call the actors union
3880036 the toughest thing i have ever had to do in baseball
3880037 dutrows recent remarks about curlin inspired me to offer to get these two great horses to race at the spa jackson said
3880038 imagine curlin against big brown on a legendary track it would be thoroughbred racing at its very best and in the name of a great cause
3880039 the day of the woodward were challenging them on the basketball court at saratoga
3880040 itll be three on three me rick and kent desormeaux against jackson steve asmussen and robby albarado

3880042 i have no personal issues with jess jackson iavarone said
3880043 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3880044 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3880045 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3880046 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3880047 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3880048 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3880049 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3880050 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
3880051 i think we can defend it yes i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa ever that the united states has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding
3880052 this is not a recolonisation as some of our critics say or another anglo iraqi treaty of the 1930s that will bind iraq
3880053 have managed to make some compromises on all the sticky issues or problematic areas of any sofa which are universal jurisdiction detention powers of authorisation to launch military operations issues of sovereignty
3880054 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11 there could be drawdowns
3880055 the idea is really to keep these forces outside the main cities the population centres it doesnt mean that they could not enter or come through
3880056 saw a series of video and social networking sites exhibit much more modest traffic growth than they had been
3880057 you really shouldnt be climbing this many stairs with your bad knees
3880058 the companys going to have to start the process ofregaining confidence of investors before its credit spreads aregoing to be able to return to historic norms
3880059 its trading way wide even wide for its rating now and itdefinitely doesnt look like investors are willing to give aigthe premium that it used to command
3880060 the company is not i think in a dire situation where itneeds capital but when it can opportunistically access themarket i would expect to see it again
3880061 if earnings do not stabilize by the third quarter then adowngrade of one notch is likely
3880062 failure to address these concerns in the near term couldlead to rating downgrades at the parent company dlirs and orother operating units
3880063 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3880064 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3880065 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3880066 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3880067 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3880068 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3880069 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
3880070 addison did only live three days in this world but because of this she lives on
3880071 i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of america and to the for which it stands one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all
3880072 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3880073 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup
3880074 freaky flash take 2 was annoying me which meant it was probably pissing off everyone else i looked around for a way to allow the viewer to turn it on and off by himself and found a css technique over at
3880075 thats the gillman rule school officials everywhere should memorize it
3880076 i hold the orthodox christian view that marriage is the union of one man and one woman for life and this is the god ordained place for sexual relations
3880077 these scholars are excellent additions to an already outstanding business faculty
3880078 if barack obama is at a democratic convention and he talks about inclusion of lgbt americans you could call it preaching to the choir
3880079 but when he goes into african american churches and says the same thing you couldnt call that preaching to the choir
3880080 the big difference is the food concepts theyre bringing to the food court
3880081 were giving students a variety of low to moderate cost choices
3880082 well just be opening the new places in phases we hope to have everything finished by the time the spring semester starts in january
3880083 were looking forward to a great catering relationship with chartwells and the university to provide the food and drinks for all kinds of events from cookies and coffee to upscale dinners and events
3880084 as coordinator i make every effort to increase awareness of volunteerism and to get the students involved in civic engagement
3880085 when i see the numbers of students involved the wide range of community organizations that have been helped and the total number of service hours completed by our students in saluki volunteer corps it is simply awesome
3880086 i am also proud of our students involved in land of lincoln americorps
3880087 it is a big commitment to take a full course load of classes and tutor and mentor children for more than 20 hours each week the americorps members complete 900 hours of service in a year they demonstrate their commitment to making a difference every day
3880088 okay so on the way home we suggested drunkenly that his birthday would have been complete had we invited you home with us with 8 happy years under our belts heh
3880089 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
3880090 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
3880091 while there were no onex acquisitions in the second quarter our focus on certain industries is beginning to surface attractive opportunities
3880092 the current credit environment is not deterring us from actively seeking those unique opportunities to acquire great businesses
3880093 my dad told me there is one thing mccains are good at and that is not giving into pressure and honor keeping our honor regardless of what happens
3880094 my marriage ended because john mccain didnt want to be 40 he wanted to be 25 you know that happens it just does
3880095 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3880096 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3880097 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3880098 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3880099 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3880100 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3880101 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3880102 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3880103 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3880104 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3880105 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3880106 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3880107 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3880108 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3880109 we urge the fbi to be transparent about the reasons to obtain the records with such urgency and secrecy
3880110 we urged the bureau to refrain from using similar procedures in the future improper monitoring of reporters is harmful to a free press and undermines the free flow of information
3880111 we kind of respected it because the process hadnt been moving
3880112 its very tragic that this issue of torture has besmirched the military
3880113 the way this argument has been framed post 9 11 is that this enemy is so unique so callous so depraved so impervious to regular interrogation techniques that we have to take the gloves off
3880114 revenge will be visited upon us for what weve done
3880115 they will take years to get revenge and they will get it
3880116 i dont know how it will be visited upon us but it is coming
3880117 this is an issue that is nonpartisan if there ever was one
3880118 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3880119 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3880120 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3880121 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3880122 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3880123 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3880124 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper
3880125 the strategic assets of countries with oil are becoming more and more important
3880126 now putin wants to show the west that he also can show the west its limits
3880127 lautner imagined dozens of his octagonal houses scattered across the santa monica mountains each in its own self contained world enveloped in glass
3880128 it felt a little wrong to me that the award went to somebody who writes mainstream literary fiction that merely borrows a few tropes from sf
3880129 our efforts in the first half of the year position virgin mobile to rapidly improve our growth trends
3880130 the operational improvements we have put into place are beginning to pay off while net revenues declined year over year due to general economic conditions and their resultant impact on consumer budgets the benefits of our low fixed cost model are reflected in our strong profitability and record free cash flow of 29 2 million
3880131 short fiction on its way out or a way to break into the market

3880133 the golf scramble has grown each year and were excited to expand to a second course this year
3880134 its not only a lot of fun we raise awareness and much needed funds for united way of greater battle creek
3880135 we cannot thank kellogg enough for all the amazing work they do around their united way campaign
3880136 they have an amazing group of volunteers who coordinate everything from this golf scramble to a bowling tournament and motorcycle rally to name just a few
3880137 corporate will be taxed at rate of 11 percent compared to 18 percent to qualify firm would require to contribute 8 percent of payroll to a pension plan earmark 2 percent of its payroll to employee training program pay at least half of employee medical insurance and have a profit sharing or employee stock ownership plan the ceo could earn no more than 50 times the rate of the lowest paid employee there responsibility should be to provide their employee safe working environment good health benefits good training and adequate retirement plan
3880138 the confluence of forces that is shaping the field of social enterprise
3880139 respect for the blackhawks organization is at an all time high theyve done everything right and made themselves competitive enough to excite people
3880140 parece que est o dispostos a usar qualquer bomba que fabriquem quer porque tal decorre da sua ideologia quer porque receiam um ataque preventivo de israel logo um ataque de israel que impe a os iranianos de darem os passos finais para obterem a bomba prov vel a alternativa deixar que teer o consiga a bomba tanto num caso como noutro o holocausto nuclear no m dio oriente est em jogo
3880141 a man doesnt learn to understand anything unless he loves it
3880142 you dont think of it in terms of whats the cost of the individual helicopter
3880143 you think of it as what do we need to do to protect the president
3880144 and we cant figure out where that number comes from its a myth and its becoming a legend
3880145 by the inability of people in the region and around the world to really know what ties together the capabilities that chinas acquiring with the intentions it has
3880146 is a serious distortion of facts and attempts to interfere in chinas internal affairs
3880147 this requires a major perhaps even a revolutionary change in the way the u s government approaches and resources conflict response
3880148 we must focus our energies beyond the guns and steel of the military
3880149 based on my experience serving seven presidents as a former director of
3880150 we are proposing shifts across our civilian agencies that will bring all elements of national power to bear in the defense of americas vital interests
3880151 protecci n y soluciones duraderas en los flujos migratorios mixtos
3880152 being physical in pass protection were catching too much were absorbing
3880153 thats the most difficult thing about being a pass protector
3880154 baby or bath water must we ditch traditional structures to do church well
3880155 42 percent of total nitrogen used during the period was attributed to production of corn
3880156 we dont believe that federal employees should be used as bargaining chips in this process and the fact is that the department is forcing these furloughs when they could be pushing them further out into the year
3880157 everything that the members raised are things that we have looked at
3880158 we are taking these measures because we believe there are no other measures to take
3880159 if you send a signal to prospective federal employees that theyre going to sort of dangle on a string or be used on the front line in battles over the budget it becomes very difficult to recruit good people
3880160 merely showing that a technology works and is cost effective and placing the results in a report has not been sufficient
3880161 the administration projects a plan showing the base budget declining and theres good reason to believe that there will be a lot of pressure to restrain spending it will be left to the next administration how to sort this out if theyre going to abide by it they will have to start scaling back plans or will have to add more money
3880162 i have always loved and respected vintage home accessories my grandmother has fabulous taste and i admire her style and ability to actually use antique items on a daily basis to this day we still drink out of the pink wine glasses she inherited from my great grandparents
3880163 antique items bring a sense of personality and interest to your home unlike any other new accessory can
3880164 bottom line you wont find them in other peoples homes they are uniquely yours it may sound creepy to others but i always wonder who owned the item before me why did they buy it what was going on at the time
3880165 living in los angeles and my work in interior design definitely inspired me to look at objects in new ways
3880166 i am really into brass animals right now i cant explain it mid century barware and any unique serving piece nothing could be more fun than entertaining your friends and serving them a cocktail out of mid century glassware but there is so much out there it is sometimes hard to edit for every thing i buy i have passed about 99 pieces of junk so i only buy what i like since moving from los angeles to the northeast i have found myself addicted to the flea markets here its really become a hobby so why not turn it into something productive plus there is no way i could possibly keep everything that i purchase
3880167 coming from california i am not used to such detailed architecture i thought the drawing would be fun as the logo it is a symbol of home and a representation of where i now live
3880168 nu r det din tur att vara med mig jag kan inte f lja efter dig mer
3880169 he did state that when he looked down and saw the vehicle pull up that the person appeared to be yelling or waiving something to that effect then he heard gunshots
3880170 right now we dont believe robbery or any type of theft was the motive
3880171 to pay a man or a woman to come over here put the vest on every day and escort military and civilians around the theater knowing that people want to blow them up and kill them you gotta pay to get that level of dedication
3880172 quite frankly they are very extensive very lucrative contracts why would they not try to protest them
3880173 were in the wake of this speedboat we cant even catch up to the contracts
3880174 are immense and probably shocking to a lot of people but they represent just two companies within one sector
3880175 were talking tip of the iceberg stuff here thats pretty disturbing when you begin to extrapolate it out
3880176 our men and women on the front lines should not be caught in the middle of partisan disagreements in washington d c
3880177 i often hear that war critics oppose my decisions but still support the troops well ill take them at their word and this is the chance to show it
3880178 for the cost of less than 40 days in iraq we could provide health care coverage to 10 million children for an entire year
3880179 he repeatedly says no to health care no to law enforcement no to homeland security no to stronger infrastructure
3880180 but he says yes to this intractable civil war in iraq which is being paid for by borrowed money
3880181 there have been reported cases of fraud waste and abuse of contracting operations with many of the worst cases originating out of kuwait
3880182 we have seen more cases lately and thats cause for concern
3880183 make sure that weve identified anything that needs to be looked at that hasnt been already been picked up by an ongoing investigation
3880184 we already know from our internal looks over the last few months in kuwait that the experience level of some of the people not all of the people that we had in kuwait wasnt up to the challenge or the complexity of the contracts
3880185 even if you turned off the spending spigot tomorrow defense companies would still have great cash flows for many years to come
3880186 where this time last year those contracts were not generating much in revenue revenue is flowing now
3880187 illustrates how gd is benefiting from booming demand for army and marine corps equipment
3880188 im a little bit concerned about us keeping our expeditionary flavor
3880189 can i give a satisfactory answer to what were going to be doing with those things in five or 10 years probably not
3880190 wrap them in shrink wrap and put them in asphalt somewhere is about the best thing that we can describe at this point and as expensive as they are that is probably not a good use of the taxpayers money
3880191 anyone who thinks that this is not a serious situation is simply misinformed or is ignoring the facts
3880192 this is an old budget showdown tactic and theyre using federal employees livelihoods as leverage in a turf battle with congress
3880193 reconsider plans to lay off civilian employees in the midst of this political debate the defense department should have alternatives for funding the war without laying off civilian employees one alternative is to request authority from congress to reprogram operation funds
3880194 they are the ones who care for wounded war fighters in dod hospitals and they are the ones who tend to the families of troops waiting at home for their loved ones
3880195 the need for furloughs farther into the next calendar year by which time supplemental funds may be enacted
3880196 ik heb het gevoel dat ik ga openbarsten als een ei
3880197 stop het gaat niet goed ik maak me zorgen en ik heb daar reden toe
3880198 du r allt som r och allt som r gott
3880199 het verbaast me dat jullie die doorgesnoven cokehoer van een micky hoogendijk niet noemen
3880200 de makers van dat programma zijn net zo debiel als de mensen die in dat huis zitten
3880201 we think that if we do this at the beginning of the school year that we can ensure the most appropriate behavior and support our student achievement mission
3880202 i thought it was very helpful and we need to be reminded of a lot of things that we have forgotten over the years
3880203 there are some lines youve got to draw as with any position professional courtesy and things like that
3880204 a lot of it is common sense but with the technology age and things changing you need that stuff reiterated
3880205 there are lots of really positive ways to use this type of technology that helps our students with their studies but there is also the danger that there could be some inappropriate communication
3880206 charities should be investing their money in an ethically or socially responsible way
3880207 pelosi is committed to her global warming fanaticism to the point where she has said that shes just trying to save the planet
3880208 we all know that someone did that over 2 000 years ago they saved the planet we didnt need nancy pelosi to do that
3880209 i am particularly troubled that the decision to disseminate this fabricated intelligence is alleged to have come from the highest reaches of the administration
3880210 the administrations attempt to challenge mr suskinds reporting appears to have been effectively dismissed by the publication of the authors interview recordings and transcripts i have instructed my staff to conduct a careful review of mr suskinds allegations and the role played by senior administration officials in this matter
3880211 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
3880212 im real disappointed in the direction that american airlines is going with this
3880213 it appears today that kansas city is going to take the biggest hit
3880214 den roligaste som f r b de jobb och relation att fungera
3880215 the arranging banks described the response as satisfactory given difficult loan market conditions although the first phase of selldown narrowly missed targets
3880216 whats different about immigration today as opposed to a century ago is not the immigrants but us america is now a mature society and that renders our past experience with immigration irrelevant we have a post industrial knowledge based economy a welfare state advanced communications and transportation technology that complicate the issues of security and sovereignty etc we have in other words outgrown mass immigration it was an important phase of our national development and played an important part in shaping who we are as a nation but like other phases weve passed through as a people pioneers settling the frontier for instance its something we need to put behind us

3880221 este subsidio que el gobierno envi como proyecto de ley va en directo beneficio de las personas al permitir que la gente pague menos en su pasaje o en algunos lugares se mantenga y no suba

3880229 the results appear to open the door to heart transplantation after cardiac death
3880230 there are a significant number of kids who have congenital heart disease or develop disease of the heart muscle that prevent them from surviving and their only chance is a heart transplant
3880231 the worst age for donation is in those under one not because there are not a large number of children who die at this age
3880232 so many of these children are not offered the option
3880233 the heart is the most vulnerable organ and it needs to work at its optimum right after transplantation
3880234 the feeling from the entire team was that we should shorten this as we may have jeopardized the recipient
3880235 the outcomes after transplantation of hearts from donors who died from cardiac causes were similar to those associated with traditional organ donation
3880236 all three recipients survived despite being at high risk for death
3880237 discussion is healthy there are a number of angles that are taken that are relatively extreme and thats excellent as the discussion should be full and uninhibited and these are rational people with differing opinions the whole thing should be done as transparently as possible my hope is that this leads to more opportunities for transplantation
3880238 is that you have to have a donor and a recipient at about the same time
3880239 for pediatric heart donation and transplantation involving patients who die from cardiocirculatory causes to become a more frequent option for end of life care and to affect significantly the nationwide risk of dying while waiting the concept of distant sharing of donated organs from these donors should be considered
3880240 but lots of patients get better without pci so it doesnt mean we shouldnt do pci it means that people will not be put at additional risk if pci is deferred to see whether they get better with just medical therapy
3880241 the most remarkable observation from courage is the stellar performance of optimal medical therapy which not only affected hard outcomes but more impressively affected outcomes for which pci clearly was thought to have an advantage which is relief of angina and ischemia
3880242 while the difference in health status and anginal frequency in courage is unequivocally significant in favor of pci plus omt it is likely too small to be judged as being clinically important
3880243 if omt is just as good and doesnt have the drawbacks of being invasive and associated with some periprocedural complications and added cost then it stands to reason that the initial treatment strategy should then be optimal medical therapy failing which pci can be considered
3880244 the health status advantages associated with pci persisted for six to 24 months however although the benefits were significant the comparative differences were small leaving open the question of whether a pci first strategy is justified
3880245 a very reasonable take home message from the courage trial is to pursue optimal medical therapy initially and if this is ineffective turn to pci
3880246 clearly shows the symptomatic benefit and the quality of life benefit for pci and i think thats what the interventional community has been saying all along i think that actually its a positive trial from that perspective i think it reaffirms that patients with more frequent and more severe angina do better with pci than those with little or no angina i think thats always been the case and i dont think any of us have suggested otherwise
3880247 or when there was objective evidence of worsening ischemia on noninvasive testing at the discretion of the patients physician
3880248 a remarkable finding from the courage study was the rapidity of improvement in health status in both treatment groups this should serve as encouraging news to patients with coronary disease
3880249 with contemporary treatment the majority of patients had substantial improvements in health status that were sustained for several years at the same time the rapid improvement with optimal medical therapy alone suggests that antianginal medications are underused in practice
3880250 scores were higher in the pci group than in the medical therapy group for six to 24 months depending on the domain by 36 months the addition of pci to optimal medical therapy no longer provided a significant advantage for any domain
3880251 but for two years or more the pci patients felt better had fewer symptoms and had a better quality of life
3880252 im amazed pci as performed in this trial maintained superiority through two years because of the extremely high frequency of bare metal stents high frequency of standard balloon angioplasty and the incomplete revascularization in the pci cohort
3880253 think of what could have been achieved if more complete pci had been performed with optimal technology that is with drug eluting stents you would have had a more durable benefit of pci
3880254 the level of medication and even the goals achieved as far as blood pressure control cholesterol levels etc were truly remarkable in this trial its admirable i think its inspirational but its unrealistic
3880255 patients with objective evidence of ischemia absolutely if feasible should have pci plus omt unless there are mitigating circumstances
3880256 these data contribute to my enthusiasm for doing pci better than was done in this trial
3880257 still giving optimal medications to the extent that theyre tolerated and the patients are compliant i have no doubt that a strategy of complete revascularization with optimal technologies would provide a significantly greater gap than was demonstrated to two years in this trial and would extend that benefit beyond two years
3880258 its not unreasonable to think that the separation between the two groups would be wider and it would be maintained for a longer period of time
3880259 if on objective assessment you demonstrate a substantial degree of myocardial ischemia in association with reduced lv systolic function that would be a case where i could justify an initial pci strategy
3880260 i would say high risk anatomy and a high risk functional stress test a large amount of myocardial ischemia and compromised lv function those would be reasons why i would offer pci over medical therapy only
3880261 the courage trial redefines the contemporary roles of optimal medical therapy and pci in the management of patients with stable angina rather than one victor courage demonstrates that both treatment strategies can have a profoundly positive effect on patients health status and suggests complementary roles optimal medical therapy as first line therapy with pci reserved for patients who do not have a response or who have severe baseline symptoms

3880317 i have really enjoyed the summer so far from a personal point of view

3880319 on top of that you have all the guys in county cricket and simon jones coming back its all healthy and keeps you on your toes
3880320 so im not sure if i think i belong there in the team but if i can keep putting in the performances and keep taking wickets and if i can do as much as i can to impress the selectors they wont be able to leave me out
3880321 consistency is something i have been striving for and the confidence i have got from my consistency and the wickets ive taken this summer has been great
3880322 the one thing that has pleased me more than anything is the way i have kept my speeds up as i have bowled quite a lot of overs this summer
3880323 i have not been used to bowling this many overs in a summer so keeping my speeds up in the mid eighties and sometimes a bit more is encouraging

3880383 we continue to make progress the repositioning of our auto finance business to a focus on company initiated finance contracts is delivering encouraging results the recent sale of our check cashing business will allow us to focus on our core activities as we look ahead to fiscal 2009 we will continue to build on our recent progress and see total revenue for the year exceeding 25 million and we are forecasting after tax earnings from continuing operations in the range of 35 to 45 per share
3880384 our results continue to be negatively impacted by economic weakness in north america and europe as well as by escalating raw material and fuel costs we continue to aggressively raise selling prices to offset the cost increases while we have had some success in achieving price increases they have not been sufficient to offset the increased costs as such we have announced additional selling price increases for the third quarter of over 20 for north america and over 10 for the european market in these times of unprecedented raw material and fuel cost inflation we are striving to realize the full amount of the third quarter price increases with minimal lag in order to restore our margins in addition we are committed to further price increases to offset the impact of additional commodity cost inflation as well as recover the significant cost increases absorbed in the first half of this year
3880385 in addition to aggressively increasing selling prices we are driving significant productivity and cost reduction initiatives during the second quarter we implemented a company wide restructuring program which is in addition to the overhead reduction initiatives which we implemented at the end of last year and the first quarter of this year the restructuring program is well underway and we will begin to see the impact from the program in the second half of this year our quarters results reflect 2 6 million of pre tax severance charges related to these programs and we expect to incur additional pre tax severance charges of approximately 2 1 million over the remainder of 2008 we expect these programs to generate annual savings in excess of 20 million

3880650 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3880651 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3880652 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3880653 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3880654 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
3880655 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3880656 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3880657 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3880658 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3880659 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3880660 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3880661 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3880662 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3880663 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3880664 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3880665 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3880666 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3880667 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3880668 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3880669 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3880670 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3880671 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3880672 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3880673 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3880674 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3880675 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench

3880678 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3880679 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression

3880695 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer

3880708 this meal the lords supper is not some magical mystery medicine we take to exempt ourselves from the hard facts of life in the world it is a way of confronting those hard facts no prayers of a tv evangelist no prayer cloth from arizona no holy oil or water no holy food no technique for self betterment no sincere social program exempts us from this death
3880709 but at the table with cup in hand even our most painful times are redeemed because this savior saves through suffering
3880710 no you can say that our god has been there before our god does not flinch in the face of evil in a hurting world where injustice still sends good ones to the cross we do have something to preach we like paul before us boldly lift up the cup and daringly preach christ and him crucified if we would follow this lord we must follow him down this narrow way of passion

3880730 weve had a long standing mystery in this house because of a cat many years ago the cat who belonged to my grandmother alice made off with her pearl necklace no one has ever found where the cat hid it
3880731 i was told that the week before grandmother alices death she laid her pearls near the edge of her open desk when her cat stretched out a paw to investigate them they rolled off the desk and twisted around the cats neck the cat was terrified and dashed from the room
3880732 fortunately the maid caught the cat rescued the pearls and returned them to my grandmother alice wore them to a party the night before she died but that was the last anyone saw of the pearls
3880733 there was no one else who could have taken them
3880734 after all the cat had been frightened by the pearls it may have wanted to get rid of them
3880735 when i moved into the house 10 years ago the cat was living here grandmother and mother always seemed to have a cat around
3880736 lets hunt for the pearls well do it in teams
3880737 theyve chosen sides for the treasure hunt since were not on their teams why dont we work together
3880738 come on the others have already gone up to the room where the pearls disappeared
3880739 im glad you didnt blame the cat the cat had nothing to do with the disappearance
3880740 this room was searched thoroughly at the time the pearls disappeared
3880741 why dont you try the places a cat might have taken them a cubbyhole in the kitchen perhaps or a dark corner of the basement
3880742 i want to show you where alice kept her jewelry
3880743 no one knew alice was very secretive she never told anyone where she hid her jewelry not even her relatives
3880744 a bracelet was found inside this drawer a silver pin set with garnets in that one and a gold locket in there
3880745 you dont know what a problem this was for the cat
3880746 look alice must have loved poetry here are volumes by dickinson wordsworth emerson longfellow and tennyson
3880747 dont worry i dont have any trouble seeing in the dark
3880748 i know you must be hungry weve got cocoa and ham salad egg salad and tuna salad sandwiches
3880749 sabrina come with me i think i know where we might find the pearls
3880750 after all these years of everyone blaming the cat now the truth will finally come out
3880751 you look so weird with your right arm stuck out in the air
3880752 they cant see you now and they couldnt when you changed into a girl could they
3880753 a ghost cat who took the form of a human in order to help solve a mystery

3880755 we tend to act as a restaurant would and add a 15 percent gratuity to parties of 10 or larger
3880756 otherwise clients are free to tip as they see fit usually they leave the tip at the front desk when paying their bill and the employees eventually see the tip money in their checks once taxes have been taken out
3880757 we did away with tipping about a year ago and offered our employees a raise in their pay to make up for the loss of wages that they would normally receive through tips the change didnt sit well with the employees and left the customers confused
3880758 we keep envelopes at the front desk for cash tips and each employee gets credit card tips in cash at the end of the day
3880759 we add a total gratuity of 18 percent onto each service
3880760 from the tip monies collected per employee there is a 3 percent administrative fee and 15 percent goes directly to the therapist we have never had any problems with employees not accepting the policy and guests love that they dont have to worry about tipping each individual
3880761 a tip is a monetary amount given to the employee by the patron and is theirs to keep if the tip is placed on a credit card the tip must be paid back in full no later than the next regular payday
3880762 while standard taxes may be taken out of the tip monies returned in a paycheck credit card processing fees and administrative fees may not be deducted
3880763 tips are not to be collected and divided pooled re directed or in any way given to any recipient other than the individual that the patron intended the tip be given to
3880764 if the business applies a fee to a service even if they refer to it as a gratuity the money is no longer considered a tip
3880765 this money although collected in theory to replace an individual or cash tip is now the property of the business as such the business does not have to give the employee any of it
3880766 the proper procedure for filing a claim against an employer for tip related complaints is to contact your local department of labor and wage standards office if they determine that you have a claim your employer may be fined
3880767 this type of document will serve as a basis of fact when presented in court or during a labor dispute if examined by a local governmental office or if a civil complaint is filed
3880768 the employer is prohibited by law to in any way penalize the employee bringing the complaint by federal law
3880769 if an employer is in any way threatening or harassing an employee because of a wage or tip dispute they could face an additional fine

3880777 dass wir davon ausgehen d rfen dass die hom opathen sich nach ber zweihundert jahren der praktischen verifizierung insbesondere im bereich der h ufig verwendenden arzneimittel aus einem von fehler bereinigten und durch die praktische erfahrung erg nztes soliden arzneimittelfundus bedienen
3880778 dies wird von dem medizinhistoriker prof robert j tte als die erste doppelblindstudie der medizingeschichte betrachtet das ergebnis war f r die hom opathie negativ das bedeutet es konnte keine spezifische wirkung in dem versuch extrahiert werden jedoch standen ein gro er teil der teilnehmer der hom opathie negativ gegen ber so dass von dieser seite von einem bias auszugehen ist
3880779 im jahre 1997 teilte mir ein kollege mit dass er im rahmen einer hom opathieausbildung eine placebokontrollierte hamp mit einer wohl bekannten hom opathischen arznei durchgef hrt hatte dabei tauchten verumsymptome in der placebogruppe auf
3880780 somit scheint es diskrete hinweise daf r zu geben dass eine placebokontrollierte hamp nicht zu dem gew nschten erfolg f hren kann placebosymptome von spezifischen arzneiwirkungen zu isolieren analog der generalisierten quantentheorie kann es zum auftauchen von verumsymptomen in der placebogruppe kommen
3880781 auf alle f lle gibt es nach dem aktuellen erkenntnisstand keine konkreten hinweise f r die annahme nicht placebokontrollierte hom opathische arzneimittelpr fungen als nicht valide f r die hom opathische praxis zu betrachten
3880782 the other day i was cranking sacred love is there any song more stirring than the book of my life in my car and i pulled up to red traffic signal the guys in the car next to me started laughing amongst themselves i just looked straight ahead paying them no mind but then the guy in the passenger side says something like nice tunes dude the light turned green before i could respond aaaarrgh i was pissed and i wished i had a perfect zinger to put them in their place maybe they were jealous im cruising in a jaguar s type and these dirtbags were driving around in some kind of filthy piece of garbage playing their c rap music
3880783 i read a lot of carl jungs psychological essays and was very intrigued by him in fact i used to go and meet with one of his pupils who was called the baroness vonderheit and she used to try and analyse my dreams and of course i couldnt remember my dreams and so i would make them up shed look at me quizzically and are you sure you dreamed that i was trying to please her i suppose

3880835 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3880836 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
3880837 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3880838 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
3880839 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
3880840 the review by dr simkhovich and his fellow authors make it quite clear that air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease
3880841 they suggest that this is another compelling reason to campaign for improved air quality while at the same time studying therapies to minimize the risk of exposures
3880842 the poor who sell their organs are being exploited whether by richer people within their own countries or by transplant tourists from abroad
3880843 the legacy of transplantation must not be the impoverished victims of organ trafficking and transplant tourism but rather a celebration of the gift of health by one individual to another
3880844 the declaration of istanbul on organ trafficking and transplant tourism
3880845 from this point of view we would treat the news as very positive
3880846 the main thing is that the assets are not merely interesting but also produce a synergy for the whole group
3880847 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
3880848 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
3880849 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
3880850 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
3880851 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
3880852 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
3880853 antibodies with dual reactivity to plasminogen and complementary pr3 in pr3 anca vasculitis
3880854 id love to if i can find the right movie
3880855 actually i have a part that just came up were just trying to work it out with my schedule with the children

3880857 one brisk january evening nanette and i were enjoying a romantic ride in a hansom cab through new yorks central park as we rounded a brightly lit bend the cabby stopped and announced there she is wollman rink the next day i returned to the newly restored ice rink and was delighted with the bustle and noise of dozens of skaters dipping and gliding on the ice a light snow all but obscured the silhouette of the famous plaza hotel i decided to paint a nostalgic view of this winter scene
3880858 well shit if ive come this far without them without it i dont need anybody

3880864 a gunman barged into the arkansas democratic party headquarters wednesday and shot the state party chairman three times critically wounding him authorities and party officials said
3880865 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3880866 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3880867 when you dont see people its almost impossible to know whats going on inside someone elses house
3880868 to me a gas leak outside of a house doesnt typically happen
3880869 my parents were both writers and my grandfathers were both writers of a kind both newspaper men my father wrote for television and films and my mother who is still alive is still producing lots of books it meant that we would all watch things on tv and analyze them and tear them apart which is good schooling it was also good to see that it was possible to get away with writing and make a living from it
3880870 i did nothing i would really say amounted to anything
3880871 i was worried i would end up trying to repeat it i tried doing something that went down a blind alley working on a novel for a while for which i did a lot of research but finding it was a bad idea then i started on the short stories which was about as opposite to a historical novel as you can get i was very keen on not writing historical fiction
3880872 for some insane reason my parents had hung onto my old school books from that time so i looked at those and the writing was helpful
3880873 that was one of the challenges to make it not too cute
3880874 i am very interested in going back to the historical but much further back than the victorians but still in rome i tend to do the research first and then see what seems interesting and where it might go
3880875 these days i tend to read non fiction that might throw up an idea i find i am getting more interested in things that are more diverse from science to history to geology i tend to get lead on by some idea that seems interesting something i have always wanted to know about and read a lot about it even so that if it does not go anywhere it feels satisfying
3880876 silva feels he is important here whatever the options he may have he wants to remain with us and we want to thank him for that
3880877 we should adopt a reconciliatory rather than confrontational approach to bring about stability in the country
3880878 pakistan needs stability to deal with the serious issues of terrorism and a deteriorating economy the country is passing through the most difficult period of its history
3880879 we think it is an unconstitutional move and we chose to abstain from the proceedings
3880880 this is another victory for pakistans ruling coalition and democracy
3880881 lifestyle weight management is thrilled to present the 10 week weight loss challenge which will promote weight loss and health in the area while at the same time raising awareness and funds for the american diabetes association

3880895 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3880896 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3880897 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

3880902 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

3880929 illustrate the high standards set by noblesville schools and the strong student performance that results
3880930 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3880931 all the contestants are convinced that maestro can help to de mystify classical music and remove some of the elitist aura that surrounds it
3880932 is an un kickable drug habit and im happy to be a junkie till the end of my days
3880933 he doesnt read music you know hes doing it all on instinct
3880934 people can change they just need to be introduced to new things im 42 i never used to like green olives but i love them now that can apply to all tastes people shouldnt sneer about classical music there are only two types of music good music and bad music
3880935 my friends are saying to me i cant believe that youre doing this and i simply reply dont knock it till youve tried it
3880936 you dont question music its a sensory overload and its mind blowing to be at the centre of it as you crank up the strings you unleash this exceptional power you think i cant have anything to do with that sound but you do all you have to do is gently cajole the orchestra do you mind awfully being great for me and bam its there
3880937 i get very frustrated with the way music is often sidelined its one thing that can link everyone across divides of politics age race and sex
3880938 classical music is not alienating its inclusive and just because you listen to one form of music it doesnt mean you cant listen to any others its like picknmix sweets sometimes you fancy a cola bottle and sometimes you fancy a pineapple cube i like a bit of brahms but i also like a bit of the chemical brothers you need the full arsenal of mood shaping aural sensations at your disposal
3880939 it would be great for the show if some enormous gold toothed beefy black sex pot like goldie won it
3880940 classical music is exciting to watch and to listen to and it can touch you in ways that no other art form can
3880941 the brain responses showed that when a pianist plays a piece with emotional expression the piece is actually perceived as meaningful by listeners
3880942 high testosterone exposure during gestation promotes development of the right side of the brain where musical ability resides and high foetal testosterone levels produce men who are healthier more athletic and have a higher sperm count in other words men who make lots of music make lots of sperm
3880943 this is wonderful people can listen to music any time they want to
3880944 im not so sure its a good thing they can also listen to music any time they dont want to
3880945 por falta de un centavo no puede acabalarse un peso
3880946 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3880947 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3880948 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3880949 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3880950 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3880951 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3880952 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3880953 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3880954 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3880955 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3880956 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3880957 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3880958 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3880959 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3880960 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3880961 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3880962 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3880963 an integration of a number of components from a variety of different sources
3880964 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3880965 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3880966 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3880967 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3880968 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3880969 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3880970 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3880971 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3880972 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3880973 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3880974 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3880975 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3880976 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3880977 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3880978 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3880979 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3880980 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3880981 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3880982 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3880983 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3880984 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3880985 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3880986 we believe that this price represents a significant value for heelys stockholders and acceptance of this proposal is in the best interests of heelys and its stockholders
3880987 adding the dark tone to the stellar series line reinforces omnimounts dedication to providing the consumer with an abundance of choices and shows commitment to a line that has had tremendous success
3880988 integrators are always looking for another subsystem to go into homes and with the market slowing down now integrators have a little more time to add on to their profit center
3880989 there are only so many customers but because there is nothing out there like the vroom it gives dealers a reason to call past customers to get them excited about it and get into the homes it will open up a whole new category to customers and integrators who are already familiar with the dirt devil lines
3880990 the we know what you do guarantee is an example of how avad continually looks for new ways to support our dealers
3880991 we know how difficult it is when a product fails within the first 30 days so we have decided to replace it with a new one this takes the product liability away from the dealer so they can make their client happy with the least amount of hassle the second piece of our guarantee supports our customers in a different way if circumstances on a job change and an avad dealer finds himself with an un opened product he no longer needs we will take it back for full credit with no re stocking fees we understand the nature of the custom installation business and are fully committed to providing our dealers with the tools and policies they need to get the job done cost effectively and efficiently
3880992 our upgraded line of universal controllers further emphasizes rtis commitment to providing the most extensive line of control solutions which are designed specifically for professional integrators and their clients

3881000 im thinkin i ate out too that is such a rare thing that i was freaked out by it i didnt enjoy it i wasnt feeling satisfied i felt disgusted with myself i hated me even more i was in a panic
3881001 i suppose youre just getting the small fries right mom
3881002 plain right and get a double theyre cheaper and extra cheese you like that cause it drowns out the meat taste remember
3881003 and this morning i had a small breakfast just a bowl of cheerios and i ran out of cheerios after about two cups i usually eat 3 or 4 add the fact that i worked my butt off at the gym after i got off work and i had a ton of calories left over when i got home well over 1000
3881004 so i figured what the heck i deserve it ive been craving it and avoiding it im gonna treat myself to my favorite food
3881005 when i was done and put the meal into my food log i was relieved that
3881006 only ate 700 between when i woke up and 5pm
3881007 so i figured what the heck i deserve it ive been craving it
3881008 thats just like god isnt it always letting me know hes there even through a tiny moth
3881009 i love you i died for you im here for you
3881010 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3881011 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3881012 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3881013 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3881014 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3881015 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3881016 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3881017 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3881018 i dont suffer from insanity i enjoy every minute of it
3881019 of all the things ive lost its my mind i miss the most

3881024 ik heb dunne banden dus op dat fietspad moet ik uitkijken dat mijn wiel niet tussen die kieren komt vertelt ruud van der klei die er dagelijks fietst
3881025 als ik op de fiets ga neem ik altijd de andere kant van de a12 dat fietspad met die losse tegels is echt waardeloos
3881026 dat nieuwe fietspad moet er aan het eind van het jaar komen
3881027 ik fiets elke dag van zoetermeer naar delft en mooier dan dit kun je het niet hebben
3881028 ik vind het echt een schande ze hebben dat fietspad gewoon dichtgekwakt
3881029 normaal ging ik altijd over het nootdorpsepad nu moet ik door een woonwijk de fietspaden zijn verder goed maar die woonwijk is niet ideaal
3881030 tussen delft en pijnacker fietst het lekker alleen in de binnenstad van delft is het wat krapper maar daar ontkom je toch niet aan
3881031 in de stad zelf vind ik het nog wel eens lastig co rdineren dat moet na september over zijn dan moet de zoefroute bekendheid krijgen door borden en aanduidingen op de weg
3881032 met panelen boven de weg kunnen we de automobilist duidelijk maken dat er een milieuvriendelijk en gezond alternatief is dat misschien nog wel sneller is ook

3881039 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3881040 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3881041 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3881042 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3881043 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3881044 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

3881051 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3881052 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3881053 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3881054 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3881055 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3881056 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3881062 even during the court hearings he was always accompanied by his wife to court there have been instances when the court was about to issue warrants against him for non appearance in court but a lenient approach was taken considering his age and medical background
3881063 but we also wanted to try him for additional charges of an approver turning hostile

3881083 the mccain campaign has been trying to tear him obama down at every opportunity and they keep on zeroing in on this idea of celebrity lets take a quick look at the latest ad from the mccain campaign that hammers obama on that point
3881084 your grandfather of course was very famous for his three pillars of national security address your enemies provide economic security moral authority as well do you believe that senator obama has the same type of experience to be able to carry on those three pillars of national security
3881085 are you confident that senator obama can measure up to that sort of experience that youve had historically in your family
3881086 these documents were originally created for yc funded startups to use when raising angel rounds they seem to have worked well in trial runs so far so were open sourcing them
3881087 while they may not be suitable for all situations the goal was to make the terms fairly neutral so while we would of course advise both parties using these documents to have their lawyers look at them they provide a starting point that we hope can be used in many situations without too many modifications
3881088 this will help them access timely care and live better lives this is the first step in breaking down the financial barriers in accessing treatment for plhiv
3881089 before the operation is conducted the female decoy will have to give a written declaration that she is doing it for humanity and in public interest and helping the competent authority voluntarily without any prejudice
3881090 volunteer lawyers are a vital part of the delivery system for legal services to low income and disadvantaged people in wisconsin we are constantly looking for ways to support volunteers when they make the commitment to provide pro bono legal services
3881091 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3881092 lost boys was a massive part of my life it still is
3881093 you cant crap on that and im not going to go out and do a cameo in a dvd release sequel why they never talked to joel schumacher in the past 15 years about doing a proper sequel if youre not going to embrace what youre coming from in its original state look it was hard enough for me to do young guns 2 which i ended up thinking because we were all better was a better film
3881094 its amazing because theyve been such a big influence ever since we grew up
3881095 its kind of too good to be true i was like a little giddy kid at christmas when i heard that we got to do this tour
3881096 daltry and townshend they dont actually interact much because theyve been there and done that so they kind of get driven to the stage they do their show and they kind of get driven away
3881097 were used to doing little pub shows running in trying to get sound ready but this was really easy we got treated super nice
3881098 were usually not even used to getting anything in a dressing room well get a bit of water and maybe a case of beer it was a little nice to be pampered a bit with good food and it was kind of out of the ordinary
3881099 right now everyones a little frustrated in the music industry
3881100 theres been so much change and everyones just trying to keep their head above water
3881101 with sales and how all the labels have changed and how all the rules have changed and i think its just that much harder to get an album out these days on a major label
3881102 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3881103 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3881104 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3881105 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3881106 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3881107 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3881108 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper
3881109 the strategic assets of countries with oil are becoming more and more important
3881110 now putin wants to show the west that he also can show the west its limits
3881111 we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3881112 they were productive positive and we look forward to a very near term release of the final rfp
3881113 we were not even given the courtesy of a phone call
3881114 we recognize that this is going to cost the county if you are not correct several million dollars plus at least a two year delay in getting a new system
3881115 we will continue to use the system we have in place

3881125 its unfair that people keep saying the chinese are too young to compete if they think they can tell someones age just by looking at them well if you look at the foreign athletes they have so much more muscles than the chinese they are so strong do you then say that they are doping
3881126 if you were injured bela didnt want to see it
3881127 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me
3881128 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
3881129 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3881130 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3881131 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art i want the best for him i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to
3881132 they spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or hear some new thing
3881133 may we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak
3881134 god is an idiotic deity and that there is no such thing as evil
3881135 for 2000 years we have been called sinful creatures we are equal with god or jesus
3881136 sin does not exist do not make the mistake of clinging to the old rugged cross
3881137 the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god
3881138 im from a place where one does not end a sentence with a preposition
3881139 you can argue that it was the highlight of his career he had been treading water for eight or 10 years
3881140 he said he was fearful of doing television because aside from the ed sullivan exposure television had been a fiasco for him
3881141 wed start shooting at nine or 10 in the morning and go until we were done then hed go into his living quarters and invite friends and theyd jam to all hours of the morning
3881142 i was amazed by all the energy enthusiasm and fun going on after a hard days work
3881143 there was no plan at all i mean absolutely nothing
3881144 he didnt know what he was going to do i knew he was going to pull out some of the old songs wed done that kind of thing but that was it
3881145 this is supposed to be like an informal section of the show where we faint or do whatever we want to do especially me
3881146 because he hadnt been touring he had gotten into the movie thing i know his feeling was im getting back before the public this way
3881147 weve hired the morette company as contractor and we have all the permitting in place
3881148 and its my understanding it will be the first of three hotels with a total of 485 rooms that they plan to build on their 26 acre site
3881149 the color schemes and furnishings will be very different from anything at pensacola beach every season the color schemes will change in the hotel
3881150 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3881151 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3881152 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3881153 we believe that the 47 1 percent we requested is needed if we are able to stand behind our promises
3881154 focus on the greatest moments in rock history and will resonate with everyone from the casual music fan to the seasoned rock enthusiast
3881155 we are very excited about the introduction of the mrp 64 as a great example of our clear focus to develop revolutionary new control solutions for the professional integrator
3881156 with the mrp 64 and rkm 1 consumers benefit from the flexibility of being able to bi directionally control almost any multi zone receiver or distributed audio system together these products provide users with a superior control system and a great solution for distributing audio at a terrific value
3881157 there is definitely a difference in the volume and shape of jennifer aniston
3881158 as a botanist i feel it is my duty to eat as many species as possible
3881159 were kinda busy right now how does next tuesday around 2 pm work for you
3881160 became question marks in both chapters 2 and 3 of new dawn making it so every time they talk it looks like this hey annoying right
3881161 legal epistemology is ninety per cent quantitative the other half is qualitative
3881162 nuclearization of energy sources thorium based nuclear energy promsing what uranium never delivered
3881163 despite an extensive search we couldnt find a child who was flawless enough to sing our glorious anthem to the world
3881164 it would be insulting both to our guests and to our magnificent nation to have even the slightest imperfections in the child so we just used a cardboard cutout and digitally animated it for the tv audience we considered digitally creating the vocal piece as well but the technology just isnt there yet
3881165 i didnt quite get why that cardboard cutout was being paraded around on a string
3881166 wait so youre telling me that cute little cardboard thingy was fake
3881167 they digitally created a cardboard girl man oh man that was some clever stuff it really looked like real cardboard
3881168 using digital animation in place of humans is commonplace in cinema but it has also been used in the sporting world too lets not forget the time bill belichick fielded a holographic tom brady during preseason to protect him from injury the chinese see things like that and latch on to them
3881169 china is always going to look to us for their cues and take it a step further we pump our athletes full of steroids they follow suit we have little leaguers lying about their ages they have a whole gymnastic team lying about their ages we pollute our environment they drown their country in smog digital animation is simply the next logical step in their attempts to emulate the west
3881170 does nobody else think that a 7 5 chinese guy is a little fishy
3881171 many children die in childrens hospitals each day after withdrawal of futile care
3881172 although 400 pediatric cardiac transplantations are performed successfully each year 100 in infants under the age of one year as many as 50 infants yearly are placed on the waiting list but die while waiting infants have 10 times the risk adults have of dying while waiting for an organ
3881173 this recommendation was based on the longest reported period before autoresuscitation of a child or adult 60 seconds
3881174 what minimum duration of asystole ensures that autoresuscitation will not occur is an empirical question that can be answered conclusively only after observing many hundreds of patients
3881175 i predict that when prudent boundaries are created they will exclude death determinations at 75 seconds of asystole
3881176 anyone who had had a cardiac arrest lasting beyond the time at which autoresuscitation was possible would be legally deceased even if the heart had been successfully restarted through external stimulation
3881177 there have been persistent questions about whether patients with massive brain injury apnea and loss of brain stem reflexes are really dead
3881178 whether death occurs as a result of ventilator withdrawal or organ procurement the ethically relevant precondition is valid consent by the patient or surrogate
3881179 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death
3881180 to foster discussion of donation after cardiocirculatory death in general and its application to infant heart transplantation in particular
3881181 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead
3881182 before the trial was begun an extensive period of education discussion and preparation was undertaken within our hospital and in programs already using donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes
3881183 after each transplantation involving these donors there was extensive institutional debriefing and review by the ethics committee and the data and safety monitoring board
3881184 this study was performed in the context of a large pediatric transplant program yet most potential donors who underwent withdrawal from life support could not be considered because there was no compatible local recipient
3881185 you dont sleep at all the night before the students return
3881186 were looking for a new beginning with new faces and new challenges
3881187 were going to have the department of education here the first day of school
3881188 our biggest challenge is helping children understand that they didnt fail
3881189 youre going to be spending a whole lot of time here besides your work day thats the first thing i tell them youre going to have to plan to stay late and take things home
3881190 i take the manual home every night and study it
3881191 legal epistemology is ninety per cent quantitative the other half is qualitative
3881192 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3881193 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3881194 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3881195 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3881196 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3881197 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3881198 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3881199 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3881200 we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3881201 it speaks volumes that the purveyors of woo are so resistant to testing their ideas and to acknowledging the mountainous evidence against them
3881202 i hate to give the woo babies any ammunition but nobody has yet mentioned snake anti venom
3881203 i hate to give the woo babies any ammunition but nobody has yet mentioned snake anti venom
3881204 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3881205 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3881206 weve had discussions with multiple companies in russia and hopefully well see some light at the end of the tunnel here by the end of the year
3881207 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3881208 at this stage theres no formal discussions going on but there was an inquiry
3881209 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3881210 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3881211 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3881212 theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3881213 by rule we have to pull her off until after the election is over
3881214 according to the equal time rule its whenever its considered to be two candidates in the race thats when the equal time begins
3881215 the radio show is going to help the people who are interested will get to know what im about theyll see my take on the issues and it will open doors for me it just will and i think people will begin to take the race more seriously
3881216 it will be a call in show and i will absolutely talk about my campaign they said thats ok
3881217 ill talk about where to donate where to pick up signs and if you want to ask a tough question youll be able to do that too
3881218 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
3881219 white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush tahir jalil habbush the director of the mukhabarat to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
3881220 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq
3881221 i understand that there are some people who wish to bury any new facts concerning the subject of wmd in iraq they are ready to liquidate any person or group who ventures into this subject
3881222 are not ready to give interviews because that endangers their life it would endanger your life as well i am serious in my warning
3881223 nobody can guarantee your life nor the fate of the material you will be collecting in baghdad
3881224 i request that you adjourn your scheduled trip to baghdad
3881225 if you decide to continue with your intention then i am very sorry to tell you that taking the overall environment in my country i am not able to support your mission the main reason would be to preserve my life during or after it is concluded
3881226 i had made several important contacts in regards to your trip
3881227 as you know the situation inside iraq is very dangerous and confused and many people were hesitant to meet with you
3881228 they were afraid of what the americans might do if it was found out that they had met with you
3881229 they just disappeared into the shadows they are still very much a presence in baghdad and iraq
3881230 mr ritters life is at risk if he comes here as well as the life of any iraqi he meets with
3881231 if he does his life is at risk your life is at risk and everyone associated with his visits life will be at risk
3881232 i guess its just because you are who you are
3881233 george bush is in trouble our people did not find any wmd in iraq can you help us
3881234 can we prepare something for that we could bring in some nuclear material from the former soviet union and pretend they are iraqi
3881235 iraq confidential the untold story of the intelligence conspiracy to undermine the un and overthrow saddam hussein
3881236 target iran the truth about the white houses plans for regime change
3881237 probably not possible to get not for a single person
3881238 and the trilogy and the whole idea of focusing on the norse mythology and effects on technology we think is really going to turn peoples heads
3881239 tatty father in yiddish what will be when you are no longer with us in the flesh
3881240 it seems to me she was proposing a false dilemma either the kids are psychotic or theyre psychic
3881241 there is also a good part about over imaginative kids they do need a lot less time to play with them
3881242 when i was a tiny baby in your belly i was also afraid to sit on daddys motorcycle
3881243 it seems to me she was proposing a false dilemma either the kids are psychotic or theyre psychic but surely theres another possibility theyre just highly imaginative and perhaps over emotional due to stress in their lives
3881244 it seems most psychics find their belief in the paranormal around the same time most kids believe in santa and the easter bunny and when a lot of kids have an invisible friend and or hold regular lengthy conversations with their toys
3881245 now im not an expert on child psychology or anything
3881246 i think its our job to listen to the children and support them in really integrating their experience into their on going growth and development
3881247 looked for hidden bible code messages he wrote more on religion than he did on science he believed he was chosen by god to understand scripture in ways others couldnt

3881254 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
3881255 the ability to do a test from a spit rather than from a blood test really opens up this field to women who traditionally had not been eligible or had not had access to the services
3881256 when you have a child you want all the knowledge possible so that you can take whatever care you have to
3881257 the georgians figured it was better to ask forgiveness later but not ask for permission first
3881258 needs to be a part of resolving the problem and solving the problems and not contributing to it
3881259 we are also very grateful for your support for our peace plan for the conflicts and for your unwavering support for georgias territorial integrity
3881260 the meeting was set up in order to share information back and forth between us it was not set up as a meeting to come to any final decision
3881261 we certainly implied to wiseman and he agreed that this had to be a high level meeting
3881262 we have to have people present who have the authority to make some very definite decisions
3881263 i dont know if they were actually planning to move people
3881264 i think it was more to keep the general public from becoming upset at the fact that this could actually happen
3881265 they have to have a plan in place and the physicians have had offers

3881269 once they got acquired it seems like the sales staff just went away slowly but surely all the advertising campaigns went away
3881270 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc
3881271 were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
3881272 you know how the capital ships are invincible well that
3881273 although these findings seem surprising at first they hint at fears parents have about video games
3881274 to some parents video games are full of unknowable dangers of course parents dont want their children drinking alcohol but thats a more familiar risk

3881284 each song cash reeled off that day spoke his understanding of prison life dark as each song described confinement in some sense in a coal mine in love in poverty making clear to the men that they werent the only ones imprisoned and between songs he conversed with the men on their level grumbling about wardens and dishing out off color jokes
3881285 nothing brushed cash with darkness as broadly as at folsom prison
3881286 mostly due to its loud suggestion that cash had done hard time could any listener be blamed for thinking it hadnt he sounded devilishly conspiratorial with the men whom he entertained hadnt they cheered him like a brother didnt his voice sound gallows grave and the scar on his cheek look like a knife wound the grammy winning liner notes that cash wrote only fueled the myth i have been behind bars a few times wrote cash sometimes of my own volition sometimes involuntarily each time i felt the same feeling of kinship with my fellow prisoner for the rest of his years he uncomfortably lived with the myth knowing that hed conspired in its birth

3881290 and a few months before the shocking assassinations of luther king jr and robert f kennedy the albums performances and cash penned liner notes urged listeners to remember the caged men much like king shone the spotlight on disenfranchised blacks and the voiceless poor the album also tapped into the yearnings of late sixties music fans around the world who wanted from their music more viscosity more depth more reality more rebellion at folsom prison gave it to them songs performed with unrelenting passion a performer who would let nobody stand in his way and a look at a failing prison system

3881302 roleplaying a game in which participants control imaginary characters in imaginary situations and through the processes of play align their individual fantasies so that they are sufficiently coherent for the participants to interact as though they were experiencing a shared fantasy
3881303 the powerful continuity in role playing games is that things that are important to us will be repeated because we remember them and that things that are not important will be forgotten and lie easily contradicted by the wayside

3881329 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
3881330 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3881331 there is no cease fire they russian forces are moving around

3881364 we are ohana here sometimes we are slammed with guests from every corner of the world you know different customs and expectations and as you can see we have minimal space here its a delicate balance one time this lady who loves to cook came right into our kitchen she stood next to me peering into the pan surveying my process mark grumbled about safety and i politely escorted her out
3881365 i figured out that if you flip it it didnt burn so i flipped more frequently my dad and the guys were impressed can you imagine a seven year olds cooking surpassing their own back then i just used hawaiian salt and pepper but as i got older i started adding garlic
3881366 i was fourteen and it was the first time that i created a formal dinner for my family when my mother saw my chicken basking in rosemary sprigs i just love rosemary she complained loudly that there would be no tasting chicken just rosemary

3881369 i love fish one of the most overlooked fish is the delectable uku gray snapper i dont understand why people overlook this beauty i guess they see its grey skin next to the pink rosiness of ahi or the coveted opakapaka but anything can look gorgeous on a plate they just dont try hard enough besides the uku is delicious and the fishermen love it so this week i created a new special steamed uku in our wood fired oven seared with shallots and leeks truffle oil almond basmati rice and spicy macadamia nuts its a keeper

3881381 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it

3881388 esri china beijing along with esri teams in redlands california and many gis organizations and individuals are working diligently to support the rescue efforts headed by the cea and other agencies in the disaster area their work is important and has made a difference in the immediate rescue and relief efforts its going to continue to help in long term recovery with gis professionals working to rebuild communities and help people
3881389 gis gives you a very good visualization method to understand what is happening in real time
3881390 gis also provides tools to better analyze large volumes of complex data immediately following the earthquake we worked on a continuous basis with government agencies and others to offer assistance wherever we could we will continue to support the long term recovery the work being done with gis is helping to reduce the impact of this large complex disaster
3881391 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike

3881395 most of these came from dyer island and stoney point at bettys bay
3881396 the public thinks penguins get oiled only when there are massive oil spills but every year we deal with oiled birds
3881397 apart from oil there is over fishing and climate change which is affecting the migration of fish the penguins food source and they have to compete with seals for breeding grounds
3881398 at the end of the day this affects us because it shows that we are not looking after our oceans
3881399 you will always have those who dont obey the rules and even the rich countries cannot have 24 hour surveillance weve caught a few so far and if people are not going to heed the necessity of protecting the marine environment we will become very tough

3881404 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3881405 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3881406 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3881407 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3881408 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty

3881416 i thought poetry could change everything could change history and could humanize and i think that the illusion is very necessary to push poets to be involved and to believe but now i think that poetry changes only the poet
3881417 challenge to me because we write about the same place he wants to use the landscape and history for his own benefit based on my destroyed identity so we have a competition who is the owner of the language of this land who loves it more who writes it better
3881418 history laughs at both the victim and the aggressor the first teacher who taught me hebrew was a jew the first love affair in my life was with a jewish girl the first judge who sent me to prison was a jewish woman so from the beginning i didnt see jews as devils or angels but as human beings my poems take the side of love not war

3881443 when a player copycats a crime he or she sees in the game the game maker should be prosecuted

3881448 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
3881449 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
3881450 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
3881451 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
3881452 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
3881453 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care
3881454 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound
3881455 and cautions against the over reliance on current technological systems

3881458 the community has to be involved they see things when law enforcement may not ever see or hear about we have to have them involved so we know whats going on
3881459 the community is a part of the team and i like that concept and it creates another set of eyes out there for the sheriffs department
3881460 we believe we can curb the drug trade and make it uncomfortable for people to easily get drugs that it may curb some of the property crime s as well
3881461 it could be the economy it could be drugs it could be anything i really dont know we are a fast growing county and that being said im just glad that the sheriff is here and they work as hard as they do

3881464 bentley green is one of the most compelling individuals i have ever met even at the age of 7 i recently had the honor of spending a few days getting to know him and it was obvious to me is that his talent is only transcended by his intelligence and infectious personality he has an ability to own the stage like no child entertainer ive seen since michael jackson
3881465 we take our responsibility very seriously we want to introduce bentley to a world where he can excel as an artist at all levels without losing sight of the fact that he is a child
3881466 one of bentleys greatest gifts is his versatility he can dance circles around dancers years older rap alongside the elite of the hip hop industry and act as if he was born to the industry
3881467 in addition to entry into new high growth consumer product industries this acquisition will bring additional strong management allowing us to achieve the goals set forth in our shareholder communications
3881468 in addition to other be portfolio assets we are already on our way to introducing new innovative medical devices to the north american market as part of apii we will have the infrastructure that will expedite our sales and distribution for these products and product lines as an action company we will release our new products within action healthcare products
3881469 capitulation to dogma over the spirit of open inquiry leads to the very catastrophes that the unconscious proponents of dogmatism most fear thus we have the book burners of both left and right joined in common cause
3881470 fears of violating vaguely defined prohibitions are expected to lead researchers to choose safer topics of study and to censor their publications rather than risk lawsuits
3881471 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
3881472 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
3881473 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own

3881476 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
3881477 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
3881478 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
3881479 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
3881480 i could win a gold medal and people on the street would still ask me about lance

3881483 sales in the second quarter failed to show their normal seasonal improvement over the first quarter and were sharply below year earlier levels market conditions in our three key end markets manufactured housing new construction and residential remodeling are abysmal the weakest ive ever seen making matters worse we have not seen any of the softening of raw material prices that has accompanied downturns in the past instead costs for raw materials and energy have continued to rise rapidly
3881484 we have taken significant further action to try and mitigate the impact of the weak demand and high costs
3881485 while i do not anticipate the economic climate improving any time soon i am somewhat more optimistic about our own results particularly as we enter 2009 we have made securing additional business a high priority over the past year and i am pleased to report that these efforts have resulted in new programs that we expect will result in 12 million to 18 million of incremental sales next year this increased volume together with the full year impact of our recent cost reductions and price increases should help us get through the challenging environment we anticipate will continue into 2009
3881486 we were disappointed with the recent finding that the joint reorganization plan supported by all our creditor groups was found unconfirmable by the bankruptcy court however the official committee of bondholders the asbestos creditors committee and the future claimants representative have recently reached an agreement in principle which we believe resolves these issues and i expect a new plan will be filed within the next few months that we believe will comply with the courts prior decisions
3881487 we are very pleased with our operating performance this year
3881488 our effective sales and marketing programs our focus on strong resident relations and investments in the productive capacity of our property portfolio are enabling us to capitalize on the strengthening fundamentals in the canadian rental residential business
3881489 we are particularly pleased that coming off a very harsh winter with record cold temperatures in many of our markets our energy management initiatives continue to reduce our utilities cost as a percentage of revenues looking ahead we are confident our investments in energy saving initiatives combined with our proactive hedging programs will continue to control these costs and enhance our profitability
3881490 the outlook for the canadian residential rental business continues to improve demand continues to grow driven by the high cost of home ownership tightened availability for home purchase financing increased immigration and a rapidly growing seniors population that views rental accommodation as a cost effective choice with a strong balance sheet enhanced operating performance and a strong market presence as canadas landlord of choice we are well positioned to continue enhancing unitholder value over the long term
3881491 second quarter results continued the trend seen in quarter one all in line with prevailing capital market conditions none the less we remain convinced that we are building a solid and scalable financial services firm that is increasingly well positioned
3881492 by the nature of its business certain aspects of the corporations revenue will tend to rise and fall with financial markets but the corporation is now very well placed both to weather weaker periods and to capitalize quickly when conditions improve
3881493 es una verg enza que baleares salga en los peri dicos por c
3881494 we continued to capitalize on opportunities across western canada with a focus in the oil sands to deliver another quarter of strong growth
3881495 our impressive revenue performance was driven by high first quarter activity levels across all of our business segments although we encountered challenges on one of our oil sands mining projects our consolidated operations were significantly more profitable than a year ago we were also successful in recovering a portion of fiscal 2007 pipeline related losses
3881496 we are pleased with the continued growth and momentum we are achieving in our business
3881497 fiscal 2009 is off to an excellent start with all three of our business segments driving our growth
3881498 we are pursuing a diverse range of opportunities in all of our key markets and particularly in the oil sands where the scale of projects continues to grow our biggest challenge is ensuring we have the people and the equipment to respond we are continuing to build on our internal resources while also actively pursuing opportunities that either consolidate our position and reputation in the oil sands or contribute to diversification by securing opportunities in other resource industries
3881499 we expect our momentum will continue to build as the year progresses
3881500 we are now able to basically count the business rugged and semi rugged and rugged and umpc and even our mobile video all as one unit each one counts for one point and they can then sell all of those units and reach their goals much easier than it had been before
3881501 in this way we can recruit more partners who arent necessarily focused just on rugged into the program
3881502 it does help the smaller market partner to be able to sell the entire line without having to worry about the volume theyre going to sell
3881503 we make sure that they understand what verticals are best to sell in and how to sell to it and who their audience is sometimes its a different audience for a utility than health care for example
3881504 we want it to be more flexible i think this will help it and really allow us to put more focus on the non rugged products and to continue to make sure that the channel really knows our products are more than just the fully rugged models
3881505 as we expand our product line we want to expand our program to fit everyone as opposed to just some
3881506 i have ordered reinstatement with conditions to balance united group nzs concerns as to how reinstatement in the short term could be accommodated with mr edmunds arguable case that his dismissal was unjustified
3881507 i accept at face value mr edmunds expressed desire to return to work at united group nz and his concern about maintaining his reputation in the business community there is no evidence of financial hardship

3881526 during the past few years a major shift has occurred in the type of display that is considered the typical home
3881527 the role of metadata and process in the evolution of media
3881528 this is because of the commonly recognized importance of semantic metadata in effectively supporting various media related activities such as intelligent search and retrieval of media assets web
3881529 the impact of technology upon metadata collection costs courvoisier or cold duck
3881530 this paper focuses on the impact of technology on the cost of metadata
3881531 we compare these costs within representative media and entertainment workflows when using either traditional or modern file based technologies projections regarding the ongoing impact of technology upon metadata costs will also be examined
3881532 until best practices emerge this area will be subject to significant upheaval and innovation
3881533 is there room for standardization here will these technologies be applicable to other areas this papers purpose is to provide clarity to this important and evolving issue
3881534 service oriented architecture solutions have been used by it departments in banking and other fields for more than a decade

3881538 i think its more cheating than doping to look in the eye of everybody and to show up with a team underage my god its not good
3881539 i believe the officials will deal with it ill leave it at that
3881540 oh dr m m i see that on here but i dont have anything that shows that wed heard from her ill have to check and make sure we were able to get in contact with her can i call you back tomorrow and let you know

3881543 tibolone which is used around the world for menopausal symptoms decreases the risk of fractures decreases the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of stroke in this group of women who are all over the age of 60
3881544 for older women you should stop taking tibolone or not consider starting it
3881545 women who are having menopausal symptoms in their 50s can continue to take tibolone because it is relatively safe and also does have other benefits such as a reduction in the risk of fracture and breast cancer
3881546 it will not be available in the united states because the company is not asking the u s food and drug administration to approve it
3881547 all drugs that are being used for menopausal symptoms all have positives and negatives the task is to find drugs that dont have problems
3881548 for the u s consumer its sort of a moot point
3881549 it tibolone is not the magic bullet but i think its another drug that could potentially be used if it ever does get fda approval my caution would be that its potentially helpful but its not a slam dunk that its better than what we have been using
3881550 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3881551 air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3881552 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
3881553 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution

3881561 our fourth quarter results reflect both progress and continuing challenges
3881562 we had a good revenue quarter reaching the upper end of our guidance and recording the highest quarterly revenues in the history of our company but we believe the market continues to show signs of softness and so we have taken decisive restructuring actions to resize the company in both of our business groups to enable the sustainable profitability and cash flows that investors expect from our combined ip businesses these restructuring actions along with the restructuring of our debt facility accomplished in the fourth quarter will when completed reduce our quarterly spending by approximately 5 million the write down reflects current market realities but our belief in the long term growth and strategic value of the chipidea analog business remains strong
3881563 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round

3881565 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
3881566 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3881567 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3881568 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3881569 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3881570 higher pump prices and a slowing economy were undoubtedly factors

3881575 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
3881576 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
3881577 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing
3881578 i think its just hitting her what she is going through
3881579 if microsoft is so good at testing why does your software suck
3881580 it took him almost two months to secure the building permit and when the inspector did come out here and he did inspect the project nothing was built to code and the building inspector basically said it needs to be torn down and started over
3881581 obviously in order to sue someone and get a judgment the person has to be put on notice and have an opportunity to be heard but if somebody could just fly the coop so to speak and not be heard it would be unfair that a person with a valid claim could not pursue that claim in the courts
3881582 its my understanding ill never see my money back but had someone stepped up before me maybe i wouldnt be in this position i really want to stop him from scamming someone else
3881583 its like i imagine being a man its like being kicked in the nuts repeatedly thats how bad it feels you feel like you want to curl up and die
3881584 im trying to put it all in perspective immediately its not so easy but its just really tough you train so long and i feel like i disappointed myself my coach my family my country everybody
3881585 i wish none of you ever have to go through this feeling of loss and feeling of disappointment and the only thing that i can say is its definitely not going to kill me so it will have to make me stronger
3881586 my psychologist is going to kill me if he reads this
3881587 hes going to be like all that work we did and you cant accept your losses
3881588 i honestly didnt want to live after i lost in athens
3881589 i was like i am such a loser i dont deserve to live and now im just feeling like you know what i lost but i was well prepared i just didnt do what i had to do in the last three minutes
3881590 im going to keep it in perspective right now theres a war in georgia and people are dying and thats why this morning i felt so good coming in i just felt lucky im lucky that im alive first of all and lucky i can come and do my sport at the olympics it really sucks to lose its so painful but it doesnt make me more worthy or less worthy as a person its really just a match
3881591 it was just political everybody closes up before the olympic games i was just shut out of their system suddenly and unexpectedly and it was highly irritating
3881592 i thought i could fight through it and i did mentally i felt ready and i felt prepared and then i just sucked in the last three minutes what can i say
3881593 in the beginning it was positive emotion but it was too much
3881594 i tried to say please take it easy but its not easy to say hey dont fence so strong or so much take it easy
3881595 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best and i really did give everything i have
3881596 but i swear to all of you that i really did and im very sorry that i didnt bring home a medal but you train and you take your chances
3881597 nobody made me sign a contract that i would guarantee to win i just signed a contract that i would do my best and train my best and give it everything i can but im sorry unfortunately it wasnt enough today
3881598 the only real olympic hero is the individual adult male
3881599 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3881600 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3881601 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more

3881605 that machine is bigger than any one campaign and doesnt end after any one election so get involved and fight back with the truth
3881606 up and down the ticket and all across the country the rightwing smear machine is ramping up attacks on democrats
3881607 the republicans without ideas start running a negative campaign filled with personal attacks and misleading ads the attacks get condemned but they get lots of attention and get played on tv endlessly

3881619 its what anyone should have done but for us doing it i guess that makes us heroes to a point
3881620 this is something that just recently happened and oftentimes people tend to forget the acts the heroic acts of what an individual does what a civilian does and i just thought and captain coots thought this would be the time to do it

3881622 conservation is not just a response to drought its a tool for ensuring that well have the effective and efficient water use thats needed for future customers
3881623 the things that im worried about as the person in our office who monitors drought is the ground water and what impact the dry weather between may 1 and mid to late june had on the crops
3881624 i think were getting to the point locally where that long term deficit is not as important
3881625 this is historic over time as the economy tightens up libraries become more and more important to a community
3881626 todays opening was a huge success and a long time coming for us
3881627 we can finally come to a place to shop for everything and not drive 45 minutes
3881628 its my real sincere hope and belief that potsdam will become a destination for many people in outlying communities
3881629 we want to increase the traffic into the community to help out downtown businesses and to produce a greater foot pattern for the entire town and community
3881630 wal mart will be employing almost 400 people and thats a real boom to potsdam and neighboring communities
3881631 i go to suny potsdam and theres not really a lot to do so this gives us something to do 24 7

3881641 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3881642 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3881643 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3881644 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
3881645 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
3881646 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3881647 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3881648 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3881649 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3881650 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3881651 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

3881653 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

3881656 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3881657 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3881658 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3881659 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3881660 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3881661 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3881662 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3881663 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3881664 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3881665 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3881666 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3881667 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3881668 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3881669 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3881670 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3881671 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3881672 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3881673 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida

3881696 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
3881697 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space
3881698 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3881699 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3881700 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3881701 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3881702 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3881703 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3881704 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3881705 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3881706 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3881707 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3881708 no no no no too much dignity too much integrity to accept anything but the very best

3881716 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3881717 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3881718 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3881719 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3881720 this is likely to end in tears and poorly worded twitters
3881721 we have a productive active dialogue going on with our bondholders

3881725 the decision to have a tony bobblehead promotion was made back in february and march
3881726 when you think about the royals situation back then tony was coming off a very good year and was regarded around the league as one of the top defensive shortstops in baseball
3881727 individual championships trump team titles call me selfish but i would rather lay sole claim to a title rather than share the glory
3881728 come on is it so hard to come up with players to name these awards after and give them proper prestige
3881729 we do this basically for ourselves people appreciate it which is cool but i think they appreciate that were doing it for ourselves were doing it our way and how people like it is not up to us we like it

3881786 the georgians thought russian prime minister putin would not retaliate in the middle of the olympic games
3881787 we plan to deal with professional and serious companies from the security telecommunication anti virus and government industries thus we will not fulfil every single partys request for early access to our research material

3881809 many start up companies are boot strapped relying on personal savings bank card debt and other personal resources including sweat equity doing for themselves by the sweat of their brow what they might pay others to do if there were better first sources of outside investment capital
3881810 meeting with other entrepreneurs in your town who have previously raised money can be useful as they will know investors
3881811 unlike a bank where a small business goes to get a loan we dont care whether the client has poor personal credit is profitable is new or is growing fast

3881830 the third factor being the biotech general index has been fairly strong over the last six weeks or so
3881831 like mufgs initial proposal of 58 00 per share in cash the proposed tender offer of 63 00 per share in cash substantially undervalues unionbancal
3881832 the proposed price does not reflect the strength of unionbancals strong capital position the superior credit quality of its assets and its potential for profitable asset and core deposit growth in the current market environment

3881834 although we have had great success utilizing our massachusetts real estate attorney relationships for the past few years it is my belief that by conducting our business entirely in house we will be able to streamline our current operations so that everything from contract negotiations to the actual real estate settlement will be as smooth as possible
3881835 due to the complex and delicate nature of certain legal matters such as drafting wills probate administration and representing executors and other fiduciaries in estate matters our customers are looking for a firm they can trust and work closely with now that we can operate independently in massachusetts penner law firm will have complete accountability and our clients will be better served as a result

3881926 like millions of filipinos we want to watch the reunion concert but when we look for ways to get the tickets we are redirected to marlboro ph this is clearly tantamount to advertising
3881927 these adult registrants are and will become part of the tobacco companys database easily accessible to its other forms of advertisements through the electronic media
3881928 philip morris sought to gloss over any likely illegality which may arise from its sponsorship of the event by calling the reunion a promotional event not open to the general public but restricted to trade partners and adult smokers who have to obtain an invitation by registering in marlboros website
3881929 cigarette and tobacco companies from sponsoring any sport concert cultural or art event as well as individual and team athletes artists or performers where such sponsorship shall require or involve the advertisement or promotion of any cigarette or tobacco company
3881930 any visual and or audible message disseminated to the public about or on a particular product that promote and give publicity by words design images or any other means through electronic form of mass media
3881931 the manner by which pmi has utilized the electronic media to stir interest and create hype about this event lures both smokers and non smokers alike to its website with the expectation of obtaining an invitation thereby creating much publicity and getting electronic media mileage about marlboro its product name is nothing but plain and simple out and out advertisement

3881933 yes they broke the agreement but it doesnt count as copyright infringement because if they hadnt broken the agreement it wouldnt have been copyright infringement
3881934 ive got some work in front of me no doubt
3881935 youre never satisfied with any lead until the season is over but i feel like im in a decent position its probably going to be a good battle to the end just like it was last year
3881936 im hoping to take the win in both events zemke competes in supersport and formula xtreme
3881937 there are only three races left in each series and being able to win them all would be awesome
3881938 i was fast in practice all weekend and i felt i rode well if you know you rode your best it really helps give you that extra shot in the arm and bolsters your confidence i took the win in both classes at vir in 2007 and we should be able to do it again it is a very physical track and the weather can be extremely hot and sticky the weather in my hometown is definitely hot and humid and i train outside every day i either ride my bicycle or go motocrossing i like being outside and daily training makes me feel ready to race my best
3881939 it is older than some of the tracks we compete on and it is somewhat different it is almost like running on three different sections and there are lots of elevation changes in the back you have to link the corners to make it all work my game plan is pretty much the same as always and that is to qualify well and get out in front as soon as possible our hondas are really spot on so we should only have to make minimal changes and we will be good to go

3881946 they told me they were going to kill me unless i stopped preaching my mystic gospel god is the greatest and i didnt come to die on death row theyre trying to silence me because i know about the satanic secret societies of the tdc texas department of corrections shadow government e system
3881947 it makes no sense for the state to keep someone on death row under severe conditions when hes been recognized as severely ill
3881948 not really a factor in this case what the factor is is that riles was competent when he was tried and given a legal sentence his confinement is still legal and he simply has a condition right now that makes him not eligible for execution but that could change

3882025 the next year will be a difficult one with inflation high and output broadly flat
3882026 but with monetary policy focused on its task of bringing inflation back to the target we will come through that adjustment
3882027 broadly flat output means there is a possibility of a quarter or two of negative growth

3882037 in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3882038 we fully expect russia to keep its word to provide free access to humanitarian assistance and allow any of our assistance to arrive either by military or commercial means by air land and sea

3882040 freebsd has the ability to run linux programs without recompilation
3882041 for example i use adobe acrobat reader for linux on my freebsd laptop it works flawlessly
3882042 our users have found zfs very robust and reliable in many environments especially 64 bit platforms with ample memory
3882043 zfs is a relatively new feature and relatively complex so were erring on the side of caution in advising our users to keep a close eye on things before deploying them
3882044 our branches live as long as the developers and community support them
3882045 remember the freebsd project is composed entirely of freebsd users freebsd 6 still has a healthy active user community while we expect that users will gradually migrate toward 7 0 our users are still interested in supporting version 6
3882046 competition doesnt really enter into it for most of us
3882047 you dont see freebsd developers sitting in a smoke filled room plotting the overthrow of microsoft we sit in light airy rooms and plot where to get the best drinks
3882048 those people who install freebsd 7 0 and say wow this performs so much better than freebsd 6 havent seen the thousands of tiny steps our developers made to work that change

3882065 western countries should not support them israel so much the life of this regime has come to an end

3882071 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3882072 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3882073 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3882074 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3882075 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3882076 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3882077 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies

3882081 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3882082 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3882083 live up to the obligations it undertook just 24 hours ago
3882084 so that russia can begin to dig out of the hole that its gotten itself into
3882085 engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
3882086 and that is why russia is starting to face international condemnation for what it is doing
3882087 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3882088 we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3882089 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3882090 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3882091 will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3882092 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or sea ports to conduct this mission
3882093 you kind of either just look around and laugh or just like enjoy it
3882094 were in awe its a whirlwind and were happy to be on the ride
3882095 for us having this album finally hit stores and having them sing the songs knowing that they can actually hear them and have it in their possession is the most amazing thing for us were so excited
3882096 they really in the last year kicked into high gear with coming to the shows following the music and continuing to talk about it online
3882097 the online thing has been really big for us the all of that but for us all of them outside make it all possible
3882098 weve been here since monday afternoon at twelve so weve been camping out all night and it was so cold when it hit 3 a m
3882099 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3882100 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3882101 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3882102 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3882103 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3882104 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3882105 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3882106 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3882107 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3882108 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3882109 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3882110 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3882111 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3882112 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3882113 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
3882114 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3882115 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
3882116 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3882117 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3882118 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3882119 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3882120 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3882121 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3882122 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3882123 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3882124 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3882125 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3882126 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action

3882129 we took up station guarding the opposed landing on the abkhaz shore when all of a sudden four high speed targets were detected we sent out an iff signal and the targets didnt react receiving a command from the flagship we got into formation and right at that moment the unidentified targets opened fire on the ship formation and flagship the cruiser was damaged and a small fire broke out aboard then fearing for seaworthyness the flagship withdrew from the firing area

3882137 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia
3882138 we were appealing to everybody in the international community including russia saying stop that unfortunately no help came
3882139 the sight of russian tanks in gorki russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3882141 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3882142 the problem with this kind of criticism is that precisely fits the narrative of monogamous marriage
3882143 as professionals we can do a lot to make sex workers benefit from prejudice free public or community services we can take action to oppose stigmatization in our environments and make better informed interventions to properly fulfill these womens needs
3882144 we are delighted to be able to provide parents this free tool to help protect children from the dangers posed by the internet and internet content
3882145 any regulation of carbon dioxide is going to be controversial because its going to raise energy costs
3882146 with permits you can trade with a wide variety of entities to achieve the lowest cost solution
3882147 some people say taxes are better because an uncertain price hurts firms
3882148 their argument is that if a firm doesnt know what the price is going to be its harder for the firm to make decisions regarding capital investments and r amp d
3882149 firms deal with uncertainty all the time they buy inputs that have volatile prices
3882150 electric utilities for example face uncertain coal prices they use financial instruments to deal with that uncertainty
3882151 initially the permits may be thinly traded because people are trying to figure out what the right price is
3882152 power plants participating in the program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions 22 percent 7 3 million tons below mandated levels
3882153 probably the greatest green success story of the last decade
3882154 you couldnt just take the sulfur dioxide program and plop it down for greenhouses gases but i thought it would work well for a variety of reasons
3882155 something like 70 percent of the sulfur dioxide emissions came from electric utilities
3882156 there were other sources too but congress decided that itd get a big chunk of the emissions from regulating the utilities and that it was going to let the other 30 percent go thatll happen with carbon dioxide well look for the big chunks that we can get in the lowest cost way
3882157 so theres a great legal environment to enforce the property rights associated with tradable permits and there are enforcement bodies that can litigate to ensure compliance
3882158 so to solve the issue you need a global program and theres no uniform regulatory body that governs the world
3882159 the thing to keep in mind is that you can create a demand for products that cost more but have environmental benefits attached to them
3882160 i would like to get to know someone that is approximately my height it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life

3882174 the brain consists of a collection of neurons cultured on a multi electrode array mea it communicates and controls the robot via a bluetooth connection
3882175 the robots biological brain is made up of cultured neurons which are placed onto a multi electrode array mea the mea is a dish with approximately 60 electrodes which pick up the electrical signals generated by the cells this is then used to drive the movement of the robot every time the robot nears an object signals are directed to stimulate the brain by means of the electrodes in response the brains output is used to drive the wheels of the robot left and right so that it moves around in an attempt to avoid hitting objects the robot has no additional control from a human or a computer its sole means of control is from its own brain
3882176 how memories manifest themselves in the brain when the robot revisits familiar territory
3882177 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
3882178 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions
3882179 investigating the computational capacity of cultured neuronal networks using machine learning
3882180 in this project the neural cultures will be cultured locally in the university of readings new electrophysiological research laboratory allowing real time access to the recording and stimulation hardware via an intranet link up
3882181 architecture for living neuronal cell control of a mobile robot
3882182 in this presentation a look is taken at how the use of implant and electrode technology can be employed to create biological brains for robots to enable human enhancement and to diminish the effects of certain neural illnesses
3882183 we all recall of course john mccain s outrage when the united states violated this rule back in 2003

3882190 the key linguistic debate has been whether to reduce the number of abortions or reduce the need for abortions

3882193 judge williams essentially has the position that you cant do a long term offender designation without a period of community supervision
3882194 counsel for mr aylward and myself having reviewed the exact same provisions are of a different position were of the position that parliament has clearly mandated a regime that does allow for a long term offender designation without a period of community supervision
3882195 i would suspect that will weigh very heavily against him if and when he does make an application to be released on parole
3882196 mr aylward is very much aware of the fact that what he did was very wrong
3882197 he is remorseful one of the reasons there was a guilty plea was that he did not want the young victim of this crime to have to come to court and testify and that was one of the things that weighed very heavily on him

3882202 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3882203 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3882204 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3882205 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3882206 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3882207 we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect

3882241 in a bold front page headline kaieteur news announced that the minister of health admitted that the ministry of health procured goods illegally it is a blatant lie and questions the motives of the kaieteur news
3882242 anyone reading the story would be utterly disappointed with the headline because the story itself is inconsistent with the headline the problem is the highly provocative and mischievous headline i would not question media practitioners right to produce headlines to attract more readers and greater interest in their newspapers but this right should not permit them to be slanderous and allow them to ever misrepresent the truth the headline was reckless and irresponsible
3882243 various groups in and out of guyana jump on a bandwagon defending the medias rights but no one ever seems to worry about the deliberate attempts by media houses to distort stories misrepresenting the truth
3882244 as a minister of the government should i simply allow the media to distort as they please in order to demonstrate tolerance and underline how free the press is should i now ban all news reporters from kaieteur news from calling me and only allow them access to my open press briefing if i do so would this be protecting the ministrys interest or would it be an attack on press freedom

3882301 textiles is in my blood ive been involved with the business since my young days when i was 18 19 years for instance i had a small shirt unit under me it made a turnover of about rs 30 crore it was a great learning experience for me to be able to handle a unit on my own
3882302 there have been phases when theres been a boom in the industry phases when theres been a slowdown weve seen it all
3882303 there was never anything that missed his eye he would get into the nitty gritty of things at some level i may have picked it up from him
3882304 there are certain areas for instance weve identified where acquisitions can be undertaken these include high value cotton ready to wear and home textiles the idea is to operate and manage systems abroad for instance a shirt manufacturer in the premium segment who supplies to leading shirt brands in the world or a mid premium fashion house that designs and distributes ready to wear garments in europe or a unit that designs and distributes home textiles would be companies we would target
3882305 india is the second largest producer of apparels and textiles after china
3882306 but our contribution to world consumption is just about 3 3 5 chinas contribution on the other hand is about 24 25 with the ability that textile manufacturers here have i think we are in a position to leverage our skill sets to cater to the international market and be an lternative to china
3882307 we are always on the lookout for areas we can get into it helps diversification of business is important you are not dependent on one line or product segment you have many from which you can draw your revenues
3882308 we should close this fiscal with a turnover of rs 3 300 crore rs 2 600 crore from sknl and reid amp taylor put together and rs 700 crore from brandhouse retails
3882309 they are young now so i dont see them heading the business right away they do demonstrate the potential though they have their feet firmly on the ground much like i did but theyd have to work hard to earn their position in the company

3882395 price reduced is a marketing ploy used to increase the short term sales of commodity items like ball point pens at an office store you arent selling a commodity as an impulse item custom homes are unique products that should be marketed and sold as such many home buyers are not buying new upscale homes right now because either 1 they can not sell the home they currently live in or because 2 they cant get loan approval neither of these reasons can be resolved by the builder reducing price brad didnt use prices going up as his mailer header to incentivize his prospects to act now before the prices increase nor did he use price reduced fortunately we did discuss plenty of other ways for him to sell the two specs hes been sitting on for over two years ask yourself what can we do to increase sales given the market condition
3882396 how to rent vacation properties by owner 2nd edition the complete guide to buy manage furnish rent maintain and advertise your vacation rental investment
3882397 renting out your vacation home allows you to have your cake and eat it too and the good news is its easy to do it yourself not to mention surprisingly lucrative
3882398 life rarely turns out to look like we thought it was going to look
3882399 thats okay some of the happiest most successful people ive met during my years working in this field never dreamed they would rent out their vacation home and yet once they tried it they love doing it it pays to be flexible and keep your options open
3882400 traditionally many retirees would sell the home they lived in for forty years downsize to a smaller house or apartment and split their time between that home and their vacation place in say florida
3882401 but there are drawbacks to doing that you lose your neighbors youre no longer close to your familiar grocery store and so forth and you dont get to pass the homestead down to your kids rent out your vacation home and you can have the best of both worlds you can afford both places its the perfect balanced solution
3882402 when people decide to postpone retirement they may also postpone moving to their retirement home
3882403 even if they do retire and then rejoin the workforce either full time or part time they may not want to live in the city they associate with retirement its a psychological thing and so in these cases its better to keep the vacation home a vacation home renting it out allows them to do that
3882404 if you have a mortgage on your second home renting it out only seventeen weeks will cover your mortgage payments for an entire year
3882405 if its paid for free and clear only five off week rentals will cover costs like bills for your phone power cable and association dues all the rest is profit when you consider that in some markets you can earn as much as 30k 40k in rental revenue per year from your vacation home youre looking at a nice raise for yourself
3882406 heres another good reason for seniors to rent by owner they typically have time to handle the details
3882407 not that theres a huge amount of work involved but it is easier to respond to renter inquiries do bookkeeping orchestrate routine maintenance details and so forth when you arent tied down to small children and or a demanding career plus vacation rental homeowners often meet interesting people and form friendships with them and retirees tend to have more time to nurture these relationships
3882408 who knows becoming a vacation rental property owner may become your encore career
3882409 buying and renting out vacation homes is addictive ive done this for years and i cant imagine ever not doing it its more than a way to make money its a richly rewarding way of life at any age

3882422 remodelers are experiencing slower activity in markets nationwide particularly for major improvements to owner occupied housing
3882423 while markets remain pretty active most remodelers are taking on a greater number of smaller jobs to maintain their businesses
3882424 as in previous economic downturns remodeling activity is proving to be cyclical rather than countercyclical although the degree of decline pales in comparison to the setbacks registered in the new home market said nahb chief economist david seiders
3882425 we expect remodeling to remain generally flat in 2009 followed by strong growth due to home maintenance needs

3882434 it is also a responsible and green form of media
3882435 our clients appreciate the lack of non stop and nearly worthless snail mail soliciting business lowes pieces have true value to our clients not just from a green perspective but their e mail and print campaigns include valuable information that homeowners can actually use valuable coupons that save money on items they actually need and tips to help them maintain the value of their property

3882456 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3882457 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3882458 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3882459 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

3882461 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3882462 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3882463 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3882464 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3882465 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

3882572 it was a good learning experience playing with so many great players our whole defensive line could play on the d1 level we love to compete against one another but it makes us better there is no jealousy or anything like that because of it
3882573 kendrick is the strongest player we have had here since i have been at south panola he benched 225 twenty seven times in the spring you watch the nfl combine and you will see a lot of the linemen entering the draft who can not do what strong is doing at 16 years old he has great strength and quickness he has the first step you are looking for on the d1 level

3882575 i grew up a tennessee vol fan i like their defense and how their defensive coordinator goes in there and mixes up their plays they play real aggressive i like their defense and memphis has a pretty good team they use to have a real good running back they are only a couple of hours from the house too

3882581 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
3882582 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
3882583 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
3882584 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighbouring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
3882585 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
3882586 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
3882587 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
3882588 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
3882589 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
3882590 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
3882591 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary

3882601 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3882602 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3882603 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3882604 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3882605 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope

3882610 amid the obviously more serious real word consequences in the ongoing russia georgia conflict the parallel virtual battle has been garnering a fair amount of attention in sum russian hackers have been assaulting and disabling a number of georgias government web sites largely its seems by employing botnet driven denial of service attacks since the inception of the conflict as always with this kind of cyberwarfare its difficult to sort out whether the russian government is actively supporting the attacks or just the tacit beneficiary of some of its gung ho and computer savvy citizens as of a few minutes ago the main government site in georgia remained down there have been reports of attacks on russian sites as well monday the wall street journal cited investigators who claimed to have traced the attack to a notorious cybergang called the russian business network but wireds danger room found skeptics of that assessment

3882623 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3882624 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3882625 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3882626 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3882627 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper

3882667 myself mr cappelli and the partners are going to work very closely with the state of new york and the federal government to achieve whatever funding is necessary to pay for the hard and soft costs associated with the baseball stadium
3882668 significant drain on the financial viability of the overall project
3882669 the sizing of the bond issues is deemed to be inordinately risky for the city
3882670 we know there are concerns about major elements they are being addressed by consultants on all sides and once those issues have been addressed those details will be made public
3882671 the ballpark adds a certain aura to the project that makes it different from than any mixed use retail housing development and that creates a buzz
3882672 it is with deep regret that we acknowledge and mourn the death of sergeant ulloa
3882673 on behalf of all new yorkers i want to extend our heartfelt condolences to the family friends and fellow soldiers of sergeant ulloa his sacrifice to our country will never be forgotten
3882674 wi fi helps make the internet more accessible to people
3882675 once you get to the internet then you can go look at your e mail you can go to websites you can pretty much do anything
3882676 certainly on the consumer side theres terrific growth because people have reached the point where they are familiar with wi fi they have it on their laptops and connect when they are travelling
3882677 voice over wi fi is still a cutting edge technology
3882678 people in the future will have more and more devices that are wi fi enabled
3882679 one of the earliest municipalities to embrace it and develop it was fredericton in new brunswick
3882680 if you come to fredericton it looks like any town except that you see people all over the place with their equipment and theyre happily connecting for free
3882681 it was sold as we will put it in and it will be free
3882682 but if you put together some wi fi hot spots at the corner coffee shop that doesnt mean you can do the network for a whole metropolitan area wi fi was never designed to cover a big urban area
3882683 naturally youre getting persistent concerns on that front because the housing data really isnt getting much better nor do i expect it will for a while
3882684 and that in turn is going to make any significant recovery in the financials bottom line some time off
3882685 all of these elements that were internal were comfortable with but the external macroeconomic items we dont have visibility so thats why we cant provide guidance for 2009
3882686 i think its more about the visibility and the increased cotton and energy prices and people are nervous about what does that mean for 2009
3882687 our business is very strong weve never had a larger open order position in the history of the company during the third quarter so were very excited and optimistic about our volumes for next year
3882688 i think we should have scored in the first half
3882689 you dont get many chances and you have to take them we didnt do that we lost concentration on two occasions and got punished
3882690 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3882691 it was very difficult to play against that team they started very well and it was important for us to be strong
3882692 they were very passionate but in the second half we worked hard because we want to qualify for the champions league it is a big competition for us
3882693 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3882694 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3882695 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3882696 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable

3882700 now putin wants to show the west that he also can show the west its limits
3882701 right now theres a lot of adult mosquitoes out there that are biting and a number of these will have the virus
3882702 its out there so look out for the mosquitoes because the virus could be the one that bites you
3882703 the counties around here albany rensselaer saratoga counties have had positive birds have had positive mosquitoes over the past several years
3882704 before summer ends we will have some people who will undoubtedly succumb
3882705 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3882706 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3882707 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death

3882711 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3882712 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is
3882713 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
3882714 the last few days four or five days weve seen one of the most unexpected crises in the world as the russians moved into georgia as aggressors
3882715 and if you read the statements from the beginning senator mccain and senator obama one had kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience the other senator mccain was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always wants to be

3882721 he had so many things wrong he stopped eating he just wanted to lay there
3882722 the area i live in is totally infested with raccoons
3882723 they run along the fences theyre in the garbage theyre in your yard they try to dig up plants
3882724 the most common cause is wildlife urinating and getting into stagnant water and then a dog coming along and drinking that water
3882725 it can actually go in and affect the liver and kidney
3882726 what we found is that the liver enzymes were right off the scale
3882727 you have to look at the risk factor of your own dog and decide whether you want to vaccinate or not or keep the animal on a leash so you know what theyre getting into
3882728 these are not tame animals theyre not supposed to be here in the numbers that they are
3882729 what a staff person would do is offer advice depending upon the information that they receive
3882730 our first advice always is to try to make it as easy as possible for animals and humans to co habitat
3882731 if they really want the animal removed then people have the choice of trapping the animals themselves
3882732 ze volgden ons overal op het veld we stonden constant man tegen man fc twente speelde met veel overtuiging ze hebben het ons moeilijk gemaakt uiteindelijk gaf onze technische superioriteit de doorslag

3882744 the first firefighter had fire trucks pulled out of the hall just in case the hall would catch fire where we were so close
3882745 with the heavy fire load with epoxies glues resins and a boat in there burning we had to look at what we could save and what we couldnt save
3882746 this has been a tragic loss to the community to employees to our customers as well as to the owners of the yard
3882747 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action

3882751 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

3882759 second quarter results continued the trend seen in quarter one all in line with prevailing capital market conditions none the less we remain convinced that we are building a solid and scalable financial services firm that is increasingly well positioned
3882760 by the nature of its business certain aspects of the corporations revenue will tend to rise and fall with financial markets but the corporation is now very well placed both to weather weaker periods and to capitalize quickly when conditions improve
3882761 we are very pleased with our operating performance this year
3882762 our effective sales and marketing programs our focus on strong resident relations and investments in the productive capacity of our property portfolio are enabling us to capitalize on the strengthening fundamentals in the canadian rental residential business
3882763 we are particularly pleased that coming off a very harsh winter with record cold temperatures in many of our markets our energy management initiatives continue to reduce our utilities cost as a percentage of revenues looking ahead we are confident our investments in energy saving initiatives combined with our proactive hedging programs will continue to control these costs and enhance our profitability
3882764 the outlook for the canadian residential rental business continues to improve demand continues to grow driven by the high cost of home ownership tightened availability for home purchase financing increased immigration and a rapidly growing seniors population that views rental accommodation as a cost effective choice with a strong balance sheet enhanced operating performance and a strong market presence as canadas landlord of choice we are well positioned to continue enhancing unitholder value over the long term
3882765 sales in the second quarter failed to show their normal seasonal improvement over the first quarter and were sharply below year earlier levels market conditions in our three key end markets manufactured housing new construction and residential remodeling are abysmal the weakest ive ever seen making matters worse we have not seen any of the softening of raw material prices that has accompanied downturns in the past instead costs for raw materials and energy have continued to rise rapidly
3882766 we have taken significant further action to try and mitigate the impact of the weak demand and high costs
3882767 while i do not anticipate the economic climate improving any time soon i am somewhat more optimistic about our own results particularly as we enter 2009 we have made securing additional business a high priority over the past year and i am pleased to report that these efforts have resulted in new programs that we expect will result in 12 million to 18 million of incremental sales next year this increased volume together with the full year impact of our recent cost reductions and price increases should help us get through the challenging environment we anticipate will continue into 2009
3882768 we were disappointed with the recent finding that the joint reorganization plan supported by all our creditor groups was found unconfirmable by the bankruptcy court however the official committee of bondholders the asbestos creditors committee and the future claimants representative have recently reached an agreement in principle which we believe resolves these issues and i expect a new plan will be filed within the next few months that we believe will comply with the courts prior decisions
3882769 historically the third quarter is the weakest of the year and fiscal 2008 is no exception however given the year over year improvement in our financial results for nine months and the outlook for the fourth quarter we anticipate that cv technologies will realize its fiscal 2008 growth and profitability goals moreover our financial position continues to be strong
3882770 bentley green is one of the most compelling individuals i have ever met even at the age of 7 i recently had the honor of spending a few days getting to know him and it was obvious to me is that his talent is only transcended by his intelligence and infectious personality he has an ability to own the stage like no child entertainer ive seen since michael jackson
3882771 we take our responsibility very seriously we want to introduce bentley to a world where he can excel as an artist at all levels without losing sight of the fact that he is a child
3882772 one of bentleys greatest gifts is his versatility he can dance circles around dancers years older rap alongside the elite of the hip hop industry and act as if he was born to the industry

3882780 we continued to capitalize on opportunities across western canada with a focus in the oil sands to deliver another quarter of strong growth
3882781 our impressive revenue performance was driven by high first quarter activity levels across all of our business segments although we encountered challenges on one of our oil sands mining projects our consolidated operations were significantly more profitable than a year ago we were also successful in recovering a portion of fiscal 2007 pipeline related losses
3882782 we are pleased with the continued growth and momentum we are achieving in our business
3882783 fiscal 2009 is off to an excellent start with all three of our business segments driving our growth
3882784 we are pursuing a diverse range of opportunities in all of our key markets and particularly in the oil sands where the scale of projects continues to grow our biggest challenge is ensuring we have the people and the equipment to respond we are continuing to build on our internal resources while also actively pursuing opportunities that either consolidate our position and reputation in the oil sands or contribute to diversification by securing opportunities in other resource industries
3882785 we expect our momentum will continue to build as the year progresses

3882789 instead of ignoring what happened five years ago and hoping for the best we must embrace the lessons of that experience and work towards a modernized energy infrastructure that is more resilient secure reliable and efficient
3882790 the smart alternative securing and strengthening our nations vulnerable electric grid
3882791 the market for distributed solar energy is developing at breakneck speed driven by the inherent value of being able to generate clean electricity at the same place its being consumed
3882792 while a lot of top executives talk green these days for darbee green has become the business model one that represents the future of the utility industry in a carbon constrained age
3882793 interest in all things green has risen to a red hot pitch recently with more and more people jumping on the sustainability bandwagon so much so that now environmentalist blogs and consumer advocacy groups are wondering if the trend has peaked
3882794 the green marketplace roared back to life as products making environmental claims became more prevalent including some from bigger companies
3882795 we dont see this trend in sustainability waning at any time we think it is a cultural shift and we intend to take advantage of it
3882796 consumers expressed skepticism over companies green claims calling them just a sales tactic and expressing reluctance to pay extra for such products that view was echoed by business leaders who said that even though companies are greening products of all kinds buyers are unwilling to pay a green premium
3882797 the idea is that interactive connections would give utility customers real time information about energy rates and let them plan their activities accordingly instead of doing the laundry in the afternoon when power is expensive youd be able to see when rates are lower and save money by doing the wash then
3882798 broadband is to narrowband as an eight lane highway is to a two lane street
3882799 claiming that low speed meters cannot connect to a broadband grid is like claiming that drivers on a city street cannot merge onto an interstate
3882800 lower speed meters could clog existing bandwidth with trouble reports during an outage preventing utilities from getting an accurate fix on the scope of a problem or where to send repair crews
3882801 lazarus admits that broadband meters would cost as much as five times more but believes the utilities should burden ratepayers with this expense because the real question is how smart grids will be used five or 10 years from now according to mr lazarus california ratepayers should be angry they will be paying 4 6 billion for their new meters instead they should be clamoring to pay up to five times more 23 billion to have broadband meters instead
3882802 all social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision making known as cognitive biases

3882804 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3882805 what we found somewhat to our surprise is that both groups of people whether they were treated with stenting or medical therapy that over one to two months they all had substantial improvement in quality of life
3882806 we also found there was some advantage in being treated with stenting but not over time
3882807 the conclusion is that people are going to get better and there is some advantage to stenting but it is not that large the majority of people can be treated with medical therapy alone
3882808 so the courage trial tells us that in this low risk population we should try medical therapy first and if it fails we should move on to coronary stenting
3882809 low levels of social support directly predict depression even controlling for other risk factors
3882810 countless studies document the link between society and psyche people who have close friends and confidants friendly neighbors and supportive coworkers are less likely to experience sadness loneliness low self esteem and problems with eating and sleeping

3882819 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3882820 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3882821 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth

3882840 hydrogen vehicles there are two different kinds theres a fuel cell vehicle and a hydrogen engine vehicle but the common theme is that they all have a hydrogen tank its just a matter of how they use the hydrogen in the vehicle
3882841 they all have no carbon emissions at all no co2 in the case of the fuel cell vehicles theres absolutely zero emissions at all coming out of the tailpipe just water vapor that safe enough to drink
3882842 when you use hydrogen in an internal combustion engine you really have the same performance at least with engines designed to run on gasoline and in the future when we design an engine around the fuel well actually be able to surpass the performance of a gasoline engine
3882843 when are we going to be able to get our hands on one
3882844 its going to take time we want to be in a position where the market will drive those outcomes and if consumers want hydrogen driven cars and thats the market the infrastructure will follow that

3882877 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3882878 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3882879 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3882880 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3882881 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3882882 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3882883 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3882884 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3882885 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3882929 support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending ten billion dollars a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy
3882930 barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
3882931 here the proposed draft was provided we politely reviewed it said thanks but no thanks and ultimately decided to go another way
3882932 this is a good old boy system that is killing the rights of consumers
3882933 to say we have been in collusion with someone over this brief is not correct and unfair
3882934 we are not taking a side the governor hopes that the people deserving of medical monitoring receive the medical monitoring that they need
3882935 governor manchin just showed us hes more concerned with big business in west virginia than with the health and well being of our families and children
3882936 maybe governor manchin should come here and try to explain his actions
3882937 just the simplest things bother me allergies a runny nose on a daily basis it worries and bothers me
3882938 might feel different maybe if his own family members were involved
3882939 the governor made his own judgment based on the issues
3882940 and his office wrote and filed their own brief with the west virginia supreme court
3882941 this is a high profile high dollar case so i can imagine that feelings and tempers may be fairly high
3882942 but from our point of view it is not unusual for this governor or other governors to participate in matters that are before the courts that have a direct impact on west virginia it is certainly not indicative of corruption
3882943 i have been encouraged by the direction weve been going in
3882944 im happy theyre doing it but i know that it will be gone after november
3882945 youll never see politics or information on any of these networks

3882948 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3882949 hes been pretty courageous about going into places where he wouldnt expect to have a lot of support
3882950 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3882951 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3882952 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3882953 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3882954 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3882955 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3882956 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3882957 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3882958 we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3882959 i was cut open so you could be born therefore you need to worry more about what i think than what your friends think
3882960 i think evans real strength is you get someone on the ticket who has a record of being strong on national security and that is a very important quality to have

3882969 the embedded republican vote in a presidential election has been fairly solid for almost three decades now so you would have to say that mccain has an edge but im going to tell you that the obama people have been pouring resources in here
3882970 the obama campaign has some potential to win some voters to change the dynamics by making a strong run in the big metropolitan areas here filled with high tech workers and the type of people who dont fit the classic old south new south model
3882971 shes a bit of a fool thats the only thing you can say
3882972 dont forget cokie roberts and the whole washington crowd live in a kind of an incestuous relationship to one another they talk to one another they see one another they know nothing about ordinary people
3882973 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3882974 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3882975 the theme of mondays program is one nation the opening night of the convention will highlight senator obamas life story his commitment to change and the voices of americans who are calling for a new direction for this country
3882976 barack obamas story is an american story that reflects a life of struggle opportunity and responsibility like those faced by americans everyday
3882977 admitted the party had no other hopes of unseating an incumbent democrat
3882978 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3882979 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion

3883016 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3883017 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3883018 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3883019 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3883020 sitting on your hands and either not discussing the issue publicly or claiming there is no problem when a firestorm of people are online complaining about difficulties means the inferno is just going to get bigger and bigger
3883021 if apple finally does admit there is some sort of systemic issue the result would be disastrous
3883022 apple installing a kill switch and not telling anyone caused a firestorm in the application developer community online
3883023 obviously our multi platform olympic strategy is a success but this record breaking olympic performance is proving that network television is more alive than ever

3883037 i also wanted to say that its not just plan b that pharmacists will refuse to fill dispense there have been 2 specific occasions that i can recall where women have brought in prescriptions for cytotec misoprostol and a pain pill which is often used when women have had a miscarriage to pass any tissue that may be left this pharmacist immediately began to question the doctors prescription and whether it was being used to cause an abortion in both instances he wound up talking to the women about it i guess so he could have a clear conscience about it one of the women had her young son with her and she had to tell him to step aside so she could explain to the pharmacist that yes she had had a miscarriage and that was why the doctor had prescribed it i should also mention that he keeps a list of abortion alternatives phone s for crisis pregnancy centers in this town and a couple of surrounding towns next to his computer you know just in case
3883038 honestly what i think this brings into very sharp relief is how scary the prospect of a continued bush foreign policy is because right now we could be doing something if the idea of american diplomacy and american international leadership and american moral authority were something other than a punchline

3883050 in all truthfulness what really matters is whether more students are becoming ready for college and career
3883051 thats why we think its time to change the focus of our dialogue and we ought to be focused on are we making significant inroads in preparing more students to become ready for college course work
3883052 at the same time we need to see it as an opportunity to make changes in the system and how we serve those students

3883347 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3883348 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3883349 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3883350 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3883351 sitting on your hands and either not discussing the issue publicly or claiming there is no problem when a firestorm of people are online complaining about difficulties means the inferno is just going to get bigger and bigger
3883352 if apple finally does admit there is some sort of systemic issue the result would be disastrous

3883359 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3883360 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3883361 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3883362 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3883363 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3883364 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3883365 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3883366 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3883367 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3883373 the beach program helps to protect new hampshires coast through consistent high quality monitoring of contaminants
3883374 exposure to contaminants is preventable monitoring allows us to address any potential problem quickly and effectively

3883610 our hindu organisations temples and institutions have become the beacons of hope sustenance national pride and most significantly sentinels of patriotism bhakti is a defensive mechanism and an offensive weapon in this independence day special we track some of these great men and their mission unlike the missionaries and the venom spewing terror merchants their appeal is universal their message is for peace and prosperity and they serve humans as a whole they are winning hearts not harvesting souls for demographic invasion
3883611 but for such men the shenanigans of the upa would have produced faster results for today for a hindu to remain a hindu other than his tradition loving family elders the good work of thousands of our iconic spiritual leaders who have become cult figures of universal appeal and the great service activities they have taken up in the length and breadth of the country there is nothing left it is a disadvantage in a professional sense to be a hindu
3883612 in an age with a plethora of god men gurus preachers some so popular as to have ashrams in many states and even in many countries it is an astonishing truth that society is rudderless adrift on an ocean of hedonism without spiritual and moral guidance the fault lies with star gurus who seek self aggrandisement by building huge cult followings and five star ashrams where rich indian and foreign devotees can practice yoga and meditation in comfort in salubrious resort like environs justifying the marxist slander of religion as the opium of the people they peddle lullabies to frustrated millions seeking release from lifes myriad problems such vicarious redemption is totally un hindu and extremely harmful as it turns a blind eye to festering evils and allows them to multiply under cover of a gurus benign gaze
3883613 as the majority community the ill health of the hindu community impacts the nation as a whole other religious communities may have problems but their impact is in proportion to their relative numbers hindus therefore dominate the national discourse when it comes to social problems most notably the growing menace of dowry female foeticide sexual harassment and new forms of exploitation in the natal and marital homes then there are new forms of caste animosities and perverted forms of addressing religious issues in sharp contrast to the vigorous debates by social and religious reformers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries there are no great men to analyse and articulate the ills of the day much less offer solutions

3883625 its not a matter of possession its how you use the possession that counts you have to be really effective with the ball in hand because of the sanctions at the breakdown
3883626 you dont want to get caught at the breakdown too often in your own territory because you are likely to have a free kick against you and then you hand momentum to the other team
3883627 hence a lot of teams are kicking a lot more than they did in the past you want to attack if theres opportunity but if not you want to put the pressure back on the other team
3883628 i went to the game against argentina in johannesburg and they are certainly quick they are big and they have good hands so they are trying to play more expansively

3883630 unfortunately the flash player can not easily make use of this since sorenson on2 or h 264 video data even though it is decoded as yuv has to be converted to rgb and possibly combined with other graphical elements this is why rgb scaling via opengl is the future of flash
3883631 yep the direct rendering test is the one that crashes
3883632 flash always covers drop down menus so those menus become invisible thank you for your efforts
3883633 i would suggest forking off a new process setting a new segv handler with sigaction and running the check there if it crashes tell the original process that gl isnt available
3883634 i would be careful with that its not unusual for systems to be configured to automatically create a core dump when an app sigsegvs and if a regularly run app were to silently spawn a child that crashes it would end up leaving a mess in the unsuspecting users home directory
3883635 and converting back to yuv space after compositing so that scaling can use hw acceleration is that difficult concept to come up with jesus

3883666 contractors should not be subjected to any greater requirement than federal employees and today only new federal employees are required to be verified through the e verify system
3883667 all of these issues must be addressed before any far rule is put into place
3883668 it is clear that the federal government should lead the way in using this new technology that protects american workers and employers
3883669 this executive order is at least a start towards re imposing the rule of law in an increasingly unlawful employment environment
3883670 contractors that use e verify to confirm the employment eligibility of their workforce are much less likely to face immigration enforcement actions and are generally more efficient and dependable procurement sources than contractors that do not use that system to verify the work eligibility of their workforce

3883682 w e urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
3883683 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
3883684 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
3883685 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs reports indicate that biological chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre gulf war status in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
3883686 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them

3883717 daarmee lijkt het alsof het er altijd zo aan toe gaat op de universiteit maar dat is natuurlijk niet waar colleges worden niet gegeven in een tent waarvan de grond dreunt door het geluid uit de tent ernaast
3883718 onderwerpen als politiek of jongerencultuur krijgen de festivalgangers het hele jaar door al mee die onderwerpen trekken dus weinig publiek maar verhalen over nanotechnologie of gentechnologie horen jongeren gewoonlijk niet en die willen ze blijkbaar toch graag horen van een ouder wijzer iemand
3883719 we laten ze meestal geen dingen schrappen het gaat meer van oh dat stukje is interessant dan focussen ze daar meer op soms vragen we de inhoud wat aan te passen maar meestal mag het van ons juist wel wat meer diepgang krijgen

3883730 will barack obama be the next president of the united states its hard to say but one shouldnt be foolish enough to dismiss his chances outright we live in desperate and extraordinary times and the american people if only out of sheer desperation might very well turn towards an extraordinary candidate that very fact is enough to put the good senator over the top we can only hope talk about audacity

3883739 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3883740 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3883741 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia

3883753 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3883754 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation

3883758 on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defence of a free georgia
3883759 the georgian leadership is a special project for the united states
3883760 at some time it will be necessary to choose between supporting this virtual project and real partnership on questions which actually require collective action
3883761 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3883762 we do not need nor do we intend to take over any air or seaports in order to deliver humanitarian assistance to those caught in this conflict

3883770 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3883771 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
3883772 each mutual fund you invest in should have its own benchmark even if it is an index fund and your portfolio should be an appropriate fixed mix of those benchmarks the benchmarks should all be capitalization weighted indexes that represent the investable universe in that asset class
3883773 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
3883774 t he option should exist to invest in the benchmark as an alternative to the portfolio under consideration

3883783 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3883784 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3883785 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3883795 if theres one truism in economics i believe its that recessions always kill inflation every time without a doubt theres no way around it even in stagflation once youre stuck in a recession your prices are going to plunge
3883796 so which is the better measure of inflationary expectations the spread between tips and treasuries or a spread between tips and a risk adjusted rate for all long bonds
3883797 the proposed price does not reflect the strength of unionbancals strong capital position the superior credit quality of its assets and its potential for profitable asset and core deposit growth in the current market environment
3883798 india is the fastest growing market for us though we are seeing huge growth in other emerging economies like china brazil and russia
3883799 this is of great significance to us as the notebooks have only been launched in san francisco and london last night
3883800 by 2015 the number of pcs in india will grow 10 times and in the last year our personal computer sales in india grew by 99 compared to the previous year
3883801 you will see us in devices of smaller screens the line between computing devices and smartphones is blurring
3883802 our strategy has always been to deliver value for money products and we have to see how we can do that in the lower price range we are looking at creating a nokia like perception in the country
3883803 our sales in the first half of the year have been good and we expect second half sales to be even better it is in such times of slowdown that people look for ways to increase productivity

3883806 indias credit profile has worsened in the past twelve months but we believe the upside and downside risks to its bbb rating are currently balanced
3883807 this assumes however that the reasons for credit deterioration are temporary if we conclude that they are longer lasting indias credit ratings could be lowered again to speculative grade
3883808 we expect inflation to touch 9 10 by march 2009 we will have to take a look at the effectiveness of the monetary measures used by the central bank however there is a possibility that the rbi would further tighten its policy rates during the year in a bid to control growing inflation
3883809 the current downward risks in india are still mitigated by the collection of larger revenues deep domestic markets which allow it to finance large fiscal deficits without recourse to external funds and by its strong external liquidity
3883810 we will continue to own and operate industry leading companies invest in existing businesses and maintain a level of financial discipline that ensures we are well positioned for ongoing success

3883825 dat aalberts bijvoorbeeld zon klap krijgt verbaast me wel enigszins ik vond de resultaten niet zo slecht en de reactie dus wel wat overdreven dat geldt ook voor csm en als je naar ing kijkt in een goede markt zou er fors positief op de resultaten gereageerd zijn zeker als je ziet dat ze een interim dividend gaan uitkeren maar het is nu eenmaal zo dat slecht nieuws in een dalende markt vaak extra slecht valt
3883826 dat is toch wel weer heel behoorlijk maar gisteren deed het aandeel het juist erg goed terwijl de financials in amerika gisteravond flinke klappen kregen
3883827 arcelor en unilever staan hoger n wegen zwaar en dat zie je terug in het feit dat de aex het relatief veel beter doet dan de andere indices eerder toonden ook ing en shell nog een plus en dat verklaart dan meteen het feit dat de aex zelfs even positief stond
3883828 queremos expresar nuestra gratitud a la comunidad jud a por haber venido a venezuela a profundizar este di logo importante esperamos que se mantenga una relaci n permanente de contacto y conversaci n pues venezuela tal y como lo ratific el presidente ch vez es un pa s propio y dado por nuestros valores centro de una visi n ecum nica de la vida

3883830 esto es un gesto que habla sobre el liderazgo del presidente ch vez en la necesidad de terminar con todo tipo de discriminaciones en nuestra regi n
3883831 una afrenta a los principios democr ticos de los venezolanos
3883832 los alcaldes de estados unidos ven con preocupaci n los eventos que ocurren en venezuela es importante que la expresemos y mostremos nuestros apoyo a esos candidatos y a los principios democr ticos en nuestro hemisferio
3883833 nos preocupa en estos momentos lo que sucedi con el referendo constitucional del 2 de diciembre de 2007 cuando se produjo una desmovilizaci n de parte de nuestro electorado
3883834 considerando que el llamado al sufragio que estamos haciendo hoy en d a no es abstracto como fue el llamado a la reforma constitucional ste es concreto ste tendr mucha m s capacidad de movilizaci n que lo que ten a el llamado a modificar un instrumento jur dico pol tico como la constituci n nacional y especialmente con el grado de complejidad que ten a esa modificaci n de la constituci n
3883835 yo estoy convencido que mucho m s eficaz es la acci n del gobierno y sus resultados que cualquier despliegue publicitario que nosotros hagamos para vender a alg n candidato
3883836 coincidencialmente todos los sondeos de opini n sobre el caso venezolano colocan la pol tica que adelanta el presidente de la rep blica apoyado por el partido socialista unido de venezuela tiene un respaldo de la poblaci n venezolana en estos momentos de aproximadamente entre 62 y 75
3883837 con mucha convicci n podemos pensar que el 23 de noviembre de este a o el partido socialista unido de venezuela y sus candidatos obtendr n triunfos muy significativos en el ambiente electoral
3883838 esta ma ana nos reunimos el equipo t cnico de campa a que va a orientar la pol tica y la propaganda del partido socialista unido de venezuela a partir del momento en el cual se inicie la campa a electoral de acuerdo a como lo se ala la ley
3883839 ese equipo tambi n est integrado por los directores de los canales de televisi n oficiales y de la radio los expertos del gobierno en materia comunicacional participan en ese equipo el gobernador de miranda diosdado cabello el ex ministro del despacho presidencial jesse chac n y vanessa davies ellos est n encargados de hacer todo el dise o de nuestra propaganda
3883840 para la mayor a de los venezolanos las pol ticas que ha adelantado el gobierno con todos los errores que se pueden haber cometido han significado un avance en la calidad de vida para toda la poblaci n venezolana y en particular para los sectores que estaban marginados yo no pienso yo no visualizo a esos sectores votando en contra de los candidatos del partido socialista unido de venezuela
3883841 debo decir que los informes no son alentadores sobre el respeto de rusia por el alto al fuego por la promesa que formul
3883842 eso s lo servir para profundizar el aislamiento en el cual se est moviendo rusia
3883843 hay preocupantes informes de georgia de que en realidad rusia no ha cesado sus operaciones militares

3883850 with less than two weeks to go before the start of the presidential nominating conventions barack obama s lead over john mccain has disappeared
3883851 obama born just after alan shepard became the first american in space would have a hard sell to convince a board of directors at a big company that hes not unseasoned mccain would have a tougher sell as someone so seasoned that he was born before pilot amelia earhart vanished trying to circumnavigate the globe
3883852 its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy

3883865 the story here is a long sad sort of fall of a state agency a major state agency
3883866 were just not seeing the kind of results that can justify 860 000 per child per year
3883867 it raises questions about whether or not this is an agency that should be reorganized
3883868 and if we have any reluctance on the part of witnesses to testify well use the power of subpoena
3883869 were always happy to participate in the legislative activity regarding childrens issues
3883870 we will fully engage legislators in any interest they have for information and discussion
3883871 when i call her and ask her to report on something she replies to me in monosyllables her legislative liaison has not talked to me in the year 2008
3883872 i dont have this kind of a problem with the other departments we oversee
3883873 in regular contact with me it is dcf that is out there operating without wanting to allow any legislative oversight
3883874 for the purposes of opening lines of communications and to make sure that the senator has access to any information he feels is useful or of interest to him we intend to continue those efforts
3883875 a very good idea to have hearings i think we need more accountability from the department its a billion dollar agency
3883876 there needs to be a complete overhaul with intensive oversight to redo the way this institution is managed in almost every aspect if it isnt done administratively it will have to be compelled legislatively
3883877 he asked her to bring the baby over to set her up he killed my daughter
3883878 he just wanted her and if he couldnt have her he was going to end her life
3883879 you wouldnt go to jail you wouldnt be arrested but it would be more of a civil issue as opposed to a criminal issue
3883880 its a list that we think is a pretty solid list that will get some traction and that we can justify to the courts if challenged
3883881 could be all of them could be some of them could be none of them could be a combination of things
3883882 it does make you question whether this is the united states or another country
3883883 till the last biker leaves town were not going to give up
3883884 i would love to see more latinas i think they are coming weve got to be patient but soon they will be here
3883885 there are so many koreans but we have to follow their example because they are doing things very well
3883886 i can never talk about beating eric because he is my good friend

3883888 i love swimming from the time i was a kid and now i give my love for swimming
3883889 sport is universal if people are going to support me and cheer for me i will be very happy and accept it
3883890 most urgent methinks humbly is the painful legislative birth of a new texas beast the regional mobility authority now as you may remember travis and williamson counties formed a central texas rma months ago as authorized by legislation passed
3883891 but things got out of control and what the lege now has in hand is a bill converting rmas from bureaucratic devices subservient to the will of the counties that created them into highly empowered transportation superagencies
3883892 alarmed the travis co commissioners have managed to get krusees bill tweaked in a way that doesnt change the ground rules quite so drastically but the saga has spotlighted what are already uncomfortable truths about the central texas rma williamson co has four seats on the rma board while much larger and wealthier travis co whose citizens will ultimately pay much of the cost of a road in cedar park only has three and the city of austin has no designated representation at all even though us 183 a would also run well within the austin city limits as the legislation currently stands an rma can build a road in austin over the objection of city hall or austin citizens as long as that project is included in campos regional transportation plan which is hardly a safeguard as youll see
3883893 the redesignation as toll roads of roads already constructed under construction or funded through traditional means such as the gasoline tax is double taxation
3883894 the hard working middle class family doesnt read them theyre looking for solutions on fuel prices health care bringing our valiant troops home from iraq and saving social security in this race only paul kanjorski has offered answers to those dire problems weve got barletta on the run and that will be more evident in the next few days
3883895 mejorar a la situaci n socioecon mica para mejorar todas las pol ticas

3883897 sin duda el trasvase del ebro a la comunitat tendr a efectos beneficiosos en cuanto que al elevar el nivel socioecon mico de la misma nos permitir a disponer de m s fondos que no aporta el gobierno de zapatero
3883898 si la fuente de mi apellido pudiera paliar la carencia de agua de la comunitat ya me dar a por satisfecho pero hace falta el trasvase porque con ese trasvase mejorar a nuestra posici n socioecon mica y tendr amos m s dinero
3883899 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the olympic games opening ceremony and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed
3883900 i wouldnt say that between the two of us there was bad body language we are a team you cant be mad at one another we lose together we win together we are both disappointed but we will get over it
3883901 i was supposed to be there i had a right to be there
3883902 if she says her three later tests are correct then why is she contesting the first one and if she is confident of her innocence why did she not go for a b sample test
3883903 the minister heard me out and has promised an enquiry i am sure of coming out clean
3883904 i have discussed all aspects of this unfortunate incident and have decided to appoint an immediate inquiry to go into all aspects of this matter immediately so as to bring out the precise truth
3883905 i dont know what happened maybe i made a lot of mistakes i dont know
3883906 ill be much more prepared next time ill be much more experienced
3883907 i wouldnt have given up the lead i would have finished the match
3883908 cu toate acestea niveluri de dobanzi ca in aceste zile nu s au mai vazut pe piata locala de mult timp
3883909 ar insemna ca dobanda dupa care se orienteaza cele ale bancilor comerciale nu ar mai fi cea la care bnr atrage depozite de la banci ci aceea la care banca centrala imprumuta bancile ajungand in acest punct miscarile de politica monetara ale bnr deciziile in privinta dobanzii cheie sau alte masuri si ar face resimtit efectul mult mai repede pe piata
3883910 in maxim 12 luni am putea asista la situatia in care banca centrala va deveni creditor net pentru sistem acesta fiind de altfel scopul declarat al bancii nationale bnr de mai mult timp romania ar ajunge astfel la situatia in care se afla toate tarile dezvoltate
3883911 este ceea ce se intampla pe majoritatea pietelor dezvoltate si este ceva benefic desi au parut multe voci care pareau speriate de aceasta perspectiva
3883912 ne incadram in targetul propus la inceputul anului de 40 42 milioane euro
3883913 fortus nu are nevoie pentru procesul de fabricatie decat de maximum jumatate din totalul activelor restul bunurilor fie ele mobile sau imobile putand fi vandute fortus iasi are in proprietate circa 150 de hectare de teren iar pretul de vanzare este cuprins intre 150 si 200 de euro mp cu banii obtinuti se pot achita datoriile si sa se asigure un minim de capital de lucru
3883914 din punct de vedere legislativ acest lucru nu poate schimba cursul dosarului singura modificare va fi aceea de numire a unui nou administrator special din partea avas
3883915 exista multe variante pentru terenurile din cug este o suprafata care se preteaza constructiei unui complex imobiliar dar si unor activitati comerciale
3883916 exista destui dezvoltatori imobiliari si de retail care vor sa deschida business uri pe acest teren care acum costa probabil cel putin 150 200 de euro pe metru patrat daca vinde jumatate din teren cel pretabil pentru constructii se face lejer o afacere de minim 100 milioane de euro
3883917 sunt acolo 150 de hectare de teren intravilan cu toate utilitatile la indemana se vede clar care este interesul
3883918 data de 11 august 2008 a reprezentat ultimul termen pana la care metalexportimport mai putea sa si respecte clauzele si investitiile asumate prin contractul de privatizare nu a facut o iar avas are responsabilitatea viitorului acestei societati si a oamenilor de acolo aplicam legea si ne asiguram ca statul roman nu va fi prejudiciat ca urmare a acestei situatii

3884110 my arms kind of dragging a little bit today its not really sore just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised i dont want to say i feel good but that ive been able to make it through every practice so far i think maybe this afternoon im going to talk to eric mangini about limiting my throws a little bit for the afternoon practice i didnt throw the ball very well this morning no pain but im 38 years old gotta be fatigued a little bit my arm for the most part has felt great legs a little big fatigued you gotta figure im a little behind these guys like damien woody said to me this morning ive been here since the 19th of july doing all this stuff
3884111 we are stunned and profoundly saddened by this tragic loss
3884112 words are inadequate to express our sympathy for the families and loved ones of the victims and our devoted team of humanitarian aid workers in afghanistan
3884113 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
3884114 they need to be accountable and im going to make them accountable one way or another
3884115 they dont have any answer to this virus this is the only living animal ever thats beat the virus
3884116 based on medical advice it was too big a risk for people that would be looking after the horse
3884117 an inspector will be directed to carry out the order on friday
3884118 i dont think were really looking at taking any action against mr small and i need to emphasise that mr small has actually done nothing wrong
3884119 the horse is a victim of unfortunate circumstances here but it does present a risk and our priority is to remove that risk
3884120 what it will lead to is the concentration of the banking sector which will reduce competition which will reduce employment within the sector
3884121 and the bottom line that thats going to be its going to be bad for the customers and its going to be bad for bank workers
3884122 he is the person who is empowered to act in the national interest
3884123 by tunneling deep into their pasts their paranoias and anxieties their troubled romantic relationships their outsize dreams lacy delivers a sophisticated psychological study of an ascendant economic class
3884124 we get excited about playing the u s all the time
3884125 and now we get to do it in the olympics
3884126 theyre obviously one of the best teams in the world but i dont think theyre playing as well right now as they have in the past
3884127 the answer is yes were confident we can beat them
3884128 i think at this point we know the u s well and they know us
3884129 every time we play them we seem to do a little bit better
3884130 i cant think of anything better than beating them at the olympics
3884131 we kind of got away from that part of our game for a while there
3884132 but weve made a concentrated effort to be more physical
3884133 i dont know how many times she has broken her nose but she hardly even flinches thats just how she plays
3884134 i think we have them at a pretty good time
3884135 obviously it would be ideal to knock them out of the olympics and not allow them to have a chance at winning a medal
3884136 he is very strong and i felt he will not give up i used all my energy to call for help from my neighbours
3884137 i have to help myself im not ready to die without a fight and thats why the whole street far away they can hear my screaming i thought if im screaming like that hell give up
3884138 i remember he hit the bear and all the neighbours came and they tried to save my life
3884139 it was a terrible shock all i can say is thank goodness she was in the front yard
3884140 she had bites all over her body and scratch marks all over her body the main thing is shes alive i think it was pretty close for her
3884141 my family my friends are all very worried about me im lucky because i have lots of people who love me
3884142 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
3884143 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3884144 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3884145 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3884146 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3884147 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3884148 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3884149 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3884150 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3884151 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3884152 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3884153 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3884154 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3884155 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3884156 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3884157 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3884158 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3884159 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3884160 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3884161 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3884162 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3884163 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3884164 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3884165 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3884166 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3884167 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3884168 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3884169 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3884170 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3884171 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3884172 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3884173 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

3884180 take the famous ice core data this was the jewel in the crown of global warming theory al gore said it proved a link between carbon dioxide and temperature he failed to mention that in the data the connection was clearly the wrong way round temperature driving co2 levels not the other way round
3884181 but if you take all the chemistry thermal dymanics and theiries about carbon etc and take them down to basic priciples and back them up by the last hundred years of research and scientific findings then you update them with the mass of evidence from all of the recent studies if you do all this and you link to the studies the scientists and all of this is backed by facts the global warming hoax people

3884263 countrywide made loans to west virginia consumers on terms that were unaffordable and unconscionable
3884264 these loans exposed consumers to foreclosure and loss of their homes countrywide also used unfair and deceptive acts or practices to make loans and service loans

3884271 with all of the mixed messages we hear about biofuels there is a clear need for a standard that can differentiate the good from the bad
3884272 for an issue of such seminal importance it was necessary to bring many different stakeholder groups together to agree on how to define and measure sustainable biofuels
3884273 ensuring sustainability is what all these discussions are hinged upon
3884274 biofuels are one of a number of potential alternatives to fossil fuels and todays agreement allows us to initiate a stakeholder driven process that will determine their value right across the production process from field or forest to tank

3884279 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3884280 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3884281 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3884282 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3884283 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery

3884297 there are very few egg donors in ireland so women who have tried one or two ivf treatments with their own eggs and failed will come here for donor eggs
3884298 plus we can offer anonymity so the child born from a donated egg cant come looking for the donor 18 years later
3884299 theres no legislation and there is no incentive for women to donate
3884300 we are working in a legal vacuum where the parenthood of these children is concerned so we dont offer egg donations but generally send people to spain where they get good results
3884301 donating eggs is a complicated and time consuming procedure the donor has to go through a complicated drug regime and invasive procedure to get the eggs out and theres a danger to all procedures so thats probably a deterrent for irishwomen
3884302 they usually stay for a holiday for a week and take in prague and vienna
3884303 they come to our clinic because the waiting list is only two months and they can have a vacation at the same time
3884304 most greek people have brown hair and blue eyes although they can be a bit darker than the irish
3884305 but the irish couples say they dont care if their children look different to them because they have been waiting for a child for many years
3884306 i would suggest that anyone going to a clinic abroad ask where the eggs are sourced from it would upset me if any of these women were being exploited

3884308 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3884309 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3884310 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3884311 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

3884313 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3884314 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3884315 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3884316 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3884317 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3884318 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3884319 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3884320 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3884321 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3884322 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3884323 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3884324 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3884325 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake

3884330 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3884331 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now

3884345 it is extraordinarily disappointing that after our board unequivocally rejected costars 8 75 proposal costar has seen fit to come back with exactly the same proposal in a hostile fashion to judge the value of our company by the daily trading prices of its relatively illiquid common stock makes no sense we trust that our clear second rejection of costars offer will prompt costar to withdraw it our board will of course review carefully any serious proposal from any responsible third party

3884367 i have some fond memories of forest oaks but im glad to be here the golf course is fantastic i think its going to be better for the tournament and wyndham and everybody involved
3884368 its playing firm and fast right now lot of 3 woods and irons off tees which we dont see a whole lot on tour anymore its a different kind of golf course from forest oaks
3884369 the green complexes are difficult a lot of slope and the greens require a lot of imagination its something that suits my game to a t and i love donald ross golf courses i love old traditional golf courses could not have asked for a better venue
3884370 you do have to learn its not a driver on every hole especially for half the field
3884371 theyll be hitting some other clubs off the tees which i like the way the fairways are sloped and the way they gather in certain areas youll have a lot of guys hitting the same shots from the same spots in the fairways which i like a lot too
3884372 it will take us probably by the end of the week to really figure out the greens as far as you look and see where the pin is but you dont really know the slopes until you hit the shot
3884373 it will take awhile and obviously whoever figures that out best will play the best
3884374 its great to be moving to a traditional golf course
3884375 so many times in my career weve left a classic traditional golf course and gone to a new modern style course so its nice to be doing the opposite for once and they did a wonderful job with the renovation
3884376 i wish one day you would tell me you have some secret real loving feelings for me instead of just the sex talk all the time i have never let anyone use me like i let you i know i am worth more than just sex yet i always crawl back to you each and every time you are my weakness should i forgive myself for letting someone blatantly take advantage of me
3884377 there are many electronic certificate of analysis standards published but none are as robust as the rosettanet pip partner interface process air products was not able to use any of the existing certificate of analysis standards without major modifications which made any possible economies of scale impossible
3884378 the rosettanet pip for ecofa provides the full data set required by our customers with no additional modifications the rosettanet pip also uses a reference table which lists the characteristic parameter codes to be used when implementing the pip allowing the trading partners to maintain a single reference table in their enterprise systems and eliminating maintenance costs no other certificate of analysis standard incorporates this approach
3884379 this rosettanet electronic certificate of analysis program is just another example of the power of collaboration rosettanet provided the environment for this diverse team of companies to come together and create an innovative solution to a common business challenge we now have a solution that is standardized cost efficient and has improved the supply chain communication between business partners
3884380 everyone shares in these benefits and as this new standard is proliferated the savings will be exponential across the industry
3884381 our member companies create and implement streamlined business processes to operate the most efficient supply chains in the high tech industry the electronic certificate of analysis standard is a direct result of this expertise
3884382 the electronic certificate of analysis can be used by any industry that needs a secure standard way to transmit information on material contents and their purity to another trading partner

3884396 no permitir n ning n avasallamiento de parte del gobierno ni otro sectores por su legitimidad sindical
3884397 por el momento pareciera que el gobierno est jugando un papel bastante sucio porque est descabezando al movimiento obrero y huanuni se ha caracterizado por ser la vanguardia en las luchas sindicales por esa raz n no se debe ingresar al juego del gobierno
3884398 yo entiendo a los compa eros que se encuentran dolidos por la muerte de nuestros compa eros mineros en caihuasi que fue por culpa del gobierno pero no se tiene que poner a un lado a nuestras entes matrices a nuestros dirigentes porque eso es lo que quiere el gobierno es decir dividir al movimiento obrero para reinar

3884409 what was that original experience or spark that initiated your concern for the environment
3884410 two commonly held views on the question of when a pregnancy begins
3884411 49 percent of americans believe that human life begins at conception
3884412 dismissing medical experts and opting instead to accept a definition of pregnancy based on polling data
3884413 at some biologically unknowable moment theres no test to determine if a womans egg has been fertilized under these new standards there would be no way for a woman to prove shes not pregnant thus any woman could be denied contraception under hhs new science
3884414 up to its old tricks again quietly putting ideology before science and womens health we cant let them get away with this underhanded move to undermine womens health and thats why i am sounding the alarm
3884415 concerns for non violence sustainable development justice and peace and care for our environment are of vital importance for humanity

3884421 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart

3884427 it is not every day that 1 600 of your fellow compatriots are killed in cold blood
3884428 i think that its too early to make any final judgments because we are talking about a complicated situation
3884429 the aggressor has been punished and his military forces routed
3884430 i think russia is getting more nationalistic and i think its been strengthened in this reasserting of sovereignty

3884434 of course we all have our own preferences when it comes to our children
3884435 but i thought it would be cool to share with you some of my favorite items that i have in my nursery
3884436 the true test comes when my son actually arrives and i have a chance to put all this stuff to use
3884437 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
3884438 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face

3884446 she told him in no uncertain terms that he had to put a non use of force pledge on the table
3884447 the question will be the degree to which folks discern a racially charged attack here
3884448 beg your pardon im just here for the laughs too yall crack me up every day
3884449 what exactly is the difference between implicit and explicit messages
3884450 jesse helms for example charged in 1984 that his democratic opponent in the north carolina senatorial contest harvey gantt was colluding with jesse jackson to register hundreds of thousands of black
3884451 we must define an implicitly racial appeal as one that contains a recognizable if subtle racial reference most easily through visual references
3884452 so yes mccain or the tennessee gop makes a reference to kilpatrick whose connections to obama are thin and we can look to an implicit negative messaging as the root cause and call it what it is playing the race card
3884453 white voters respond to implicitly racial messages when two contradictory conditions hold
3884454 today these conditions hold for most republican politicians and for many arguably most white voters the contradiction among these conditions can be resolved most effectively through implicit racial communication in fact the racial reference in an implicit message while subtle is recognizable and works most powerfully through white voters racial stereotypes fears and resentments
3884455 calling him naive which is southern racial code for boy when referring to black males
3884456 you put him in a commercial that has a white girl in it thats racist
3884457 beware of obama because he will fuck the living shit out of your white daughters
3884458 you put him in a commercial with a black guy in it thats racist
3884459 look theres kwame kilpatrick shaking hands with obama they must be friends isnt that the guy whos got like 10 felony charges against him and just got out of jail boy obama must do that too
3884460 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3884461 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3884462 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3884463 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3884464 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3884465 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3884466 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3884467 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy

3884478 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real

3884482 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3884483 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3884484 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3884485 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3884486 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3884487 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3884488 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3884489 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3884490 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3884491 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss

3884497 she was saying that somebody was in her office shooting a gun and she didnt know if he had been hit
3884498 she was just screaming so we got her behind the counter and locked the door because we didnt know if someone was following her
3884499 he kept saying he needed to see the chairman and then just went around her and started shooting
3884500 she said he didnt scare me he was puzzling to me for some reason and i was trying to get rid of him
3884501 im changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood people grow mentally and spiritually through life experiences
3884502 when you come from hip hop its almost impossible to move past the stereotypes associated with it
3884503 ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry
3884504 there are a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the businessman

3884507 we will work together to reinvigorate the air forces institutions and show ourselves completely worthy of americas trust
3884508 the airmen want to see need to see and want to hear from the chief of staff

3884511 i believe the convention itself will be the unifying moment
3884512 the decision is so detailed and tight that it is going to be hard for a future court to backtrack on it
3884513 this really could end up being a positive for gun control
3884514 nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms
3884515 once he knows ive denounced him im an open target
3884516 the answer will only come from the bottom if civil society doesnt move the authorities wont move
3884517 we have to wake up the people must come on board if security is to return to mexico
3884518 the fear of reprisal is enough to keep anyone from denouncing police corruption even police chiefs are afraid to act for fear that they will be killed
3884519 the answer is not with the police they have demonstrated collusion with organized crime and kidnappings for this reason we must break with the fear thousands of us must march to show that we are not afraid
3884520 society demands that we succeed in this challenge that we end police corruption
3884521 it can create very bad punitive policies without dealing with the real source of crime
3884522 this program would be a step in the right direction but the best use of resources would be in providing better training and accountability in the police force instead of just putting civilians in their place
3884523 if i am persistent enough they may start an inquiry and if im very lucky they would detain him but in the end theyd release him and it would all be forgotten hed be policing my neighborhood a week later what kind of position would that put me in
3884524 citizens dont report crimes because they know nothing will happen
3884525 you have to go wait in line you dont get treated well and most likely it will be for nothing
3884526 if their function is to be vigilant it can work but the risk is that they are used by the government for political expression
3884527 they need to be serving the community not the government
3884528 i was supposed to be in the pilot and then i had daughter stella when they went back into production so it didnt work out but im hoping to return later in the season
3884529 there is a mental illness issue that i have to investigate
3884530 he doesnt deserve you you need to find a better man
3884531 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
3884532 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3884533 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3884534 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3884535 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
3884536 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
3884537 he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
3884538 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3884539 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3884540 i cannot confirm any such rumour at this time although i am a huge fan of qts and would love to work with him at some point i have received no official offer at this point
3884541 its been a difficult job just keeping track of all the people that are willing to sign up
3884542 the excitement is just i guess not surprising but at a really high level already at such an early date in the campaign
3884543 weve been doing phone banks its like we dont have enough phones
3884544 my perspective on the grassroots movement is basically to be a good soldier in this process take what it is i receive from campaign management and to be a facilitator to distribute the information we receive throughout the grassroots organizations
3884545 we are going to have more than 450 obama organizing teams in wisconsin
3884546 this is unprecedented its something the state has never seen before
3884547 our obama organizing teams will be owning a piece of the campaign
3884548 this approach does not rely on paid staff to do the work what it does is allow the paid staff to find recruit train and empower the enthusiastic workers we already have
3884549 who have issues that fit directly with the john mccain message and people from those coalitions are coming in and wanting to also participate in that local level and help us out
3884550 we have a network pretty well structured thats running all the time so its been pretty easy to ramp up from prior years of bush cheney and green for governor campaigns to have people in the field that are experienced
3884551 in my mind its been really easy ramp up in a very short period of time to work on the fall campaign
3884552 this is not the republican party of 2006 and the false impression that we dont take advantage of the internet and social media is just that
3884553 in my private business i focus on helping people leverage the internet for marketing and sales and you can believe were taking advantage of the best of technology in order to help this grassroots team not only have all the information they need to campaign effectively but to facilitate communication around troubleshooting and so forth
3884554 theres a great likelihood that whichever candidate wins wisconsin will likely win the presidency
3884555 wisconsins votes are a vitally important part of securing that 270 to win the presidency and were going to fight very hard with a huge operation
3884556 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with tony parker
3884557 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call
3884558 were going to eventually make a 24 movie one day if fans are still interested by then
3884559 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
3884560 so we all agreed to preserve the series just to focus on that and then when the series is done we would embark on the film
3884561 i actually wrote a song for my new album called my baby its a real beautiful song
3884562 mendeley goes public and gets some love from ex skype and last fm
3884563 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
3884564 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage
3884565 however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
3884566 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers
3884567 soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it
3884568 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3884569 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3884570 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3884571 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3884572 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3884573 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3884574 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3884575 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3884576 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3884577 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3884578 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3884579 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3884580 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3884581 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3884582 im proud that i am georgian and they hate us because we are georgian
3884583 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3884584 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3884585 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3884586 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3884587 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3884588 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3884589 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3884590 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper
3884591 the strategic assets of countries with oil are becoming more and more important
3884592 now putin wants to show the west that he also can show the west its limits
3884593 i jumped out of my car and saw bodies in the streets
3884594 wherever i saw a body moving i helped carry them to a car to drive them to the hospital
3884595 there is no religion in the world that accepts such acts
3884596 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
3884597 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists
3884598 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3884599 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3884600 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department web
3884601 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3884602 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3884603 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3884604 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3884605 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3884606 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3884607 the main objective is to bring palestinians and lebanese as well as lebanese from different backgrounds together
3884608 sport brings people together and has the potential to cross boundaries and open new dialogue
3884609 they the palestinians go to separate schools in the camps and they dont often leave the camps
3884610 at first they did not want to play each other
3884611 the two teams were about to start fighting the lebanese kids thought the palestinians were monsters but after playing for a while they discovered that the others were just like them
3884612 they were often nervous in the beginning of every practice but after a while of playing they feel better and they start thinking about other things not just the fighting
3884613 the teams are from all different backgrounds religiously and socially
3884614 the recent fighting in beirut and tripoli did not affect the composition of the teams they still play together on mixed teams
3884615 usually the coaches go around and do training with the teams in their regions and select the players
3884616 but now right to play has been able to coordinate and arrange this tournament where they can all play each other
3884617 it was not so easy to get some children here because of the security situation parents were reluctant
3884618 the situation between bab al tabbaneh and jabal mohsen is still tense fighting has happened before but it was never this fierce
3884619 this soccer tournament will keep the children away from the fighting
3884620 we dont just teach them the right to play but also fair play
3884621 i made some friends and we learn from each other
3884622 the eu warns the military junta that the country faces the serious risk of long lasting isolation from the international scene
3884623 reiterates with the greatest firmness its condemnation of the coup that took place in mauritania
3884624 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
3884625 its part of the string of attacks against the lebanese army
3884626 the army has been a target for a while now whats worrying is the quality and the ferocity of the attack
3884627 in my opinion i dont think there actually is any connection between what happened in tripoli and the visit
3884628 of course we can draw a certain thin line between what is taking place in ain al hilweh and in tripoli
3884629 tripoli is open open for all troubles of the islamic extremism even before nahr al bared and after
3884630 all these remnants of the extremist people who fought there in nahr al bared and who are still alert to fight still of course belong to that faction
3884631 i personally do not find that connecting link between wednesdays event and the visit
3884632 was the main architect of the doha agreement he declared half of this government is a friend of syria
3884633 the balance of power is not in the lebanese favor
3884634 whatever happens syria will have the upper hand it doesnt matter who the culprit is
3884635 there are two explosive points in lebanon and i am afraid these will not be pacified peacefully
3884636 the first explosive point is tripoli and the second explosive point is ain al hilweh
3884637 what happened in the mediation in doha was just a transitory and superficial deal
3884638 it is like a paralyzed country from a military point of view security point of view
3884639 everybody was discussing the state of the government for more than a month how can you work effectively at the intelligence level
3884640 if you want to deter these people you need intelligence all of this is about intelligence and in intelligence you need to have control first and you dont have it
3884641 there were reports about the presence of arab turkmen and local militants
3884642 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
3884643 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdel rahman and one of their close relatives abdel salam were killed in the strike
3884644 the secretary general condemns the bombing that took place this morning in the northern lebanese city of tripoli
3884645 believes this attack should not hinder the positive steps that have been taken to return the country to normalcy
3884646 against the hands that try to mess with its security and stability
3884647 syria strongly denounces the criminal act perpetrated this morning in tripoli that killed many innocent civilians
3884648 syria expresses its regrets and condolences to the families of the victims and affirms its sympathy and solidarity with brotherly lebanon in the face of all those who are manipulating its security and stability
3884649 the president of the republic condemns in the strongest terms the hateful and cowardly attack that cost the lives of many lebanese citizens most of them soldiers this morning in tripoli
3884650 reaffirms frances unfailing support for lebanon its authorities and its security institutions in their fight against terrorism
3884651 reaffirms his full support for the process under way and his determined commitment in favor of peace and stability in the region
3884652 underscores the importance of bringing all arms in lebanon under the control of the institutions of the state
3884653 the presidency of the european union condemns in the strongest terms the attack that occurred this morning in tripoli
3884654 full light must be shed on this terrorist act the presidency of the european union reaffirms its commitment to support lebanon and the lebanese people in their fight against terrorism
3884655 we will continue to take full part in efforts to promote the security and unity of lebanon which are essential to the stability of the region
3884656 the kingdom strongly condemns this abhorrent terrorist crime which targeted the security and political stability at a time when the brotherly people of lebanon strives to end its ordeal and strengthen reconciliation and national unity
3884657 the story of our people is your story mahmoud and by our meeting it was made more complete and more beautiful
3884658 you remain with us mahmoud because you represent everything that unites us
3884659 the flag he raised so high with his poems will one day fly high over the minarets of jerusalem its churches and walls the eternal capital of our inevitable palestinian state
3884660 darwish was always a symbol of the palestinian cause he exposed our suffering to the world
3884661 this land absorbs the skins of martyrs this land promises wheat and stars worship it we are its salt and its water we are its wound but a wound that fights
3884662 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3884663 we were appealing to everybody in the international community including russia saying stop that unfortunately no help came
3884664 three females foreign nationals and an afghan male have been killed
3884665 they were in a two vehicle convoy they were american canadian and irish
3884666 they were driving in a land cruiser with a clear irc logo on it
3884667 there were signs of about 10 bullets on the vehicle but more bullets on the bodies of the victims they were hit by dozens of bullets
3884668 we dont know yet how many men carried out the attack
3884669 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
3884670 so far this year 19 ngo staff have been killed which already exceeds the total number of ngo workers killed last year
3884671 reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted in this way
3884672 this is a senseless act of murder which is morally indefensible
3884673 this highlights the deterioration in security conditions which are worse than at any point since 2001
3884674 the two presidents decided to establish diplomatic ties at the level of ambassadors in line with the treaty of the united nations and international law
3884675 instructed their foreign ministries to take the necessary measures in this regard to conform with the laws of the two countries
3884676 assad has instructed all concerned syrian officials that he wants this visit to be successful and fruitful
3884677 the visit is a starting point for future relations we hope it will yield good relations in the interests
3884678 syria wants a stable united and arab lebanon which does not serve as a trampoline for hostile activities
3884679 relations between syrian and lebanon must be based on mutual respect both states should vow not to interfere in each others domestic affairs
3884680 the militants believe the shiite officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the us
3884681 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
3884682 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shiite especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
3884683 if the us launches an assault on iran ill be the first volunteer to fight on the side of the us
3884684 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council and the dawa party
3884685 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
3884686 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
3884687 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
3884688 the iraqi government gives 5 million per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province
3884689 we dont have a representative government here or in baghdad because of the heavy iranian influence
3884690 that influence favors only those who support them and hurts those of us who do not
3884691 the badr militia and their political and religious leaders entered iraq on the backs of the us tanks
3884692 until the americans came there was no way they badr and iranian backed politicians and clerics could set foot in iraq
3884693 the lebanese army and security forces will not surrender to any criminal acts
3884694 as a crucial step to stopping them from reaching further ends
3884695 honesty and reconciliation among the lebanese will strengthen their unity and allow them to stand against terrorism that only benefits israel
3884696 the best way to combat terrorism is to abolish it before it spreads some want the security situation to explode but it will not because the lebanese do not want to fight
3884697 it is normal to condemn the explosion but what is the use after the victims were killed
3884698 political agreements do not eliminate the chances for disagreements but i reassure the lebanese that strife will not spread
3884699 a dangerous aggression that should push the government into granting the lebanese army the right to gather weapons from all parties
3884700 i call on all parties to unite behind the lebanese army and security services to face these terrorist activities and to protect north lebanon and the city of tripoli
3884701 are the targets of an ongoing plot that includes previous terrorist crimes across the country
3884702 but we will fight this plot against lebanon its people and institutions
3884703 and i call on the president to protect the citizens of tripoli
3884704 cowards and they will pay the price for their actions
3884705 calls on political factions in tripoli to stay united and to back the lebanese army and security services
3884706 which made huge sacrifices to preserve unity stability and freedom in lebanon will not fear the crime
3884707 the army is now stronger and will fight terrorism and convict the criminals wherever they are
3884708 we will wait for the results of the investigation because unlike the previous times there is no clear evidence and the event is ambiguous
3884709 all leaders must uncover any person related to this crime no matter their political affiliation
3884710 this explosion was meant to boost the age old conspiracy of sustaining violence in the north
3884711 the implementation of definite and serious security measures in tripoli instead of temporary settlements
3884712 any effort to tie the two events together would be negative
3884713 could annoy certain groups which is why some are trying hard to create insecurity and instability in lebanon
3884714 a renewed conspiracy to destabilize the security in tripoli especially after the repeated attempts to retain stability
3884715 this is a terrorist message and a security breach that must be dealt with on the political and security levels
3884716 this is why practical measures must be adopted and radical changes must be made to prevent further crimes of this nature
3884717 a plot aimed at undermining confidence in the military institution and its ability to combat terrorism
3884718 undermining civil peace which is to be consolidated through cooperation and consensus
3884719 of course i will cut the mobile rates as i explained before this issue requires some time to study it thoroughly this will be done in the appropriate time and i am committed to do it during the term of this government
3884720 the lebanese must understand that the rates or tariffs of mobile phones in lebanon are partly commercial and partly taxes
3884721 we made it very clear that we are committed to the privatization of the cellular networks in accordance with the lebanese laws and international criteria
3884722 the company informed us that it has complied with the decision finally however we are waiting if the company will compensate the subscribers who made international calls at the old rates
3884723 this is not the first time we are threatened by violence but we are determined not to bow to threats
3884724 however national unity remains our most effective weapon in the face of lebanons enemies
3884725 todays crime proved that we were right when we decided to overcome unpleasant past experiences and achieve national unity
3884726 when we are united we can better face the enemies of lebanon
3884727 one body in the face of terrorism which only serves israels interests
3884728 criminals do not want us to make a fresh start they want to maintain a state of tension in lebanon
3884729 while we were honoring 12 outstanding students for their academic achievements we leaned that a criminal hand has extended to hit tripoli
3884730 but we will continue our ceremony and make it clear to everyone that we have a will to life
3884731 the vote of confidence is the first step toward restoring stability in lebanon it is also the first step toward building balanced relations between lebanon and its arab brothers namely syria
3884732 president michel sleiman will head to syria today to meet syrian president bashar assad in a bid to establish exemplary ties between lebanon and syria in the meantime the tripoli crime came to tell us that lebanons enemies want the tension to continue
3884733 we are now in agreement with the french to completely restructure the national airline now that we have an agreement to buy airbus planes dardari said however he declined to specify an order value or a breakdown by model
3884734 we are in discussions habib fekih airbuss president for the middle east said in a telephone interview
3884735 we didnt finish the review yet and are working on the final details and their requirements over the coming years
3884736 i dont think the us has managed to dampen foreign direct investment nor have they succeeded in stopping economic reforms and liberalization dardari said
3884737 our main concern today is that state owned industry and construction companies require a complete overhaul and need to stand on their feet in an open economy dardari said
3884738 they are no longer monopolies and thats why they arent making a profit and are facing very tough private sector competition
3884739 mr mashaie does not have the right to take such a disgraceful stance and he is not competent to hold such a responsibility
3884740 condemning this regretful position we deputies ask dr ahmadinejad to deal with him seriously
3884741 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
3884742 not all the israeli people are wearing military boots on the street
3884743 mr mashaie probably does not know that those he calls people israelis are the same occupiers of houses of millions of palestinians
3884744 these people have created the illegitimate zionist regime we do not recognize a land called israel let alone recognize its people
3884745 they know very well that this is their last redoubt
3884746 we expect the battle will be a battle of roadside bombs explosive belts and a battle of explosions
3884747 so far there is no deal made talks are going on between the two governments regarding the presence of this brigade in the area
3884748 what we are doing at the moment is sending a signal that the un is back the un is back to stay the un is back to have its footprint increasing
3884749 all these areas we controlled since 2003 but now they are coming and attacking and now they are in the control of the government
3884750 they are readying to move to other places the government is cheating us and cheating the international community they are going to destroy all the places to control them
3884751 civilians in that area have fled government soldiers are shooting randomly in the area civilians have been killed and are missing some fled
3884752 government forces and arab militia are moving north the government is conducting the second round of ethnic cleansing in northern darfur i call on the international community to stop the killing of civilians
3884753 the terrorist explosion directly targets the army and peaceful co existence in the country
3884754 the army and security forces will not be terrorized by attacks and crimes that target it and civil society and the history of the army attests to that
3884755 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make her hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3884756 wont a single tape of the rev jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3884757 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values he told the people of nh yesterday he has a kansas accent because his mother was from there his mother lived in many states as far as we can tell but this is an example of the nonsense he uses to cover this up
3884758 oh yeah i just got back from egypt no big deal
3884759 i want to take these things you know and flip them which is something ive always enjoyed in hip hop
3884760 in a time when more and more families are uninsured and feeling the financial strain of a bad economy its pretty incredible that the bush administration is actually trying to put up roadblocks for women trying to access basic health care
3884761 and will be fighting to preserve womens access to health care information
3884762 maybe you should call him and let him know about the birth
3884763 oh wait maybe that was wrong of me or maybe i shouldnt have done that
3884764 accoccolati ad ascoltare il mare quanto tempo siamo stati senza fiatare
3884765 sorry the time difference is messing up my schedule ill call you tomorrow xox
3884766 found that the self reported health status of never married adults increased significantly over time at the same time the self reported health status of married women also increased so the gap between married and never married womens health stayed about the same however never married men narrowed the health gap between themselves and married men
3884767 you are a human being this is where you belong so dont give up and pull have the hope to pull yourself out and dont listen to the voices from below
3884768 as jesus and his disciples were on their way he came to a village where a woman named martha opened her home to him
3884769 lord dont you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself tell her to help me
3884770 you are worried and upset about many things but only one thing is needed mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her
3884771 and any other gender specific words with their respective opposites and we can easily avoid any confusion here
3884772 hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength love your neighbor as yourself there is no commandment greater than these
3884773 aqu nos quedamos seguiremos en la lucha hasta que nos asignen una vivienda vamos a actuar por la v a legal

3884816 idea people seldom recognize boundaries between personal and professional lifestyles they seek style authenticity and craft whether at home or at the office coalesse opens the office door to the higher degrees of expression and comfort we have at home more than a new brand it is a new way of enlightening workplaces to inspire and reward ideas with selections that fit as naturally in the office as the living room
3884817 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3884818 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3884819 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3884820 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3884821 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
3884822 the in situ process produces a 700 degree hydrocarbon vapor and as it cools it condenses and the products the liquids are diesel jet fuel naptha and natural gas

3884824 energy in versus energy out balance is still not understood
3884825 we dont have hard and fast numbers that we can talk about on a commercial scale but we believe that eventually we will have a positive energy balance we are not going to waste our time on something that we dont think will work out
3884826 were just situating ourselves so that when the time comes well have the resources we need

3884837 between one candidate john mccain who has always put his country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate that has not
3884838 joe lieberman has said things that are totally irresponsible when it comes to barack obama here we have a leader for the future really a great leader for the future and one that comes along only every now and then and they know it so they have to undermine him and one of their best weapons of course is someone who is considered by some to be a democrat
3884839 the democrats in the senate are in a tough spot they have 51 votes joe lieberman organizes with them
3884840 in 85 days or something they will have five more democrats they wont need him to make the majority and it will be interesting to see what the leadership in the senate the democratic leadership in the senate does at that point in terms of joe liebermans chairmanship of his committee

3884844 russia denying us rides or charging exorbitant amounts for them
3884845 it was a tough sell before but it was doable simply because we didnt have a choice we dont want to deny ourselves access to the space station the very place we have built and paid
3884846 its going to be a tougher sell now unless there are critical developments during the next 48 to 72 hours

3884857 i would say were very supportive of seeing whether the city might have some money to buy some small part of this if the land were available but then thered be the question of where the money for park development would come from
3884858 weve been burned before when they say one thing and do another
3884859 our concern is that the decision has already been made that the intention is that this the denny site will be more of the athletic center more citywide fields that dont truly serve the local schools and the community
3884860 im not cynical enough yet at the 8 month mark of my term to believe its all been decided
3884861 i think the rhode island republican party is an underdog and i think we need to accept were an underdog
3884862 against the tide how a compliant congress empowered a reckless president
3884863 i think voters are finally putting the blame on where its really due on the democratically controlled general assembly
3884864 i dont think that helps the party at all with him at the head
3884865 the republicans are supposed to be the ones who know how to run a budget
3884866 there is no current risk from these underground tanks to our drinking water
3884867 to induce a station to become the key ebs station in the area the government would provide a hardened concrete bunker equipment such as turntables and audio control boards an emergency generator and the standard thing in the 60s and 70s was to provide an underground fuel storage tank

3884872 hes a good athlete it aint on t o though
3884873 first of all t o is 10 times faster than brandon marshall and 10 times stronger than brandon marshall
3884874 you can sometimes get your hand on b at the line t o has a good thing where he snatches and whips i wouldnt say hes nowhere near t o
3884875 if you compare him five six years from now then its a comparison you cant compare them right now t o s one of the top receivers in the league consistently for a reason the guys got tremendous work habits
3884876 hes a big receiver hes very aggressive hell go get the ball and he can make things happen once he gets the ball in his hands
3884877 they have a good guy in brandon hes going to be a guy that will be around here for a while
3884878 and thats some of the problems that we have with sports is just because a guy can run jump and catch its oh he can be this he can be that the 6 inches the muscle between your ears is the most important one

3884882 it is not a beginner level ultra and participation in the race should not be taken lightly
3884883 the pikes peak ascent and pikes peak marathon will redefine what you call running sure they start out like a lot of races on any street usa but your first left turn will have you turning in the direction of up during the next 10 miles as you gain almost 6 000 vertical feet your legs lungs heart and mind will be worn to a ragged nothingness but it wont be until your last three miles with still over 2 000 of vertical to go that you will realize where the marathon got its ultimate challenge theres a reason trees dont bother growing above 12 000 on pikes peak they cant makes one wonder if trees are smarter than runners above treeline most runners take 30 minutes or more some much more just to cover a mile what little air remains cant satisfy the endless stream of zombies hoping only to survive their next step a death march right out of a scene from dawn of the dead adding insult to injury it might start to snow then if you are on the deluxe tour you run back down for the second half of the marathon along the way protruding rocks are waiting to send you crashing to the ground mangling flesh and only temporarily masking the pain of blood filled blisters meanwhile the temperature has often risen by more than 30 degrees since the race start after all its always best to cook raw meat
3884884 indeed the possibility of lightning poses the single greatest threat to runners especially above treeline mother nature is very unpredictable regarding this element if you are caught in severe lightning it is best for a group to spread out and crouch down with your feet planted on anything that will insulate you from the ground jacket fanny pack etc try not to be the tallest object in the vicinity
3884885 when the ferry street bridge went down we had to realign some of our priorities at that time and state street had to be pushed out
3884886 the state street bridge had started design in 2000 and through a long period of time we worked at getting it into a position where its ready to go
3884887 you have a design done you get it obligated you get it advertised you get it built all of those aspects take time

3884915 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3884916 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3884917 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3884918 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3884919 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3884920 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3884921 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3884922 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3884923 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3884924 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3884925 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3884926 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3884927 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3884928 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3884982 theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
3884983 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units and auctioned off
3884984 this legislation accomplished two important goals providing confidence in the immediate term as these institutions play a critical role in weathering the housing correction and putting in place a new regulator with all the authorities necessary to address systemic risk posed by the gses
3884985 this was the ideal opportunity to come to grips with what is a fundamentally flawed model which privatizes profits and socializes losses that is fiscally tolerable in small amounts but in trillions of dollars it isnt
3884986 if they are too big to fail make them smaller
3884987 the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping
3884988 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
3884989 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3884990 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis
3884991 stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
3884992 its hard to escape the conclusion that at some point our extraordinary housing boom cannot continue indefinitely into the future
3884993 while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity

3885003 i know i know its excessive but i was thinking
3885004 this program was implemented as a means to keep these kids busy and out of trouble as well as to give them a sense of citizenship and teach them about the importance of why they need to keep their environment clean
3885005 this program keeps them busy and makes them some money
3885006 i think the parents love it because all the kids are actually out doing something together working toward community goals and leaving their differences aside forming a good community
3885007 i would like to see this as a success story and implemented throughout iraq in future years to come
3885008 i just needed closure and thought if i looked at monicas pictures it would help me realize that my man once hurt someone else before me
3885009 without forgiveness life is governed by an endless cycle of resentment and retaliation
3885010 does it matter at least we have one ordered now
3885011 ive been told oldest ever female olympian of any nation of all time
3885012 im just still kicking and im not putting any restrictions on myself it doesnt say i have to stop at a certain age
3885013 im not ruling anything out i still feel good and i still have that competitive fire in me
3885014 what ive probably done in a lot of areas is that ive tried too hard
3885015 i shoot great technique ive been told this not just by u s coaches but other international coaches its just somethings happening just a few times in a match that throws me out of some competitions thats a mental thing and you know the brain the mind is a terrible thing
3885016 you still have to have the same mental approach have to have the same techniques to execute the shot
3885017 there may be a different perspective in maybe somebody who is younger or hasnt been here before but thats just all part of experience just having general experience in life
3885018 throughout shooting you will find that some things work at a certain period of time and then after a while it doesnt work any more
3885019 im way more advanced than i was when i first started shooting
3885020 but its some mental things that really grab me at certain times and it hurts me in the match
3885021 some days youre really good some days youre really bad and some days youre mediocre
3885022 thats what makes shooting interesting and i guess challenging you can shoot a perfect score and the next day go out and you arent diddly squat
3885023 a man riding a trimet bus monday threatened to kill the driver and later punched a hole in a bus window a passenger said
3885024 he threatened her showed her some sort of gang signs and said do you know what this means he said he was going to kill her
3885025 i gave the bus driver my name and phone number and said im going to go follow this guy so i can keep an eye on where hes going
3885026 we continue to take criminals off the streets to provide a safer and more secure environment for the iraqi citizens
3885027 we expect that russia will respect the humanitarian nature of that mission and that ports sea lanes air routes will all be open for humanitarian purposes another pledge that russia has undertaken to the french
3885028 there are plans for another flight tomorrow as we continue to assess the wide range of humanitarian assistance options that we might be able to provide both in the immediate and long term humanitarian capabilities
3885029 i am going first to meet with the french president and other members of the french government in france
3885030 and then i will fly on to tbilisi to underscore the strong support of the united states for the georgian people and for their democratically elected government
3885031 terrorists are attempting to intimidate local citizens in this area to dissuade them from supporting the iraqi security and coalition forces
3885032 within a week of their arrival the government of iraq launched the charge of the knights operation to restore the rule of law here in basra multi national division south east is key to supporting the operation through partnership with the iraqi security forces
3885033 let me thank the leaders and the people of basra
3885034 basra now stands poised to be the economic miracle of the gulf with the security forces provided by the iraqi security forces it will soon rival dubai or bahrain
3885035 iraq its government and its people will remember the efforts that have been made for some time with respect and appreciation
3885036 in my name and your local ip sons names we are promising god and our country to protect our citizens respect and obey the law and stop all the violations
3885037 the ip station has been functioning for the past four months but has not been recognized by the government of iraq until today
3885038 the iraqis now have a local police force to protect the people and handle the routine activities and business related to security here in radwaniyah
3885039 this opening today is great and it marks a new beginning for the government of iraq and the people of radwaniyah
3885040 we have a very tight bond with the people of radwaniyah the tribal support council and the u s army and coalition forces work hand in hand to provide security for this area
3885041 the radwaniyah security forces of the rashid district worked with the good people of radwaniyah to achieve sustainable security and we see that here today with the opening of the police station
3885042 the reduction in violence did not just come as a gift
3885043 the soi members keep demanding jobs with the iraqi security forces because that will solve the problem with unemployment
3885044 i think it makes sense to bring sons of iraq into the security forces because its a force for stability
3885045 the employment advantages are obvious but also if you have volunteers that only strengthens the security forces
3885046 from a policy perspective we dont want to see any delay
3885047 iraq is a new enough democracy that they need practice in elections another reason is we had seen the sunnis sit out the 2005 elections so its important that this go around they participate and that all of the people of iraq participate
3885048 my very strong impression not just from this trip but in other visits is that people are dissatisfied with the performance of the local governments and want to address that through the elections
3885049 part of voter turnout will depend on the quality of the candidates if they are attractive candidates with attractive platforms it will lead to a greater voter turnout
3885050 there is so much overlap in finding solutions to problems its no longer as discrete as it once was
3885051 civil military or diplomatic military cooperation is essential and its the wave of the future
3885052 my sense is that the iraqi government is not spending money quickly
3885053 i would think there would be more effort to fund programs
3885054 its always a danger to analyze things in the middle east using america as a context
3885055 iraqi army soldiers continue to scour the area to seize these dangerous weapons
3885056 this taking of responsibility in lutifiyah shows that the iraqi army is ready to protect that the iraqi army is ready to fight and that the iraqi army is ready to take control completely away from the enemy
3885057 we celebrate the taking over of security because four years ago this area suffered from collapse and was called a ghost city
3885058 most families here lost family members but from support of the coalition we switched this area to become very secure
3885059 we call this area now an example of peace because the 1st battalion 25th brigade is going to be taking over
3885060 they will continue to stay strong and defeat the terrorists and anyone who tries to destroy iraq
3885061 friday aug 8 was our last day on the patrol base
3885062 this is one of the most prepared battalions in the 17th ia div they are ready to take over
3885063 remember sacrifice today as today is a day of celebration we celebrate the bravery and hard work of these men
3885064 you have fought to free the people of this area from fear and intimidation now the ia stands strong to protect from the corrupt and the criminal
3885065 hes outperformed for so many years but the credit crunch has him scrambling obviously he must still see some value in freddie because he keeps putting shareholder money in it
3885066 the question is will freddie mac be around in six months when they go to raise capital whos going to be there been trading like its going to 0 and the treasury hasnt detailed how they would structure any bailout so theres concern that theres not going to be anything left over in the plan for common shareholders
3885067 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3885068 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3885069 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
3885070 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
3885071 so these raven rote you called them where did they come from
3885072 we dont really know that except that when they did come they came in a most tremendous force by my reckoning theyve been here for oh id say fifty years now is that right laela
3885073 as far as any of us can tell yes fifty years is the most accurate guess
3885074 and the fact that we dont know their origin isnt entirely true counselor
3885075 it is no longer safe here the raven rote have come for what they have lost
3885076 theyre looking for me arent they then why dont i just give myself to them i cant possibly be worth the lives of everyone i just condemned
3885077 you apparently dont know these bastards very well even if they had you they would find some other reason to wipe us all out
3885078 now if you dont mind well be on our way
3885079 hmmm hard working guy probably talking to his wife or busy with a work call
3885080 xandros purchased linspire the company earlier this summer this week the company announced that it was going to revamp community distribution freespire basing its next version on debian instead of ubuntu and using it as a precursor for xandros desktop professional in much the same way red hat uses fedora and suse uses opensuse but the company didnt need multiple for pay desktop distributions so linspire is getting the boot

3885084 il nuoto non uno sport che piace a tutti o lo ami o lo odi faticoso terribile certe volte puoi allenarti insieme a dieci cento persone ma appena metti la testa sotto lacqua sei da solo in silenzio e se non hai della testa non ce la fai due ore in acqua tutti i giorni significano avere il tempo per pensare a tutti i casini che hai per la testa anche se non vuoi puoi entrare in acqua felice e uscirne arrabbiato come non lo sei mai stato oppure puoi entrarci dopo una giornata del cavolo e uscirne che te la sei quasi dimenticata ma chi che ha voglia di correre fuori da scuola per andare ad allenamento chi che ha voglia di rinunciare ad uscire con gli amici per tuffarsi nellacqua fredda chi che per una gara di due minuti se ne sta a casa il tanto atteso sabato sera chi che in estate ha voglia di alzarsi alle 8 per poter fare due allenamenti al giorno noi noi che sappiamo quanto bello tuffarsi e sentire le bollicine sulla pancia e lasciarsi scivolare fino a quando non si fermi per poi riaffiorare lentamente noi che sappiamo che non ci sono altri momenti in cui puoi pensare come quando sei in acqua solo noi che sappiamo come il silenzio di unapnea sia capace svuotare la testa e che non c niente di pi bello che fare la doccia in venti tutti insieme dopo lallenamento solo noi che sappiamo che non c nientaltro che ti fa sfogare cos e sappiamo che si pu essere felici anche per la gara di qualcunaltro quando la nostra andata male solo noi che dopo quella gara non vediamo lora che arrivi quella dopo per farla bene solo noi che abbiamo la testa ce la facciamo solo noi
3885085 in ogni gara la paura di fallire impedisce ad un sogno di volare
3885086 black basic time left one minute white basic time left one minute
3885087 we all made some mistakes at the crunching final minutes
3885088 it was a very hard game and they opponents played very well
3885089 it has been a very solid and eventful quarter for the company with progress on all fronts this marks our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential quarter to quarter top line growth during this period we have also improved our margins we have also successfully advanced our capital projects both for the ingot and wafer plant and the phase ii solar cell facility and we expect significant increases in our h2 of 2008 deliveries compared with h1 of 2008 further vertical integration on the ingot and wafer side is now well in progress with the company having produced its first wafers on august 2nd this will provide additional efficiencies in manufacturing the e module products and allow us to employ proprietary methods and patented technologies in the production of umg ingots and wafers during the quarter we have seen our average conversion efficiency for umg cells improve from approximately 13 3 to approximately 13 7 and we expect further improvements going forward on the supply side we have entered into two new long term contracts with ldk and new solar power which will improve our supply situation in 2009
3885090 in june we successfully completed the early conversion of our convertible notes due 2017 we successfully closed a secondary share offering in july with approximately 112 7 million of net proceeds as a result we believe that we now have one of the strongest balance sheets in the solar industry
3885091 revenues for q2 were 212 6 million which is more than 10 above our prior guidance of 185 190 million while our gross margin of 15 8 excluding silicon material sales remained above our target gross margin range of 13 15 our gaap income per diluted share included a one time non cash charge of 10 2 million associated with the early conversion of our convertible notes which will help csi save future interest payments our non gaap income per diluted share of 0 78 demonstrates our ability to continuously deliver strong operating results and returns to our shareholders our successful secondary offering in july has positioned us in a stronger foothold that would empower us to carry on in our path of rapid growth well into 2009 with elevated financial flexibility our cash position is now excellent as well as our financial ratios we have adequate resources for all of our planned h2 2008 capital expenditures and working capital purposes looking ahead we expect our margins to remain steady and within our target range i am confident that our quarterly revenue will continue to grow in the second half of 2008
3885092 a world wide positive intention experiment will be conducted at 8 pm universal time 08 08 08 to put an end to secret agreements that have prevented the revolutionary technology and knowledge of extraterrestrial life entering mainstream society a galactic freedom day declaration has been issued by cooperating citizen organizations clearly expressing humanitys intent to put an end to secret agreements concerning extraterrestrial life
3885093 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
3885094 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
3885095 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
3885096 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
3885097 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
3885098 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
3885099 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
3885100 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
3885101 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
3885102 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
3885103 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
3885104 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
3885105 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
3885106 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
3885107 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
3885108 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
3885109 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
3885110 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
3885111 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
3885112 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
3885113 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
3885114 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
3885115 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
3885116 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
3885117 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
3885118 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
3885119 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
3885120 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
3885121 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
3885122 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
3885123 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
3885124 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
3885125 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
3885126 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
3885127 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
3885128 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
3885129 those people are dreaming if they think they can get it done for that price
3885130 investing in the stock market is like driving in a car at night with no headlights and your steering went out you are driving blind and cant really predict where your profit will end up however real estate investing is more like reviewing the menu at your favorite restaurant you have plenty of options and can clearly see how your food will be prepared and delivered in other words you can see how and where your profit will be coming to you
3885131 you deserve a break today so get up and get away
3885132 plop plop fizz fizz oh what a relief it is
3885133 the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3885134 the app store was a big deal but thats one phone this is an entire carrier
3885135 despite the challenging economy and rising fuel costs its still a great time to find a deal on a luxury hotel
3885136 we are seeing luxury hotels slash prices up to 60 percent over the holiday weekend while adding perks such as complimentary cocktails and spa discounts to enhance travelers getaways
3885137 the second quarter of 2008 presented several challenges to the company and i am pleased to report that our management responded well to those challenges
3885138 i dont want to overlook the tremendous accomplishments that the organization achieved during the second quarter

3885147 wipe samples of portions of the artificial turf at baumholder and bulk samples from k town and grafenw hr playgrounds yielded low lead readings that exceeded the recommended environmental protection agency guidelines
3885148 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3885149 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions this is a very important statement for easing tension
3885150 german police have assumed jurisdiction in the investigation with the support of army criminal investigation command
3885151 some of our schools are under their projected enrollments and we re not sure if that s because people have moved or parents haven t registered yet
3885152 so we can ensure our resources are there for the first day of school
3885153 i cannot overemphasize the importance of registering or re registering students as soon as possible
3885154 the importance of doing so is that class assignments teacher hires and classroom supply allocations are based on student enrollment figures
3885155 60 of the u s can stop worrying about housing market
3885156 home builders post steep losses as value of unsold land slips

3885160 60 of the u s can stop worrying about the housing market
3885161 60 of the u s can stop worrying about housing market
3885162 is it a woman holding a baby or an insurgent holding an ak 47
3885163 it wasn t powerful enough loud enough and it didn t provide a lasting signature
3885164 that s ideally how the program should work this is something i need
3885165 we re supposed to be a liaison between commands and army research center and labs we talk to users on the ground if soldiers identify a problem we go back to the labs
3885166 a lot of our engineers wearing pocket protectors don t understand how a soldier operates
3885167 the buildings pop up it s like you re on a magic carpet
3885168 you get to see the geography points where you can be seen points where you can t be seen there s a wow factor
3885169 soldiers didn t have an opportunity to see it touch it train on it
3885170 we want to give our guys a technological edge so we can reach out and touch the bad guys before they touch us
3885171 soldiers said if you can figure out how to keep it in place it s great
3885172 why and how could this happen could this have been stopped
3885173 there is no doubt that the experiences he had on those deployments contributed to defining the man what sergeant james brought to us during his life was perfectly clear he was a hero
3885174 there was a spark about him that drew people to want to be his friend he truly cared about people and helping others
3885175 he used to say he had a gift for dancing it didn t matter what kind of song it was he would dance to it the dance always looked the same to me
3885176 i saw him go through two cars due to accidents he always had an explanation about how it wasn t his fault but we all knew the truth
3885177 when i got to ansbach i was nervous about going to my first duty station
3885178 sergeant james saw right through that he was caring he was always willing to do more than his fair share
3885179 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposure is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3885180 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3885181 any unplanned redeployment will have some near term impact on our operations as with any major change whether it s an addition or subtraction of force structure we ll make adjustments to ensure sustained operations
3885182 now the old king is dead long live the king
3885183 el mundo occidental se encuentra en una crisis econ mica de una magnitud similar a la del petr leo de 1973 asistimos nada menos que al desmoronamiento del liberalismo el modelo ideol gico y econ mico dominante en los ltimos 30 a os
3885184 del riesgo que supone el auge de los hedge funds y del capital riesgo
3885185 es una exageraci n que refleja el calor del momento
3885186 uno de los agujeros por los que ha llegado la crisis es que no se ha controlado bien el riesgo ha faltado juicio para tomar decisiones de inversi n por un problema de incentivos perversos quienes contrataban las hipotecas basura en ee uu eran agentes que trabajaban a comisi n no les importaba si luego el cliente pagaba o no y los bancos se quitaban del balance esos cr ditos al venderlos en paquetes financieros al final nadie se interesaba por si el cr dito era de buena o de mala calidad porque todo se vend a pero eso va a cambiar

3885246 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3885247 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3885248 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3885265 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3885266 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3885267 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3885268 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3885269 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3885270 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly

3885320 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy

3885333 this is truly an exciting venture as imaging professionals will not only have access to a single bundle of programs but multiple combinations
3885334 having spent several years trying to identify and serve the particular needs of the imaging industry we have become extremely familiar with the importance of specialized tools and were positive that customers of vertus and imagenomic will be very pleased with the pairings of these different programs they will have access to multiple powerful applications at a significant discount
3885335 photographers and art directors are relying on advanced imaging software tools to help provide a cleaner faster and more compelling photography deliverable for their clients and imagenomic is pleased to be a popular solution for many of these creative pros
3885336 we are excited to work with vertus to bundle our software suite with fluid mask 3 there are distinct advantages to using these tools together as such weve created a super suite that truly enhances the workflow for creative and visual pros

3885338 we are aware of the issues on the iphone 3g and were working with apple to provide a solution
3885339 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3885340 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows

3885344 many hard working american families who were able to make their mortgage payments under the initial teaser terms of the exotic loan are now struggling to make ends meet because their rates have doubled or tripled
3885345 fhasecure will bring stability to the housing market and give eligible families who were in good financial standing before their loans reset a chance to keep their homes
3885346 fhasecure is designed for families who are good borrowers but were steered into high cost loans with teaser rates
3885347 these homeowners many of whom are minorities need a safe affordable mortgage product that will help build wealth all fha borrowers pay mortgage insurance premiums to offset claims to the fha insurance fund and ultimately prevent risk to the taxpayer
3885348 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3885349 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3885350 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3885351 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3885352 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3885353 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3885354 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3885355 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3885356 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3885357 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3885358 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3885359 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3885360 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3885361 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3885366 we believe this reduction in cancellations is a positive indication for our industry as perhaps more buyers are willing and able to get to the finish line
3885367 it hasnt gotten any worse for the last three quarters so we feel as though weve stabilized but i dont want to give you the indication that that makes us feel good

3885378 why seek the best answer when a satisfactory one is at hand
3885379 c 14 is created when the reaction of cosmic rays with the ionosphere precipitates neutrons through the atmosphere these neutrons react with nitrogen 14 creating c 14 upon creation c 14 starts to decay and is today determined to have a half life of approximately 5 568 years organic material assimilates c 14 at a constant rate and knowing what the level of c 14 in an object was before it died scientist can measure the amount left and calculate its age since death apart from normal variations c 14 stays at a constant level in todays atmosphere
3885380 the original assumption on which c 14 dating was based is that its level in the atmosphere is the same at all times egyptologists and the carbon dating scientists were therefore in contradiction with each other the egyptologists and the archaeologists wouldnt budge and so the scientists were forced to reevaluate their findings what the scientists needed in order for c 14 dating to be accepted was a method of calibrating it
3885381 the answer came in the form of tree ring dating and the tree that was to accommodate this calibration was
3885382 the bristlecone pine enabled scientists to develop a chronology to calibrate carbon dating and adjust the clock unfortunately the development of this chronology actually incorporated c 14 of many bristlecone layers in other words they used c 14 to calibrate c 14
3885383 scientific integrity was ignored in favor of unanimity strangely scientists were calibrating c 14 to read older when in reality the readings should have been calibrated to read much younger this was later verified when accelerator mass spectrometry dating methods were invented then artifacts having c 14 dates of 28 000 years were giving ams readings of only 2 400 years and articles dating 70 000 c 14 years became only 4 100 years by ams dating
3885384 to make matters even worse for the establishment it is now being discovered that volcanoes can pour hundreds of cubic miles of c 14 into the atmosphere and this further dilutes the proportion of atmospheric c 14
3885385 knowing volcanism was profuse during the ice ages the vast accumulation of radiocarbon dates for the ice age has been compromised this dilution of c 14 causes the ice age to date more remote to our time than it really was another anomaly to factor in is the apparent decrease in atmospheric c 14 toward the poles therefore the closer one gets to either pole the older things will radiocarbon date
3885386 also there is the phenomenon that the closer in time to the ice age an artifact is tested the more exaggerated its antiquity this means that the accepted historical dates ascribed to ancient egypt are excessive according to radiocarbon tests but even these exaggerated radiocarbon dates are too old due to vulcanism therefore there is double jeopardy the further we retreat into antiquity toward the ice age the more exaggerated the c 14 test date

3885388 we really didnt get any data that made us feel any better about the financials
3885389 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3885390 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3885391 try getting into the frame of mind you were in when you lost it think to yourself where would i have put it
3885392 tell yourself you never cared much for it anyway then it will suddenly appear
3885393 when you organized everything the other day you put it away where it belongs
3885394 you are only imagining that you ever had it it was never here to begin with

3885412 the dual employ of hoffman as an official spokesman for salis congressional office and his campaign spokesman is unusual and inappropriate hoffman says he can keep his job separate by using different phones and stepping out of the congressmans office to deal with campaign related calls
3885413 official resources of the house must as a general rule be used for the performance of official business of the house and hence those resources may not be used for campaign or political purposes
3885414 the press secretary in the congressional office may answer occasional questions on political matters and may also respond to such questions that are merely incidental to an interview focused on the members official activity however while in the congressional office the press secretary should not give an interview that is substantially devoted to the campaign or initiate any call that is campaign related a press secretary wishing to do either of those things should do so outside of the congressional office and on his or her own time
3885415 once house employees have completed their official duties they are free to engage in campaign activities on their own time as volunteers or for pay as long as they do not do so in congressional offices or facilities or otherwise use official resources
3885416 what constitutes a staff members own time is determined by the personnel policies that are in place in the employing office time that is available to a staff member under those policies to engage in personal or other outside activities may instead be used to do campaign work if the individual so chooses the free time may include for example a lunch period time after the end of the business day and annual leave however a member may not adjust the work requirements of the congressional office or add unpaid interns during the campaign in order to create more free time for staff to do campaign work to help ensure compliance with the rules office policies on employee leave and other free time should be in writing and distributed to all employees
3885417 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3885418 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3885419 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3885420 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3885421 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3885422 it will be entirely consistent with labor party policy and the law

3885425 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3885426 until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result

3885432 its unforgivable that this governor would side with a corporation with dupont without understanding the intricacies
3885433 nobody from the governors office came to the trial one day nobody from the governors office came to see what happened nobody from the governors office reviewed any documents nobody from the governors office made a call to the people who were affected
3885434 nobody from the governors office read the transcripts the governors office simply became a puppet for dupont thats not uncommon for dupont thats how they operate
3885435 critical to the fair and rational imposition of punitive damages
3885436 has recognized that detailed appellate review of punitive awards serves as the foundation of the procedural rights afforded to litigants
3885437 parties commonly request such briefs from those that may have an interest in the issues presented by an appeal
3885438 like any person or organization dupont is entitled to raise issues of public concern with state officials the first amendment protects and encourages such communications the governor made his own independent judgment that the issues in this case are of public significance and filed his own brief
3885439 the plaintiffs should have the same right the defendant has
3885440 you can go and search forever and you wont find a governor that mixes public policy with judicial review if this type of argument is made it is typically made by the attorney generals office its like mixing apples and oranges
3885441 the governor neither opines on the underlying merits of the case nor argues for the reversal or modification of the jurys verdict
3885442 even had the governor not met with the president of dupont not met with the chief counsel of dupont and have people inside his own office related to dupont business filing the brief would have been suspect anyway
3885443 add all those factors in and the level of scrutiny should be increased
3885444 west virginia is virtually the only state that does not provide an automatic full appellate review of a punitive damages judgment
3885445 dupont is simply seeking a full and fair review of the trial court outcome which the company believes is infected by serious legal errors
3885446 the plaintiffs are trying to deny dupont its day in court if the plaintiffs were confident that their verdict was supported by the facts and the law they would not be so worried about the west virginia supreme court providing a full appeal
3885447 a west virginia jury exercising the sovereign power of the state has punished dupont severely
3885448 petitioner now seeks what due process requires a meaningful adequate and de novo review of its nine figure punishment such an exacting and fresh examination of the record even if affirmance is warranted should be provided

3885461 we the iranians are friends with all nations and most of the governments but recognize no territory as israel let alone recognizing israeli people

3885469 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger
3885470 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3885471 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3885472 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3885473 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3885474 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms
3885475 but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance

3885492 nous sommes profond ment attrist s par la mort de bill gwatney
3885493 in the mid 1980s it was such a small new movement it was a small sub group motley crue and poison was the big music speed metal was this side movement like punk once was metallica became an exception they eclipsed all the speed metal bands and then all the mainstream groups too all the other bands never became mainstream megadeth almost did slayer became the biggest underground group the rest of us were left in the parking lot now its a very different time there are younger bands that were influenced by the original wave of speed metal bands between those bands and the fact that a lot of the original bands are still going and putting out some of their best stuff the fans are into it and proud of it
3885494 that put us in arenas in the states and made us think this is pretty serious and probably will be for a long time
3885495 the more we read the more we thought it was a great idea
3885496 this was a man who did the best he possibly could for poor people and for the ill he was really trying to help people today we would have built hospitals and clinics then he would forewarn people of plagues and pestilence
3885497 i was 16 when i joined the band the big metal bands were dio scorpions and ozzy
3885498 all of a sudden the scene became hip to local bands metallica their shows were catching on and were just as exciting as the big arena shows exodus was a local band at that time it just seemed like what was happening in our area it was hard to see beyond the bay area at the time
3885499 it was fascinating to have gone in and out of studios big stages and seen the music business firsthand and then to be in this situation with all these up and coming musicians and i was an older student it felt like starting over which was exactly what i wanted whatever i am in my career or in life i try to find that space where i am supposed to be
3885500 i knew there was a possibility that things could pick up
3885501 i expressed that i needed time to do my other projects and it was a lot more appealing it was clear that everybody was older and easier to work with
3885502 i took a few weeks reviewing everything developing the technique
3885503 when we started doing it live the energy level was completely different i had to find my way on stage
3885504 we really tried to create the atmosphere to bring in some instruments that would have been around at the time
3885505 we split up and put pieces down and then came together and tried to piece it together sometimes one part of his life meant sadness and compassion other times it was blood and thunder and war the emotions are controlled by the events of what really happened we were being governed by the story and what we were trying to portray
3885506 i always thought from when i was a youngster that this music will only ever grow and grow
3885507 when you go to see a band theres nothing really that can replace that nothing can stop it really its like a machine
3885508 i think it is a good idea if such an opportunity comes my way to go and play in pakistan
3885509 you dont have tournaments there otherwise i would have loves to come and play in pakistan
3885510 i remember that my first ever tournament outside india was in pakistan its great place and i will definitely go there in future when the opportunity comes
3885511 this study should be enlightening and practice changing for doctors and patients alike
3885512 its a tricky business and it requires a lot of close followup
3885513 whats happening in beijing is not an indication of a new kinder gentler chinese government a kinder gentler authoritarian regime
3885514 its a carefully scripted and controlled image they want to project to the world
3885515 the chinese people are great but shame on the chinese government because they are lying to the people of china
3885516 tibetans are going through psychological torture physical torture to the extent that people are committing suicide
3885517 those foreign protesters appear to have been handled with a relative level of restraint by security forces
3885518 in the eyes of the chinese government the priority isnt to punish those individuals they want them removed from the scene and off their hands theyre an embarrassment
3885519 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
3885520 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3885521 the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3885522 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3885523 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
3885524 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3885525 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3885526 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
3885527 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
3885528 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
3885529 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3885530 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3885531 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law
3885532 they all left the building as quick as they could
3885533 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas
3885534 were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3885535 pinning huckabee down on an issue is like nailing jello to the wall
3885536 the senseless shooting at democratic party headquarters in little rock today is a shocking and sobering reminder of just how depraved our world has become all of our thoughts and prayers turn toward bill gwatney and his family today while we await details on what happened and why
3885537 arkansas democratic party chairman dead after shooting inside party headquarters
3885538 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
3885539 i have proposed an increase of osce monitors by 100
3885540 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else
3885541 i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
3885542 as an opportunity to consult with our counterparts about the implications of the russian action in georgia
3885543 we have a feeling of disappointment yes because we feel that actions of this type have to be openly condemned but at the same time i do understand europe tries to be a mediator perhaps putting the blame might be difficult
3885544 the gravest breach of the commitments of the council of europe
3885545 the international community will want to ensure that the message goes out that force is not the right way to take forward these difficult issues
3885546 i see no point in us getting lost in a long debate today about responsibility for and origins of the escalation of the last few days
3885547 you have x spies in this city so you can do y
3885548 really tone down the micromanagement that was present in previous versions because that is definitely the way that modern real time strategy games are progressing
3885549 the big issue for us is capacity what were doing far exceeds normal usage
3885550 there are a lot of people pulling wires everywhere right now
3885551 we have a lot of people working in odd places
3885552 we try to make use of every square foot of the building
3885553 i just assume were going to have to run stuff to every nook and cranny
3885554 were working on building an incredible tournament that will be here for a long time and one that has a lot of excitement around it and that the players all want to come to and being here at sedgefield on this fantastic donald ross course gives us the ability to make the wyndham championship one of those premiere events on the pga tour
3885555 we are currently studying the legal details of the case for extradition
3885556 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3885557 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
3885558 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
3885559 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
3885560 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
3885561 during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most its disappointing that the obama campaign has chosen to launch inflammatory and baseless political attacks
3885562 it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after launching attack after attack on barack obama for his strong and appropriate response to the conflict in georgia but its characteristic of the old washington tactics that have failed the american people
3885563 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
3885564 but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3885565 when this crisis began barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3885566 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement and he may or may not have complicated the situation
3885567 and thats in part because we have been focused on iraq and our foreign policy has now become monolithic
3885568 its about your attitude your demeanor the decisions you make as a teacher how you decide to create relationships with kids all of those things you can control
3885569 what we really need is weve got to partner with parents that its an expectation at the home front that theyre going to behave at school
3885570 no one has a bigger embedded user base than office
3885571 what we see happening is companies like webex connect salesforce com microsoft and google are trying to fence in their little area of the cloud
3885572 you sign into salesforce com in the morning and stay there all day
3885573 you can view and edit your documents in expresso but be inside any of those platforms
3885574 right from the beginning i have always believed and also expressed the peoples republic of china the most populated nation very important so the international community should not isolate china must bring it into the mainstream of the world community
3885575 and certain principles such as democracy human rights religious freedom rule of law in these principle matters you should be firm
3885576 the secretary general appeals for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population
3885577 seven villages have been cleared and well clear eight more today
3885578 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3885579 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3885580 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3885581 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3885582 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3885583 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3885584 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3885585 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3885586 sharon osbourne ozzys wife spent his money the chanel store on robertson

3885593 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3885594 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3885595 the dual employ of hoffman as an official spokesman for salis congressional office and his campaign spokesman is unusual and inappropriate hoffman says he can keep his job separate by using different phones and stepping out of the congressmans office to deal with campaign related calls
3885596 official resources of the house must as a general rule be used for the performance of official business of the house and hence those resources may not be used for campaign or political purposes
3885597 the press secretary in the congressional office may answer occasional questions on political matters and may also respond to such questions that are merely incidental to an interview focused on the members official activity however while in the congressional office the press secretary should not give an interview that is substantially devoted to the campaign or initiate any call that is campaign related a press secretary wishing to do either of those things should do so outside of the congressional office and on his or her own time
3885598 once house employees have completed their official duties they are free to engage in campaign activities on their own time as volunteers or for pay as long as they do not do so in congressional offices or facilities or otherwise use official resources
3885599 what constitutes a staff members own time is determined by the personnel policies that are in place in the employing office time that is available to a staff member under those policies to engage in personal or other outside activities may instead be used to do campaign work if the individual so chooses the free time may include for example a lunch period time after the end of the business day and annual leave however a member may not adjust the work requirements of the congressional office or add unpaid interns during the campaign in order to create more free time for staff to do campaign work to help ensure compliance with the rules office policies on employee leave and other free time should be in writing and distributed to all employees

3885602 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3885603 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3885604 why is this happening not because of a political decision or some change in agenda of the democratic party but instead because of a power clash a personality clash
3885605 were not here to show were the most savvy when it comes to legislative maneuvers were not here to say my way is the best way and everyone who disagrees is wrongheaded or evil
3885606 its not enough in my judgment to say you want health care you want jobs you want education you want to protect working class and middle class families but then you take no for an answer
3885607 at some point you gotta do more than just the talk you gotta do the walk you gotta get it done
3885608 theyre lucky to have a job and health care theyre going to keep
3885609 it takes courage to say something like that in front of a bunch of party regulars but i think that comptroller hynes spoke what we all know

3885647 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3885648 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3885649 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
3885650 the car was clearly marked they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in humanitarian community in afghanistan
3885651 since they oppose the current government they also oppose those who work with it
3885652 and unfortunately they dont differentiate among armed multinational forces security contractors and humanitarian groups
3885653 the irc provides lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted

3885665 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3885666 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3885667 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3885672 the key thing here is this is the first time people have had competition
3885673 thank you so much for the awesomely complete coverage you are providing on all of the equestrian activities at the 2008 olympic games we horse people are fanatics just like many other sports followers and have felt a little left out in years past but we understand that most americans dont care about equestrian and that it air time is precious and that it doesnt make good business sense to spend much air time on a mostly unknown or little understood sport

3885687 from a financial performance perspective we experienced a difficult quarter due to tough market conditions and a non recurring charge
3885688 that said relative to our peers and the overall banking market we continue to stand on solid ground with respect to our capitalization liquidity asset quality and core banking operations we are successfully weathering the current storm in the housing market and economy and we expect to come out the other side in good condition
3885689 we have always been very conservative in our lending standards
3885690 we have never originated or purchased any subprime loans alt a loans or option arm loans nor do we hold any investment securities that are collateralized by these types of loans as a result our loan portfolio has continued to perform relatively well even in a difficult market in addition we have been successful in reducing our exposure to residential and commercial construction loans in 2008 while increasing the balance of residential real estate mortgages our goal is to continue to improve our overall portfolio credit quality and recent experience has shown that residential real estate mortgages tend to perform better than construction loans in this market
3885691 as we look to the future our focus remains on growing our franchise along the coasts of florida georgia and south carolina
3885692 to that end we will continue to actively seek out opportunities either by merger and acquisition or de novo branching where it makes sense we also plan to take full advantage of the recent merger of our banking subsidiaries which already has resulted in economies of scale and increased efficiency in our operations to continue to reduce costs and improve the operational efficiency of our company
3885693 i believe means i trust no more must i dream of trusting in myself i no longer require to justify myself to excuse myself to attempt to save and preserve myself this most profound effort of man to trust to himself to see himself as in the right has become pointless i believe not in myself i believe in god the father the son and the holy ghost so also trust in any sort of authorities who might offer themselves to me as trustworhty as an anchor which i ought to hold on to has become frail and superflous trust in any sort of gods has become frail and superfluous these are the gods set up honoured and worshipped by men in ancient and recent times the authorities on whom man relies no matter whether they have the form of ideas or of any sort of powers of destiny no matter what they are called faith delivers us from trust in such gods and therefore also from fear of them from the disillusionments which they inevitably prepare for us again and again we are given freedom to trust in him who deserves our trust freedom by holding to him who in distinction from all other authorities is and will remain faithful we oursleves shall never be true to ourselves our human path is as such a path from one disloyalty to another and it is the same with the ways of the gods of this world they do not keep what they promise so with them there is never any real peace and clarity in god alone is there faithfulness and faith is the trust that we hold to him to his promise and to his guidance to hold to god is to rely on the fact that god is there for me and to live in this certainty
3885694 for christian faith is faith in god and when the christian confession names god the father the son and the holy spirit it is pointing to the fact that in his inner life and nature god is not dead not passive not inactive but that god the father son and holy spirit exist in an inner relationship and movement which may very well be described as a story as an event
3885695 the whole work of god lives and moves in this one person he who says god in the sense of holy scripture will necessarily have to say jesus christ over and over again
3885696 i would not say that god is freedom or that god is love even though the second pronouncement is a biblical one we do not know what love is and we do not know what freedom is but god is love and god is freedom what freedom is and what love is we have to learn from him as predicate to this subject it may be said that he is the god of free love in his work of creation covenant and redemption he proves himself to be this god it is there that we experience what love is this desire of the other for his own sake so that the one is no longer alone but completely together with the other this is love this is gods free love god is not lonely not even without the world he does not need the other and nevertheless he loves this love cannot be understood apart from the majesty of his freedom it is gods love that he the father loves the son who himself is god what in his work becomes visible is an uncovering of this mystery of his inner being where all is freedom and all is love
3885697 the man who is ashamed of israel is ashamed of jesus christ and therefore of his own existence
3885698 gods faithfulness in the reality of israel is in fact the guarantee of his faithfulness to us too and to all men
3885699 she was the first and only woman indeed the first and only american to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public
3885700 it is a tragedy i feel that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life

3885712 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3885713 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3885714 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3885715 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3885716 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3885717 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper

3885814 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
3885815 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them
3885816 14 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid 15 neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
3885817 and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light
3885818 26 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them
3885819 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul
3885820 21 and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good 24 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so 25 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good
3885821 8 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god 9 not of works lest any man should boast

3885826 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls
3885827 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
3885828 26 for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment 28 so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation
3885829 20 and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the mother of all living 21 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them

3885855 whats the best way for me to turn you on to something i think youll love
3885856 uh really what if its already on itunes shouldnt i just send you the link
3885857 yeah i commute an hour each way to apples office i do all my real listening in the car so i need the cd
3885858 for a long time i wasnt in bands with people who liked the same music that i do and now i am for the fucking first time
3885859 ill start with a musical theme and ill keep going with it thats why our songs are kind of long
3885860 i keep fleshing out the theme and ill come up with a minimal melody and keep bringing it back even though the part of the song and time signature has changed
3885861 a lot of people try to be gods gift to mankind and try to make shit unique i think its more about showing your roots or at least the process
3885862 about sound not about playing an instrument in its traditional sense or being musically adept
3885863 the amp and pedals are just as much an instrument
3885864 they put out so many records that are all different they show both sides of the coin per se and thats important its the way they use drone with rock songs though theyre not the first to do it theyve become archetype for me
3885865 they did it a long time ago and nobody gave a fuck and now everybodys all over harvey milk courtesy and good will toward men changed my view on music i had never heard anything like it they re contextualized heavy music for me
3885866 i wanted to make a recording subjective where it wasnt about instruments i wanted to be just as much about the room as the instruments

3885886 todav a seguimos vivos es un torneo muy complicado pero la vamos a pelear
3885887 sumando once puntos estamos clasificados tenemos que ganar todos los partidos que nos quedan para poder lograrlo y yo creo que este grupo est capacitado y lo puede hacer
3885888 el partido estaba controlado lo ten amos para cerrar marcando el tercer gol pero no estuvimos lo suficientemente tranquilos como para poder rematarlo
3885889 tenemos que definir las situaciones que generamos y creo que ah est la clave le dimos la posibilidad de agrandarse a gran breta a
3885890 creo que estamos manejando muy bien la bocha a los rivales les cuesta mucho cortar nuestro juego pero fallamos en la definici n y en eso estamos obligados a mejorar
3885891 no tengo ning n tipo de dudas de que jap n ser un equipo duro ellos son un conjunto que juega muy r pido no hay que darles ritmo porque sino te pueden liquidar

3885901 so what do you gals have planned for us is it weird sexual things if so im game and im sure lulu will keep an open mind
3885902 i always knew something like this would happen because youre a stuck up bitch and thats why i kept telling the others we needed to one day just drive you out into the middle of the woods and leave you there doug was against it though because hes stupid
3885903 weve been playing a kids game for a very long time
3885904 i have to say you are some ugly looking women
3885905 since we technically work for dammon too were all on the same side no reason for us to be cuffed then
3885906 yes get my cuffs off so i can give everyone a hug
3885907 will you explain to me why we dont just toss these idiots out the door as soon as we reach altitude
3885908 so do you have any idea what theyre keeping you alive for
3885909 who said were lesbians just because a group of women get together for violent purposes doesnt mean theyre lesbians if a group of men get together for military purposes do you assume theyre homosexuals
3885910 i hear every time you try to divide by zero on a pocket calculator you break apart a piece of reality
3885911 you know ive never actually heard of anyone actually being killed in the wastelands

3885917 controlul asupra retelei de conducte care leaga fostele republici sovietice de occident i a permis rusiei sa preia o mare parte profiturile pe care aceste tari le obtineau din vanzarea de petrol si gaze dar odata cu aparitia btc sustinuta activ de guvernele eurpene si sua rusia urma sa si piarda controlul monopolist deschizand calea companiilor occidentale de a face investitii de miliarde de dolari in statele caucaziene bogate in resurse energetice
3885918 cu timpul majoritatea eforturilor lor s au concentrat pe un proiect in valoare de 12 miliarde de dolari cunoscut sub numele de nabucco care ar fi transportat gazul caspic via georgia turcia bulgaria romania si ungaria ajungand la un terminal energetic in apropiere de viena europa este deja dependenta energetic de rusia importand din aceasta tara o patrime din gazele naturale consumate dependenta ce ar urma sa creasca in viitor prin construirea unei conducte directe prin marea baltica ce va lega germania de rusia
3885919 putin in mod corect a privit nabucco ca facand parte dintr o campanie mai ampla condusa de washington de a izola rusia si de a limita expansiunea imperiului sau energetic
3885920 ni s a amintit din nou ca vladimir putin nu are nici o retinere in a sacrifica statul de drept si parerea buna a celorlati pentru a proteja imperiul rus si monopolul sau energetic tehnicile folosite pentru a ingenunchea georgia chiar daca mult mai letale si distructive sunt aceleasi cu cele utilizate de putin pentru a reduce la tacere opozitia si pentru a expropria companiile energetice yukos shell si bp
3885921 any time a heavy kills an enemy with the k g b he receives five seconds of guaranteed critical hits this crit boost can be used to punch and kill further enemies extending the boost time alternatively the heavy can switch to another weapon and use the boost to take out an enemy at range the heavys slow movement speed and the k g bs slower swing speed make it a risky prospect

3885937 still trying to decide whether i need one or not
3885938 if indeed russia is violating a ceasefire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
3885939 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system

3885955 obviously a huge number of biological entities from molecule sized to cell sized regularly traverse the body and perform a wide variety of essential functions so we know such a thing is possible in principle
3885956 of course all of these challenges were taken into account in the first serious study of the feasibility of nanoscale robotic systems titled nanosystems well need to build nanomachines using nanomechanical principles not naive reapplications of macroscale engineering principles
3885957 molecular manufacturing applies the principles of mechanical engineering to chemistry
3885958 if the machines used to maintain high vacuum and extreme refrigeration could be manufactured for the cost of raw materials and energy can be obtained in great abundance from nano manufactured durable self cleaning solar panels i am skeptical that this would be as substantial of a barrier as it is to similar high requirement processes today

3885994 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play

3886002 oh you write poetry ive always wanted to write poetry
3886003 but then what does it mean to empty your head of your own words of your own wishing of your own self can this be the place of prayer to stand in where the self once stood seeking itself in itself to shut out the noise of the self who persists in bumping around in its own dark parts i am in my own way realizing it has opened up a path towards what feels like a very fragile but approachable silence i recognize in reality that it is my path that is fragile not this silence and that it is this silence who is approaching me and not the other way around and that i can do nothing really to achieve closure all i can do is get out of the way its as if the stones in the path were long ago laid down very crookedly so that the way became impassable and as though im having to agree to his tearing up the masonry one stone at a time so that he might arrive to reset each stone with love in his own good time tearing up the masonry is noisy work and i dont much like how it feels it has set a lot of things afloat in the interim things i do trust will eventually heal though it is meanwhile now and then pretty uncomfortable like re breaking and resetting bones my sudden overwhelming fear of other people for instance just as though something weak the work of a toddler had finally snapped and all this trouble with with writing too like trying to hear a whisper at a construction site full of jackhammers in the midst of other old worries rearing their thorny heads up again it is easy to mistake yourself for god to tell yourself a spiritual life is good for me beneficial like exercise but none of that later explains a longing for a life far beyond the concerns of your own well being i dont have words for this im borrowing words as you can see

3886025 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
3886026 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3886027 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3886028 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3886029 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3886030 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
3886031 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3886032 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
3886033 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
3886034 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3886035 i debated this fellow many times throughout the state in 2006 and it was like pulling teeth to get him to commit to a position or a plan
3886036 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3886037 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3886038 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3886039 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3886040 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3886041 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3886042 i actually wrote a song for my new album called my baby its a real beautiful song
3886043 so that in the future labor day crapper be famous as a day when workers freed themselves from the state and moved to a privately managed estimation system
3886044 were going to eventually make a 24 movie one day if fans are still interested by then
3886045 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
3886046 so we all agreed to preserve the series just to focus on that and then when the series is done we would embark on the film
3886047 its the early stages of dating she is a little boy crazy over him
3886048 giocando con gente come ibrahimovic adriano cruz e crespo che sono pi adatti a fare le punte centrali io mi trovo meglio a fare lesterno comunque ha aggiunto ovunque lallenatore mi metta a giocare per me va bene sullesterno avevo gi giocato qualche volta anche nella passata stagione devo migliorare in qualche movimento per mi adatto senza problemi
3886049 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3886050 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3886051 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3886052 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3886053 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3886054 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3886055 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3886056 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3886057 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3886058 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3886059 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3886060 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3886061 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3886062 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3886063 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3886064 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3886065 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3886066 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3886067 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3886068 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3886069 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3886070 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3886071 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3886072 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3886073 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3886074 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3886075 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3886076 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3886077 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3886078 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3886079 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3886080 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3886081 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3886082 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3886083 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3886084 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3886085 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3886086 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3886087 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3886088 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3886089 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3886090 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3886091 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3886092 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3886093 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3886094 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3886095 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3886096 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3886097 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3886098 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3886099 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3886100 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3886101 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3886102 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3886103 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
3886104 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
3886105 these are all small things and they all add up
3886106 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3886107 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
3886108 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
3886109 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
3886110 i see him all the time at least once a week we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
3886111 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3886112 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
3886113 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
3886114 it happened very casually he came by the house and i went off with him in his car and had sex
3886115 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
3886116 he casey thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
3886117 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up have sex i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
3886118 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally
3886119 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art
3886120 i want the best for him aldridge i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to
3886121 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3886122 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3886123 obama was the editor of his class harvard law review bushs daddy bought his way into yale where he graduated in history
3886124 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3886125 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3886126 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3886127 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3886128 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3886129 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3886130 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3886131 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3886132 ah shit now i have to go down and meet him
3886133 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3886134 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3886135 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3886136 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3886137 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3886138 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3886139 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3886140 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3886141 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3886142 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3886143 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3886144 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3886145 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3886146 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3886147 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3886148 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3886149 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3886150 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3886151 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3886152 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3886153 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3886154 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3886155 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3886156 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3886157 come on addie how long have we been friends you know you can tell me anything i wont judge you now whats going on
3886158 it happened when navy was 15 years old bobbie was at the movies with a couple of girlfriends
3886159 yes she was 12 and halfway through the movie she had to go to the bathroom navy saw her in the hallway and followed her into the restroom he threatened to hurt her if she screamed but when he pulled down his pants and grabbed her she screamed anyway he got out of there before anybody else saw him
3886160 thats awful why didnt you ever tell me about this addie
3886161 bobbie didnt want anybody to know she was embarrassed and she was afraid to tell her momma because she had been told to stay with the other girls at all times but they didnt want to miss any of the movie and she couldnt wait
3886162 we explained to her that we needed to tell the police about it so navy couldnt do it to any other girls they took her statement but nothing ever came of it i always wondered if ellegora paid somebody to make the whole thing go away
3886163 ellegora thinks i did i had motive or least i used to at the time he did that to bobbie i wanted to kill him i dont know whether i really could have i hated him
3886164 not completely i could hardly stand to be in the same room with him but i wouldnt have killed him
3886165 okay so you had motive and opportunity you could have put fish oil in that coffee cake but what about the epi pen what did the chief say about that
3886166 he didnt have anything to say about it as soon as i brought it up he told me he was done
3886167 yes for example manny monet ive been told that he does loan sharking on the side
3886168 and i was thinking that if navy had borrowed money from him and couldnt pay it back
3886169 manny would kill him i dont know its a possibility
3886170 and cash crawley oh i havent had a chance to tell you cash is the one who has the fake recipe book he must have hired navy to steal it
3886171 yeah i was shocked but he says navy gave it to him and that he had nothing to do with navys death
3886172 but i believe him i cant really see a motive but im wondering about his brother bull because from what i understand bull and cash hate each other
3886173 so suppose bull somehow found out that navy was stealing the recipe book for cash he might have figured that once the police discovered that cash hired navy to steal the book they might think cash killed him to cover up the theft if anybody ever learned that his new cupcake recipes were really mine his business would be ruined
3886174 boy youve really put a lot of thought into this havent you
3886175 im just trying to keep lacey or you or some other innocent person from going to prison
3886176 when are you going to share your ideas with the police
3886177 you know ginger i was thinking if the coffee cake wasnt poisoned until after navy left here with it how did the killer get the fish oil into it you couldnt just pour it on top do you suppose they used a hypodermic needle
3886178 you dont think the killer would have been stupid enough
3886179 to buy it at coreyville pharmacy who knows sometimes criminals do really dumb things
3886180 yes oh you came by this afternoon looking for him didnt you
3886181 he can be hard to catch sometimes hes in and out all day
3886182 i know im sorry i drove by your house but you werent home then i spotted you over here what were you doing
3886183 oops i must have left my phone at the house
3886184 oh no poor lacey do you know if cheryl called her
3886185 yes she did so i thought you might want to go check on her
3886186 some guy found his body out at that illegal dump south of town at first he just saw his car then he grabbed a flashlight to look around danny was lying face down in the dirt
3886187 theyre not sure probably last night the guy found his body less than an hour ago
3886188 no youre not dont say that what happened to them was not your fault
3886189 ive got to figure out who this killer is before he kills somebody else
3886190 but not tonight worry about it tomorrow you need rest
3886191 the cheapest car to run is the car you already own
3886192 id like to explain how a dashingly youthful 59 year old came to be driving a geezermobile in the first place
3886193 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3886194 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3886195 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3886196 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3886197 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3886198 just so you all know we did set a record
3886199 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3886200 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3886201 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3886202 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3886203 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3886204 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3886205 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3886206 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3886207 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3886208 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3886209 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3886210 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3886211 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3886212 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3886213 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3886214 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3886215 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3886216 for the nations interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3886217 people feel like they eat a great meal and later on you tell them there was a fly in it
3886218 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3886219 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3886220 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3886221 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3886222 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3886223 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3886224 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3886225 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3886226 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3886227 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3886228 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3886229 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3886230 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3886231 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3886232 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3886233 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3886234 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3886235 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3886236 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3886237 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3886238 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3886239 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3886240 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3886241 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3886242 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3886243 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3886244 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3886245 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3886246 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3886247 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3886248 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3886249 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3886250 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3886251 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3886252 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3886253 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3886254 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3886255 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3886256 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3886257 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3886258 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3886259 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3886260 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3886261 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3886262 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3886263 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3886264 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3886265 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3886266 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3886267 i commend our new attorney general and her staff for the courage fortitude and heart theyve shown in their recent efforts shutting down illegal gambling machines on guam
3886268 until we are absolutely sure that these amusement devices are illegal gaming devices under guam law i have advised my client to refrain from revoking the licenses because the ramifications of denying the applicati
3886269 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3886270 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3886271 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3886272 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3886273 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3886274 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3886275 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3886276 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3886277 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3886278 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3886279 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3886280 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3886281 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3886282 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3886283 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3886284 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3886285 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3886286 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3886287 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3886288 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3886289 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3886290 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3886291 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3886292 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3886293 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3886294 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3886295 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3886296 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3886297 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3886298 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3886299 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3886300 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3886301 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3886302 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3886303 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3886304 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3886305 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3886306 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3886307 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3886308 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3886309 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3886310 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3886311 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3886312 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3886313 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3886314 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3886315 if at first you dont succeed youre not chuck norris
3886316 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3886317 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3886318 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet

3886321 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3886322 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

3886327 after tet there was a massive shift from combat avoidance to mutiny
3886328 mutiny became so common that the army was forced to disguise its frequency by talking instead of combat refusal
3886329 resembled a strike and occurred when gis refused disobeyed or negotiated an order into combat
3886330 unlike mutinous outbreaks of the past which were usually sporadic short lived events the progressive unwillingness of american soldiers to fight to the point of open disobedience took place over a four year period between 1968 71
3886331 it was an organized strike a shaken brass relieved the company commander but they did not charge the guys with anything the brass surrendered to the strength of the organized men
3886332 we have no business there we just sat down then they promised us we wouldnt have to go to cambodia

3886338 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3886339 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate
3886340 im been on three dates with her and shes making me wait for sex which means im horny

3886358 this drug has great potential to treat not only alcoholism but other stress related disorders as well
3886359 its like you put the key in a lock but dont turn it
3886360 then you break the key off so no one can use it
3886361 the euphoria you experience with alcohol is extremely rapid and mostly happens within the first 15 to 30 minutes after your first drink
3886362 without that initial euphoric reaction you are less likely to have that second third or fourth drink
3886363 crf antagonists like cp 154 526 could help re establish homeostasis involved with hedonic disregulation

3886379 its possible we dont know thats the detective work weve got to undertake
3886380 its a little bit too early for us to tell because they have 60 days to come up with a cleanup plan and as far as were concerned were going to go business as usual
3886381 were going to trust the health department to come in and i know theyre going to keep monitoring the whole situation
3886382 im concerned that when contamination is found the state seems to respond and cotter that those wells arent used but if they werent contaminated someone might use them that isnt a reason to feel ok about this
3886383 they said they could 25 years ago and everyone agreed they could and now look where we are

3886404 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3886405 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3886406 ive heard he said something do to about losing a job he didnt threaten anyone
3886407 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded
3886408 bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3886409 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us
3886410 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery

3886418 the document is presumed open to the public unless sealed by court order
3886419 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3886420 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
3886421 once we get that commitment we can set our course with our contractor to get started providing we get the funds also deposited into our accounts

3886425 certainly the death penalty could be sought in every capital case tried but that would clearly be a decision made without regard to thought of anything other than emotions
3886426 it makes no sense but points out even more so why we must look at case law in our evaluation process
3886427 all of the sudden he comes from around the corner two to three feet away and said you need to watch your mouth
3886428 he was dressed like a firefighter and i wasnt about to let somebody i didnt know make me go outside with him
3886429 he tried to talk to her but he didnt have a choice
3886430 there were people standing around kids and parents wondering if he was going to do anything about this
3886431 if she would have said yes sir there would have been no problem and she would have been able to walk off but there was not really much else he could do he has to uphold the law
3886432 i probably wouldnt have acted that way if i knew what was going on
3886433 it happened so fast i didnt know how to react he was being a real smart ass himself
3886434 i told him only when people are treating me wrongly
3886435 i get tired of cops always having an attitude right off the bat
3886436 its not like i robbed anybody to have that attitude with me when all i did was cuss
3886437 you just cant go off swearing and hollering you just cant do it

3886452 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3886453 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3886454 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

3886458 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3886459 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3886460 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3886461 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

3886499 to take a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
3886500 det h r med resurser till skolan k nns som bullshit
3886501 about two years ago a letter arrived from a solemn young vassar lady telling me how much she enjoyed reading my experiment in space mythology but she added wouldnt it be a good idea this late in time to rewrite the book inserting more womens characters and roles
3886502 shut the door theyre coming through the window shut the window theyre coming through the door
3886503 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3886504 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3886505 it is really a cooling off not this big dramatic breakup
3886506 whos to say where it will end up but now he has a lot going on
3886507 if she said she wants kids and hes not ready thats not being needy its being honest
3886508 in a walk through old growth forest there are thousands if not millions of chemicals and their synergistic effects with one another what trees do chemically in the environment is something were only beginning to understand
3886509 what she terms a bioplan reforesting cities and rural areas with trees according to the medicinal environmental nutritional pesticidal and herbicidal properties she claims for them which she calls ecofunctions
3886510 so what could be in the forest air that makes us feel better
3886511 in a study done in the sierra nevadas of california researchers found 120 different chemical compounds but they could only identify seventy of them we are literally breathing things we dont understand which also means of course that when we lose these forests we dont know what we are losing
3886512 i also tried huffy and had the same issues but with an even more enormous file size
3886513 missional life and leadership remain docile concepts until someone is moved to action
3886514 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3886515 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3886516 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3886517 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3886518 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3886519 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3886520 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3886521 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3886522 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3886523 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3886524 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3886525 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3886530 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3886531 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3886532 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3886533 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3886534 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3886535 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3886536 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3886537 we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3886538 well stranger what were they like where you lived before
3886539 those folks were the meanest angriest lying cheating folks youd ever want to meet why do you think i packed up and left

3886542 youll love it here the people are just the same as where you lived before
3886543 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3886544 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3886545 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3886546 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3886547 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3886548 colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this

3886554 we would comply with the law if we could right now we do not have resources to produce original programs in the kyrgyz language or translate uzbek programs to kyrgyz
3886555 nowadays even big tv companies cannot afford that we cannot survive under such legislation without help from the government

3886558 a convoy of russian tanks left gori but is not heading to tbilisi
3886559 id like to calm everybody down the russian military is not advancing towards the capital
3886560 unfortunately we are forced to restate the very fact that the principal agreement reached on the ceasefire and the return of the armed formations to the places of their permanent dislocation is being permanently violated by the russian federation
3886561 despite the assurances from the georgian side that they have ended all military activities russian troops shot down a second georgian drone over tskhinvali earlier today
3886562 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3886563 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here
3886564 truce was signed to withdraw russian troops and withdraw georgian troops what about the ossetian and abkazian separatists
3886565 we have always said if the wto director general pascal lamy feels there is a chance for another opening we will be prepared to come again to geneva
3886566 come to the table not looking for what you can get but what you can give
3886567 still a possibility to move this forward and conclude the negotiations within the timeframe that is end 2008
3886568 the july retail sales report was much as expected plunging vehicle sales dragged down the headline figure and the rise in ex autos spending will have been eaten up by higher food and petrol prices
3886569 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season underway that does not bode well for retailers
3886570 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten and the surge of stimulus payments is now over
3886571 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3886572 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3886573 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3886574 rat meat will make up nutrition deficiencies among villagers since rats are a major source of protein
3886575 you have a lot of companies out there manufacturing these boxes and theres nothing necessarily proprietary about them they only cost about 30 or 40 at most and theyre charging around 15 a month for them

3886585 colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this
3886586 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
3886587 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3886588 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement

3886684 one of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
3886685 as newshour viewers know we strive mightily to make sure each side gets roughly equal time in conducting debates like this the attempt was not successful in this case though not for lack of trying a look at the
3886686 i wont comment on the quality of boots answers as many viewers did

3886689 steinbergs teeth were yellowed his nose and chin made more bulbous and his ears jugged
3886690 in a technique familiar to students of vintage german propaganda his ears were pulled out his teeth splayed apart his forehead lowered and his nose was widened and enlarged in a way that made him look more like fagin than the guy i work with
3886691 poking a little fun at steinberg for misreporting the situation as he does all the time and they used an unflattering caricature of him
3886692 i understand that you plan to air on november 18th a program that says the old testament is a bunch of made up stories that never happened it the bibles buried secrets even says the bible is not true
3886693 i have also been informed that the producer paula apsell said
3886694 congress gives pbs hundreds of millions of tax dollars to help support the network over the years i have highly recommended your station to my students in the public school where i teach no longer will i do this i now i believe that the bibles buried secrets is a perfect reason congress should stop supporting pbs with our tax dollars
3886695 a petition urging congress to stop using tax dollars to fund pbs
3886696 consider making a small tax deductible contribution to help us continue
3886697 the public broadcasting system pbs probably the most liberal network in america will present a program this fall that says the old testament is a bunch of made up stories that never happened the bibles buried secrets says the bible is not true it is scheduled to air on november 18
3886698 i have often said that pbs should not receive tax dollars the bibles buried secrets is simply one more reason congress should stop supporting pbs with our tax dollars congress gives pbs hundreds of millions of tax dollars to help support the network
3886699 the comments came from a response to a press conference question by dr william dever a biblical scholar who participated in the film
3886700 the bibles buried secrets is a comprehensive archeological and literary investigation that traces the origins of the ancient israelites explores the evolution of their belief in one god and reveals how the manifestation of their faith the hebrew bible also known as the old testament was written
3886701 is indisputably adorable but it lacks the magic of the magliozzis unplugged
3886702 this is not our show and besides it is an opinion program
3886703 television talk show host wasnt using a racist expression oreo to describe barack obama during the episode that aired this past weekend but was merely summing up what he believed to be the view of jackson
3886704 the transcript shows that mclaughlin was not expressing his own point of view but jacksons view of obama its clear from both text and context that john mclaughlin is speculating why jesse jackson said what he said about barack obama its jacksons view of obama not mclaughlins she said
3886705 does it frost jackson jesse jackson that someone like obama who fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside that an oreo should be the beneficiary of the long civil rights struggle which jesse jackson spent his lifetime fighting for
3886706 who fits the stereotype blacks once labeled as an oreo a black on the outside a white on the inside
3886707 we take great care in crafting our segments often pre interviewing many people before selecting the ones you see on the air we talked with many bank analysts about last nights discussion the vast majority took the position you heard on the air that indymac bank failure in california is an aberration and that most banks are not in big trouble having said that there are skeptics out there and i take your point that we could have presented that view better please know that we will do many more discussions on the current economic situation including one tonight and one in the works for tomorrow i hope we are able to address your concerns in those finally we do not ever choose guests or segments based on our sponsors that would contradict everything we stand for

3886712 the great american wealth machine that has been cranking out jackpots for the people at the top and pushing working people further down the ladder
3886713 make arguments that would be convincing to someone who doesnt agree with you or else youre just cheerleading
3886714 to objectivity and balance in all programs or series of programs of a controversial nature
3886715 shows that americans consider pbs the nations most trusted institution among nationally known organizations
3886716 included in the program is dr amens prescription to prevent or delay the onset of alzheimers disease
3886717 a major supplier of quality programming to public television stations across the nation
3886718 its 10 on a saturday night and on my local pbs station a diminutive middle aged doctor with a toothy smile and televangelical delivery is facing a rapt studio audience
3886719 before the neurologist in me can voice an objection the doctor daniel amen is being interviewed by on air station kqed host greg sherwood
3886720 if so thats a shame one of the messages of amens pbs special and his book on alzheimers is that early detection of a d can lead to methods that both slow the progression of the disease and prevent it but this opinion isnt shared by the vast majority of the medical community despite decades of studies there are at present no definitive long term treatments for a d or its prevention as amen would have viewers and readers believe
3886721 the same criticism surely applies to those pbs stations that aired change your brain change your life without internal review or audience notification that no program review had been performed at the least the stations should simultaneously display a disclaimer indicating that the programs contents havent been specifically vetted by pbs without such a disclaimer anyone watching a pbs aired program must assume a caveat emptor default position
3886722 preventing alzheimers was only 10 minutes of the 60 minute show
3886723 the science behind preventing alzheimers disease is described in detail in preventing alzheimers which was published by putnam in 2004 and co authored by neurologist william r shankle dr shankle is one of the recognized worlds experts on alzheimers disease who developed one of the commonly used screening tools for alzheimers disease preventing alzheimers contains an extensive reference list 86 citations
3886724 pbs however makes no judgment as to the suitability for broadcast of programs distributed by parties other than pbs
3886725 to avoid misleading the public producers also should adhere to the principles of transparency and honesty by providing appropriate labels disclaimers updates or other information so that the public plainly understands what it is seeing
3886726 would not have a prayer of learning about on commercial television
3886727 a whiff of counter arguments interpretations and opposing analysis of the facts
3886728 on the one hand he comes at issues especially in his commentary from a clearly liberal or center left position although he also at times reminds us of conservative support for some of those same themes
3886729 moyers fails to provide even a whiff of counter arguments interpretations and opposing analysis of the facts and thats what has bothered me about some previous programs
3886730 inside the middle class bad times hit the good life
3886731 fewer americans now than at any time in the past half century believe theyre moving forward in life americans feel stuck in their tracks a majority of survey respondents say that in the past five years they either havent moved forward in life 25 or have fallen backward 31
3886732 the italics are mine to emphasize the strength of what pew was reporting
3886733 when asked to measure their progress over a longer time frame americans are more upbeat nearly two thirds say they have a higher standard of living than their parents had when their parents were their age
3886734 economic demographic technological and sociological changes since 1970 have moved some groups up the income ladder and pushed others down winners include seniors ages 65 and older blacks native born hispanics and married adults the income status of all of these groups improved from 1970 to 2006 losers include young adults ages 18 to 29 the never married foreign born hispanics and people with a high school diploma or less all of these groups have seen their relative income positions decline
3886735 nonetheless these downbeat appraisals both of personal progress and of middle class well being in general are not the publics only perspectives on this matter
3886736 all of these economics trends stagnation in the short term rising prosperity and rising inequality in the long term provide a context for the nuances of public opinion on the subject of the squeeze when survey respondents say they havent moved forward in recent years the economic data say theyre right when respondents say theyre doing better than their parents the economic data say theyre right when respondents say it has become more difficult to maintain a middle class standard of living the data once again say theyre right if what they mean is that it has become harder for people in the middle to keep pace with those above them
3886737 ask americans how the economy is doing and their answer is stark it is not just bad it is run for the hills terrible
3886738 but the reality is different according to most broad measures of how the economy is doing its not all that grim
3886739 this paradox has created a unique challenge for those guiding the economy who worry that americans pessimistic views will become a self fulfilling prophecy
3886740 a couple other developments that are worth remarking even though they happened at the beginning of the week and it now seems like a long time ago al gore came out of the closet here and endorsed we dont know where hes been exactly
3886741 come on he came out and he endorsed barack obama hes a big democrat he was the nominee of the party in 2000 what took him so long and does it make a difference
3886742 a couple other developments that are worth remarking even though they happened at the beginning and it now seems like a long time ago al gore endorsed
3886743 our program on june 20 was indeed taped before a live audience in atlanta and in fact gwen made an innocuous remark leading into a discussion of al gores endorsement of barack obama
3886744 mr peyser contacted us a second time asking why there wasnt mention in the transcript of audience reaction to gwens comment and that of one panelist our associate producer thinking mr peyser might have been offended and in an attempt to be sensitive made the decision on her own to edit the transcript mr peyser took issue with that after a discussion with gwen the transcript was restored as originally posted gwen also contacted mr peyser to explain her position as gwen noted the transcript should not have been changed and rest assured we will see that it doesnt happen again
3886745 public television is made possible by a remarkable public private partnership involving individuals businesses state and federal governments foundations and educational institutions
3886746 federal statutes require that program funders be disclosed on the air at the time of a broadcast and pbs has developed strict guidelines to which national underwriters must adhere the pbs underwriting guidelines can be found online at
3886747 our underwriting credits announcements consume a fraction of the time the networks dedicate to commercial television over a full hour pbs runs only about 5 minutes of underwriting announcements and promotion while the networks run as much as 17 minutes or more of non programming content beyond our guidelines for underwriting credits our non commercial mission is seen in our content which is chosen for its quality rather than its commercial appeal to advertisers

3886757 to the public these men are members of a familiar fraternity presented tens of thousands of times on television and radio as military analysts whose long service has equipped them to give authoritative and unfettered judgments about the most pressing issues of the post sept 11 world
3886758 hidden behind that appearance of objectivity though is a pentagon information apparatus that has used those analysts in a campaign to generate favorable news coverage of the administrations wartime performance the effort which began with the buildup to the iraq war and continues to this day has sought to exploit ideological and military allegiances and also a powerful financial dynamic most of the analysts have ties to military contractors vested in the very war policies they are asked to assess on air those business relationships are hardly ever disclosed to the viewers and sometimes not even to the networks themselves but collectively
3886759 represent more than 150 military contractors either as lobbyists senior executives board members or consultants
3886760 analysts have been wooed in hundreds of private briefings with senior military leaders including officials with significant influence over contracting and budget matters records show they have been taken on tours of iraq and given access to classified intelligence they have been briefed by officials from the white house state department and justice department in turn members of this group have echoed administration talking points sometimes even when they suspected the information was false or inflated some analysts acknowledge they suppressed doubts because they feared jeopardizing their access a few expressed regret for participating in what they regarded as an effort to dupe the american public with propaganda dressed as independent military analysis
3886761 many analysts strongly denied that they had either been co opted or had allowed outside business interests to affect their on air comments and some have used their platforms to criticize the conduct of the war
3886762 many analysts said network officials were only dimly aware of these interactions the networks they said have little grasp of how often they meet with senior officials or what is discussed some networks publish biographies on their web sites that describe their analysts military backgrounds and in some cases give at least limited information about their business ties but many analysts also said the networks asked few questions about their outside business interests the nature of their work or the potential for that work to create conflicts of interest analysts said their network handlers also raised no objections when the defense department began paying their commercial airfare for pentagon sponsored trips to iraq a clear ethical violation for most news organizations
3886763 some e mail messages between the pentagon and the analysts reveal an implicit trade of privileged access for favorable coverage robert h scales jr a retired army general and analyst for fox news and national public radio whose consulting company advises several military firms on weapons and tactics used in iraq wanted the pentagon to approve high level briefings for him inside iraq in 2006 recall the stuff i did after my last visit
3886764 currently a consultant to the pentagon and receives regular briefings there
3886765 he visited iraq this past october under the auspices of the pentagon
3886766 we contacted six of the highest ranking republicans on the house armed services committee to talk about the dont ask dont tell policy all declined interviews the pentagon also declined when we asked for a spokesperson on gays in the military pentagon officials pointed us to retired army lt col robert maginnis
3886767 is a senior strategist with the us army in the pentagon which is a contracted position with bcp international limited an alexandria va based company since october of 2002 col maginnis has been a member of the secretary of defenses retired military analysts group
3886768 no defense industry ties and no fondness for the administration
3886769 as far as we know during the first hot phase of the iraq war the newshour never put on as guests and certainly not in solo slots any of the retired military people mentioned in the new york times as far as we can determine none of our military analysts during the war came to our studios armed with talking points directly from secretary rumsfeld and torie clarke the former assistant secretary of defense for public affairs who oversaw the departments dealing with the retired officer analysts further we believe that any review of our programming during that time would show that colonels lang and gardiner supplemented by colonels warden anderson and davis all of whom were on monthly retainer provided the most astringent and astute analysis of the war seen on american television
3886770 we are always working to make sure we are as transparent as possible in spelling out the current roles of our guests either financial or political
3886771 spoke with him tuesday april 29 and he sounded quite strong he is making rapid progress according to his doctors and may be released from the hospital later this week he told me he was amazed at how much has changed in the field of heart surgery since his first operation 25 years ago we still dont know exactly when hell be ready to come back to work but it should be a matter of weeks not months
3886772 wright suggesting the terrorist attacks of 9 11 were payback for american policy repeating the canard heard often in black communities that the u s government spread hiv in those communities seemingly calling on god to damn america
3886773 when people saw the sound bites from it this year they were upset because you seemed to be blaming america did you somehow fail to communicate
3886774 thought he was blaming america where did anyone get that idea

3886782 wir sollten besser eine vers hnliche als einen konfrontative herangehensweise annehmen um dem land stabilit t zu bringen
3886783 you have to be there it is a major sales event it is advertising
3886784 you want to be there to be a conduit for information because clearly we have controversial issues in canada and the last thing that we want to be is shy we stand behind our technology
3886785 what we need now is an objective discussion and accountability and this doesnt seem to be creating the proper context for what needs to be a very frank and open debate
3886786 right now we have officers that are being called into question because of controversial uses
3886787 the rage right now is that people are recording police officers with their cellphones
3886788 the single most important thing is modified mandatory and enforceable reliability standards in the united states and we are working towards that in all of the provinces of canada
3886789 in ontario theres very little that has changed since the blackout because frankly we were already there
3886790 if we continue with our current centralized energy system were vulnerable to power mishaps
3886791 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3886792 hes in very critical condition the family is doing the best they can theyre shocked like the rest of us
3886793 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3886794 our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3886795 while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3886796 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3886797 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3886798 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3886799 lebanon and the lebanese will not kneel or submit to the criminals and the terrorists
3886800 against the hands that try to disrupt its security and stability
3886801 violence such as this is unacceptable and must not be allowed to undermine the recent steps lebanon has taken toward increased political stability and security
3886802 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3886803 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3886804 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kind of hokey but its the truth
3886805 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3886806 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3886807 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3886808 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3886809 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3886810 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3886811 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3886812 i was in the pool i was in the pool
3886813 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3886814 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3886815 during the alpha test phase testers will be focused into specific towns so we can have miniature stress tests each week they will be able to exprerience all of our game systems including missinos combat crafting scavenging economy and vehicles we are extremely excited to move from general content creation to game balance and bug fixing
3886816 cancellation rates on pending sales are tough to quantify right now normally we see closed sales follow a similar trajectory as pending sales a month or two later we have not seen this same level of correlation recently

3886827 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3886828 the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3886829 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3886830 we have developed a solution that can bridge the gig and 10 gig space this becomes a tremendous vehicle for getting 10 gig deployed without having to pay for it upfront
3886831 it takes all the burden of cost off the motherboard for doing 10 gig
3886832 the most popular one now is sfp because it supports both optical and cable interfaces
3886833 at least for the next year or so sfp will carry the flag for 10 gig
3886834 the first ones we will see are the server oems the storage oems will take a little longer
3886835 i dont think that the storage oems will be announcing any products built on this until the middle of next year
3886836 the basic idea is that 10 gig adoption has been disappointingly slow
3886837 we havent really seen 10 gig take off on mainstream servers
3886838 its interesting that the leaders in gigabit ethernet are broadcom and intel and neither one offers a four port chip now so its a unique product
3886839 the gigabit ethernet market is extremely competitive and broadcom and intel are very entrenched its not an easy matter to displace entrenched competitors
3886840 i respect andy obriens decision and i thank him for letting us know

3886844 i did not kill her i did not have anything to do with her disappearance i am a victim here too
3886845 because im thinking about killing you i have a plan
3886846 divorce granted you can have the kids the house whatever you want baby ill be out by the end of the week

3886848 they have more potential but we have got to go through
3886849 we dont have first team regulars and reserves apart from jens lehmann no player has a guaranteed place
3886850 we are favourites are at home and if we play as we can we will get into the uefa cup
3886851 it is not worth discussing whether this game comes at a good time or not we have got to play it and go through

3886856 island of happiness stays true to the elements of the series that fans love and will provide players an exciting harvest moon universe that will continue to elevate the series to new heights
3886857 tonight was not about tactics or team plans but it was all about a teams desire to win
3886858 it was one of those performances which is the culmination of a lot of hard work the boys have been together now for a long time theyve played a lot of matches and they trained very hard
3886859 they deserve the win it was a good team effort and it there were some really good individual performances
3886860 people back home dont know queen of the south and i cant afford for my players to think that just because its a bit of a trip into the unknown then its going to be an easy ride just because they are in the first division
3886861 i know enough about scottish football to let my players know that if they think like that then its going to be very difficult because they will play with a lot of passion they will work hard
3886862 some of the queens players will have the feeling we might not get this chance again and they will battle they really will
3886863 they will look to spoil our passing game and we are going to have to get used to the physical challenge that is different to what the boys are used to in denmark
3886864 its always a pleasure to be back and this is what i expected
3886865 we wont want to cut up the pitch but we will have a wee kick of the ball
3886866 we will have to adapt to the playing surface and its definitely not going to be used as an excuse if the pitch is going to be wet
3886867 so far i have been quite happy with our play but we didnt win and that puts a bit more pressure on us of course
3886868 this is a new contract with valencia with different conditions
3886869 there is a total agreement with the club and the player david silva for him to continue with us for the next five seasons
3886870 we have not listened to any offer for him we have always expressed the opinion and the desire that he stays with us and if we have not listened to anything until now then we will not do so from now on either
3886871 the following step will be to try for david villa to remain with us but i must remind you that the player is ours and he has a contract
3886872 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation as i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds
3886873 the board asked him astengo to step down because we believe the results the team have collected are not the best
3886874 this is a dell developed operating environment that is sub processor
3886875 it uses all of the major system ingredients that youd want for something like this it gives you the keyboard the screen its got control of the radio we see this as another mode of the computer

3886878 the increased participation in fa panamax over the years underscores the importance the international community places on cooperative efforts and strong partnerships as pillars of worldwide security and stability

3886884 hasta hace unos a os predominaban las interferencias graves como la persecuci n la censura directa o el asesinato de periodistas ahora esas formas est n en retirada afortunadamente y afloran otras menos ostensibles pero igualmente da inas
3886885 el precio del silencio uso y abuso de la publicidad oficial y otras formas de censura indirecta en am rica latina
3886886 no podemos decir que el criterio fue tomar los casos peores de ninguna manera
3886887 muchos gobiernos de la regi n utilizan sistem ticamente contratos publicitarios para recompensar o castigar a medios por sus contenidos
3886888 no hay normas que proh ban espec ficamente la discriminaci n
3886889 aqu el gobierno pretende darte un contrato de publicidad para callarte la boca
3886890 el gobierno nacional suele hacer pagos generosos en concepto de publicidad a periodistas de medios gr ficos nacionales influyentes que tienen programas de radio o televisi n por cable con bajos niveles de audiencia
3886891 el gobierno nacional abusa sistem ticamente de sus facultades en materia de publicidad oficial y asignaci n excesiva de pauta a medios afines
3886892 autocensura que inhibe a redacciones enteras y es capaz de acallar hasta a los periodistas m s valientes

3886896 the sensible route is to use section 1132 a 2 to get the money in the first instance from a solvent party liable to make good on the loss not from the plan itself
3886897 the plan would recover money that could only properly be allocated to people no longer in the plan
3886898 it is unclear what the plan would be entitled to do with the money if we are to take the trust law analogy seriously then the recovered funds must go to to the people actually sustaining losses
3886899 courage demonstrates that both treatment strategies can have a profoundly positive effect on patients health status and suggests complementary roles optimal medical therapy as first line therapy with pci reserved for patients who do not have a response or who have severe baseline symptoms

3886901 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
3886902 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 percent
3886903 the 6 month survival rate was 100 percent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 percent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
3886904 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead

3886907 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3886908 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3886909 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3886923 estas loco pablo las muxas letras te han vuelto loco
3886924 este pueblo de labios me honra pero su corazon esta lejos de mi
3886925 en cuanto a ti hijo de hombre los hijos de tu pueblo se mofan de ti junto a las paredes y a las puertas de las casas y habla uno con el otro cada uno con su hermano diciendo venid ahora y oid qu palabra viene de jehova y vienen a ti como viene el pueblo y estanh delante de ti como pueblo mio oyen tus palabras pero no las ponen por obra antes hacen halagos con sus bocas y el coraz n de ellos anda en pos de su avaricia y t eres para ellos como un cantor de amores de hermosa voz y que canta bien ellos oyen tus palabras pero no las ponen por obra
3886926 poned la mira en las cosas de arriba no en las de la tierra porque habeis muerto y vuestra vida esta escondida con cristo en dios
3886927 no cesamos de orar por vosotros y de pedir que seais llenos del conocimiento de su voluntad en toda sabiduria e inteligencia espiritual asi podreis andar como es digno del se or agradandolo en todo llevando fruto en toda buena obra y creciendo en el conocimiento de dios fortalecidos con todo poder conforme a la potencia de su gloria obtendreis fortaleza y paciencia
3886928 sed sobrios y velad porque vuestro adversario el diablo como le n rugiente anda alrededor buscando a quien devorar resistidlo firmes en la fe sabiendo que los mismos padecimientos se van cumpliendo en vuestros hermanos en todo el mundo
3886929 y el dios de paz aplastar muy pronto a satanas bajo vuestros pies
3886930 porque todo lo que es nacido de dios vence al mundo y esta es la victoria que ha vencido al mundo nuestra fe quien es el que vence al mundo sino el que cree que jesus es el hijo de dios
3886931 i am hugely disappointed not to be able to attend the festival of politics this year as it was something i was looking forward to immensely
3886932 once i am back on my feet it will be my imperative to come back up to edinburgh at the earliest opportunity
3886933 for decades annie lennox has put the health of women in africa at the heart of her work
3886934 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity that has gone seriously wrong
3886935 why else do you think we are facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3886936 the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3886937 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3886938 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
3886939 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3886940 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3886941 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
3886942 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
3886943 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering
3886944 one of the things i think is most significant about this platform is that it recognizes that there is more than one way to discourage abortion
3886945 is not intended and never was intended to close the american mind or for that matter the catholic mind to different or alternative ways to discourage abortion
3886946 health care education income support adoption to catholics these are also pro life issues and moral issues theyre common good issues so as a catholic and a feminist id say its not only about womens choice its not only about entitlement programs but its about the goal of enabling all women with their children to be full participants in our society
3886947 many of the issues that impact on abortion such as hunger and poverty lack of health care racism are not optional for catholic voters they are part of the agenda of human life and they must not be neglected so theres a strong catholic basis for affirming much of this platform
3886948 an obligation and prerogative to work in all kinds of ways to protect the unborn and to protect women and families using the art of the possible
3886949 is an excellent example of the art of the possible
3886950 and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3886951 such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3886952 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
3886953 really reached out to leaders of the evangelical and catholic communities
3886954 barack obamas campaign and the democratic party have taken a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives by supporting mothers whose will and conscience tells them to carry their babies to term
3886955 its less than we want but its a great deal more than many people expected
3886956 the interpretation of the platform is in the hands of the candidate barack obama
3886957 we can reduce abortion dramatically maybe between 50 to 70 percent if we address these concerns
3886958 we know that abortion reduction measures aimed at the root causes actually work
3886959 i wanted to sign a five year deal because having just turned 30 i feel ive got more than five years left in me
3886960 i pride myself on my fitness and my training and i feel these will be the best five years of my career to come
3886961 i set out to improve every year as a player i feel as fit as ive ever felt and i train as hard as ive ever trained this contract will take me to 34 and if you look around there are a lot of top professionals playing like ryan giggs offering a lot to their club both on the pitch and off it and i certainly feel that i can do that in a big way
3886962 i think it helped coming back training at chelsea seeing my team mates seeing the manager feeling comfortable among the lads
3886963 the man united game and what they did there was a big thing
3886964 when you go to your mums funeral you dont expect all the players to go there you might expect a representative from the club i had all the lads there and thats something that goes beyond football and shows you what real friendships are
3886965 i think its important because it makes a statement about us keeping our best players
3886966 i am delighted because it is an honour to go and represent east africa in one of the best fashion finale in the world
3886967 many people do not know about tanzania but i will use this chance to interact with best designers so that they can come and see what tanzania can offer
3886968 i was very sad to hear of the death of john macdougall and my thoughts are with his wife cathy and children julie and scott at this difficult time
3886969 john was an excellent mp and will be sadly missed by colleagues of all parties he was a doughty fighter for the people of fife over many years as a trade unionist long standing councillor and dedicated member of parliament
3886970 john had above all a caring attitude but he also had a very good sense of humour and that sense of humour always helped to cut through many difficult political situations
3886971 john gave over a quarter of a century of service to the people of fife as a councillor and as an mp he was always ready to argue passionately for what he believed in but respected the right of others to disagree with him
3886972 he also went out of his way to acknowledge the work done by councillors of all parties in looking after their constituents despite his failing health john showed great courage and determination in continuing to work for the people he represented
3886973 i know i speak for every one associated with local government in fife when i offer my deepest sympathies to cathy scott and julie and to the rest of johns family
3886974 john was a kind and decent man who dedicated to the service of the people of fife with distinguished service both in parliament and local government
3886975 i have greatly admired the way in which he has borne such a debilitating illness with enormous courage my thoughts are with his family and friends
3886976 both as a councillor and as a member of parliament john macdougall embodied the best traditions of public service

3887011 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3887012 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3887013 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3887014 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3887015 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3887016 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3887017 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3887018 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father

3887056 it is worrying that a self styled nutritionist and healthcare professional who lacks any accredited university level qualifications in nutrition or medicine is able to make such irresponsible strong misleading and unjustified claims for the cancer curing properties of vitamin c while also promoting his own brand of vitamin c pills
3887057 theres a mineral called chromium that a lot of us dont get enough of and diabetics in particular if they supplement more chromium that helps control blood sugar and so too does cinammon so the combination of a low gl diet plus some cinnamon and chromium tends to make a big difference
3887058 holford therefore appears to be promoting his branded supplement pills as a treatment for diabetes a serious medical condition the evidence for the efficacy of cinnamon and chromium in diabetes management is extremely limited and the little that exists is not a strong argument for efficacy

3887062 i am hearing from people who talk directly to the obama campaign that colin powell will endorse senator obama and he may well give a speech at the democratic national convention explaining his endorsement of obama kristol who also is a contributor to fox news said on the cable news channel today
3887063 people are very confident that powell will endorse obama and they think it may well be the case that powell will speak on wednesday at the democratic convention kristol added

3887071 i think the scalability of some of these u s brands into international markets has been a big factor
3887072 specifically if you look at facebook and hi5 what theyre doing in terms of foreign language interface translation and their emphasis on cultural relevance in each of the markets theyre expanding to has helped them grow pretty dramatically across all global regions
3887073 translation opens the door and all the other things follow
3887074 they didnt offer translations until this year facebook was behind the curve not as localized as myspace or hi5
3887075 they were doing very well in the english speaking world but not until providing localized content could they tap into that growth
3887076 we have a member translation tool that allows users to translate different words it helps with colloquialisms and slang and different spellings of words and those get captured and flagged by users and then the community votes on the accuracy
3887077 even though many are u s based in terms of overall usage the u s market is a pretty mature market
3887078 its not going to sustain the level of growth its seen over the past few years but its definitely an audience to grow if you emphasize these global regions

3887083 individuals and organizations with 25 or more trucks tractors or other heavy vehicles used on highways now are required to make their excise tax filings with the internal revenue service electronically rather than by paper form 2290 heavy highway vehicle use tax return is used to report and pay highway use excise taxes last year truckers and others filed over 700 000 forms 2290 and paid over 1 billion in federal highway use taxes e filing of form 2290 began in august 2007 electronic filing streamlines the processing of the form 2290 is more safe and reliable than paper filing and reduces preparation and processing errors although electronically filing form 2290 is not required for taxpayers reporting fewer than 25 vehicles all taxpayers are encouraged to file their forms electronically most forms 2290 are due by august 31 another advantage of e filing form 2290 is that taxpayers dont have to wait for a stamped version of the schedule 1 schedule of heavy highway vehicles to be returned by mail because they will almost instantly receive the equivalent of a stamped version electronically this means truckers wont have to wait to register their vehicles with the appropriate state authority when obtaining the proper license tags

3887086 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3887087 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3887088 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3887090 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3887091 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3887092 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3887093 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3887094 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3887095 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3887096 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3887097 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3887098 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3887099 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3887100 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3887101 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3887102 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3887103 who are open to doing something on the production side
3887104 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3887105 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3887106 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3887107 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3887108 if youre a senior citizen and earn less than 50 000 a year barack obama has a deal for you a life free of federal income tax sounds appealing right maybe to many seniors but tax policy experts in washington are giving it bad reviews they see it as another subsidy for senior citizens who already get federal help through social security and medicare and often have economic advantages over other demographic groups seniors typically have paid off their mortgages many have investments and usually dont pay taxes on their social security benefits the kids are usually grown so theyre not saddled with day care or college costs the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving said clint stretch managing principal of tax policy for deloitte tax the obama campaign says the idea would give tax cuts averaging about 1 400 to 7 million seniors who are battling inflation with mostly fixed incomes the campaign also says the plan would relieve millions of older people from having to file complicated tax returns
3887109 two thirds of u s corporations paid no federal income taxes between 1998 and 2005 according to a new report from congress
3887110 our demand has skyrocketed but our ability to supply that demand has stagnated
3887111 this is a fact today barack obama is subject to what is probably the greatest concentrated attacks of smears lies and innuendo in the lifetime of anyone who reads these words
3887112 were excited to have john on board and heading this important new initiative for perkins logistics
3887113 his experience in running cost effective and service oriented operations without sacrificing productivity or on time delivery is of great value to us we believe with the addition of john well be able to offer a more complete line of services for the specialized markets we serve
3887114 it was an extremely hard decision for the committee to narrow the list of finalists to these eight cities and it will be an even more difficult decision to determine the five cities that will serve as future hosts for the womens final four
3887115 the eight finalists are a blend of cities that have hosted the womens final four in the past and those that are possible hosts for the first time it will be the committees charge over the next three months to make the final determination in regard to which will be the best future host sites for the marquee event for womens basketball
3887116 were happy we can give voters of south dakota more choice in november
3887117 choice is what elections are made of and we were able to overcome extremely rigid ballot access laws in order to give voters this choice

3887119 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced all the government is waiting for is madonna to forward the petition of adoption formalities then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3887120 the adoption process in malawi is so long and stressful that all the legal wrangling put a huge strain on their marriage
3887121 they dropped proceedings to pour all their energies into each other but madonna now feels they are stable enough to press ahead with the adoption again
3887122 we know that it is mercy who madonna really wants we heard it is because my granddaughter is such a beautiful happy child twice i have told the adoption people that i do not want mercy to go outside the country but they keep on at us now they say that mercy will be leaving us but can return at age 18 yet i might not be alive then
3887123 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3887124 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3887125 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
3887126 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
3887127 it was a mistake to launch first impressions how did apples supply chain fare during the 3g rollout
3887128 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
3887129 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
3887130 its ok to have problems as long as you admit to them and fix them in fact if you admit to them and fix them it turns out to be an effect that creates more intense loyalty than you would expect
3887131 ive seen a number of issues with apple that would stop other vendors in their tracks and people are willing to give apple a break there
3887132 an intoxicating mix of brilliant industrial design transcendent software interfaces and consumable goods that are purely digital
3887133 apple could have stumbled meeting demand or failed on quality it did neither
3887134 when the itunes activation server went down on friday morning apple violated the cardinal rule first do no harm
3887135 fraught with problems including large initial downtime an extended e mail outage including lost messages the inability to contact the service to sync corruption of data time delays in syncing the computer to mobileme and more
3887136 apple has always made great products and they always expect to be phenomenally successful at launch but i think the appetite in the public for this kind of product is probably surprising
3887137 but this one may have some effects thanks to the outsized press coverage that apple launches typically command
3887138 even the most ardent appleophiles may choose to wait a week or two before purchasing new products the next time around
3887139 this would not only spread out sales it could actually weaken them the initial product rush would be less of an event the pr impact and press coverage would be muted and thus apples brand would not enjoy quite the same status and some sales could be lost
3887140 we appreciate the enthusiasm of our developers and were excited that youre so passionate about the android platform thanks for taking the time to send this
3887141 sounds like a polite way of saying nothing a verbal silence
3887142 they are selling technology into a space that is need to have and must have technology to keep businesses running
3887143 i want to apologize for the disruption and difficulty this issue may have caused to our customers and our partners
3887144 we failed in not disabling the code in the final release of update 2 and not catching it in our quality assurance process
3887145 we have kicked off a comprehensive in depth review of our qa and release processes and will quickly make the needed changes
3887146 i updated one of my five hosts and everything appears to be fine so far
3887147 thanks for all the hard work getting this patch out
3887148 unfortunately i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back a little bit
3887149 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3887150 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with
3887151 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
3887152 the esx i 3 5 update 2 power on problem that surfaced today is not related to exploitation of a security issue on esx
3887153 several customers have been worried that their esx systems had been compromised by an attack and that this was the cause for not booting of their esx update 2 virtual machines today
3887154 vmware esx server in the enterprise planning and securing virtualization servers
3887155 in terms of stability the mainframe is probably the best machine for transaction crunching we service 2 000 end users at any given time so having that kind of flexibility provides us with the ability to continue to support the health care environment while the mainframe processes applications and passes them down to other systems
3887156 the mainframe is getting smaller and smaller and the scalability just keeps getting better
3887157 there is a place for the mainframe and there is a place for distributed systems people in the industry are finding ways to make these work better together but the mainframe is a very reliable machine and the distributed system just a junior still trying to grow up and be the mainframe
3887158 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3887159 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3887160 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3887161 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3887162 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3887163 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3887164 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3887165 of what works and what needs correction thus leverage our considerable member base to influence sap to either change the costs or change the offerings as appropriate
3887166 we want to continue to help influence this but it is not our position to demand a set dollar amount from sap
3887167 we cant go in there and say were going to demand that prices are only going to be at 17 percent because then were acting as a collective bargaining organization and we dont have the legal right to do that
3887168 share that data among members to establish a baseline and increase transparency of ownership costs as legally permitted segment by industry size region version number you can then figure out the money spent to date and the value realized to date
3887169 i have one question wheres all the talent going to come from and if you could find the talent would they want to be sitting on the support desk
3887170 nobody jumps up and down and says i called sap and got a great answer
3887171 when you get onto sap support desk and tell them that ive always thought they really rallied
3887172 but the people in maintenance mode what are they going to use what are they going to need
3887173 i can tell you we are talking absolutely with the top 10 and 20 in saps maintenance base in terms of dollars
3887174 the question we havent yet answered is will we be in a position to take care of everybody or take a small group of customers initially and then go gangbusters in january 2010
3887175 we dont put people on the road we allow them to live anywhere in the country or outside of it if appropriate
3887176 weve really been able to get people with 10 to 15 years of experience or more i think were going to find the same thing in the sap environment
3887177 customers have shown a preference for wanting support to come from the manufacturer
3887178 we start from the premise that we already have the worlds largest support infrastructure
3887179 we have a lot of confidence if i was a third party support company starting from scratch id be looking at an uphill battle
3887180 the gold medal for atos is not to be visible at all
3887181 if we pop up then something happened that was not planned
3887182 its not a question of marketing and publicity we are not a consumer company
3887183 were integrating so many suppliers we have no control over
3887184 you cant use the contract and incentives to motivate people in the same way
3887185 i have not seen a great willingness yet by these companies to do that
3887186 fire eagle is a way for people to take their location to the web
3887187 essentially fire eagle is nothing more nothing less than a store for a users location
3887188 whats more interesting is how it works as a switchboard
3887189 fire eagle solved all the hard problems with location for us
3887190 it makes it easier for bloggers to have correct location information on their blog within their posts being able to geo tag their content
3887191 obviously fire eagle is crucial to the success of what were trying to do
3887192 there are other tools that identify location but none that do it in specifically this way
3887193 the attention to privacy is noteworthy as is the concept behind fire eagle the challenge will be to build user awareness and adoption in the near term
3887194 command you would only have to press option b three times and get the cursor on
3887195 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3887196 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3887197 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3887198 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3887199 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3887200 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3887201 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3887202 o diogo n o foi a itu com o aval da diretoria ele est treinando aqui em s o paulo se nenhuma proposta aparecer ele ser reintegrado na segunda feira

3887204 estamos profundamente tristes com a not cia de que bill gwatney faleceu
3887205 a cirurgia estava marcada para esta quarta feira mas conversei com o doutor braga e expliquei que n o estava sentindo dor por isso achamos melhor deixar para realiz la nas f rias
3887206 n o temos conseguido os resultados mas teremos uma nova oportunidade com o in cio do segundo turno s depende da gente temos que seguir trabalhando
3887207 um jogador que pode atuar em algumas fun es diferentes vamos precisar achar outro atleta com essa caracter stica para essas pr ximas semanas
3887208 and this in the fall will give you outrageous color
3887209 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3887210 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3887211 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3887212 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3887213 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3887214 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3887215 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3887216 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3887217 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3887218 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3887219 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3887220 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3887221 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3887222 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3887223 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3887224 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3887225 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3887226 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3887227 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3887228 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3887229 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3887230 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3887231 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3887232 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3887233 based on what we have around the house it looks like were going to go for death by vodka maybe tequila with a 100 humane rating i think thats how well send him off hes been a good
3887234 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3887235 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3887236 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3887237 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

3887246 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3887247 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3887248 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3887249 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3887250 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3887251 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3887252 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3887253 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3887254 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3887255 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3887256 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3887257 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3887258 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3887259 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3887260 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3887261 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3887262 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3887263 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3887264 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3887265 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3887266 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3887267 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3887268 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3887269 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3887270 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3887271 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

3887312 much progress has been made to date in removing or reducing thimerosal in vaccines new pediatric formulations of hepatitis b vaccines have been licensed by the fda recombivax hb merck thimerosal free in august 1999 and engerix b glaxo smithkline thimerosal free in january 2007
3887313 before the product was converted to totally thimerosal free it had trace levels of thimerosal
3887314 were all vaccinated multiple times in early childhood the only vaccination my kids got that i didnt was hep b were the vaccinations i got toxin free and somehow that changed for the worse over the past 40 years
3887315 you might want to ask the thousands of parents of chidren affected with regressive autism
3887316 trace amounts in those that do contain them can also have a cummulative effect on the bodys ability to process and excrete toxins
3887317 it would take a complete imbecile someone extremely naive or someone in big pharmas big pockets not to see there is a huge conflict of interest
3887318 in new york only one out of 40 doctors offices confirmed that they report a death or injury following vaccination
3887319 pertussis associated mortality is currently very low in industrialised countries and no difference can be discerned when countries with high low and zero immunisation rates were compared
3887320 vaccination causes significant death and disability at an astounding personal and financial cost to uninformed families
3887321 among school aged children measles outbreaks have occurred in schools with vaccination levels of greater than 98 percent 24 they have occurred in all parts of the country including areas that had not reported measles for years
3887322 the apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population measles becomes a disease of immunized persons
3887323 produces immune suppression which contributes to an increased susceptibility to other infections
3887324 evidence suggests that vaccination is an unreliable means of preventing disease
3887325 vaccines are the reason for low disease rates in the u
3887326 from 1911 to 1935 the four leading causes of childhood deaths from infectious diseases in the u s were diphtheria pertussis scarlet fever and measles however by 1945 the combined death rates from these causes had declined by 95 percent before the implementation of mass immunization programs
3887327 it is unclear what impact if any that vaccines had on 19th and 20th century infectious disease declines
3887328 many of the assumptions upon which immunization theory and practice are based are unproven or have been proven false in their application
3887329 the disease was very mild no one died and no one went to the intensive care unit
3887330 reactivate later in life in the form of herpes zoster shingles or other immune system disorders
3887331 until we actually know the risks involved in injecting mutated dna the vaccine herpes virus into the host genome children
3887332 dangers of childhood diseases are greatly exaggerated in order to scare parents into compliance with a questionable but highly profitable procedure
3887333 polio was one of the clearly great vaccination success stories
3887334 the polio vaccine temporarily reversed disease declines that were underway before the vaccine was introduced this fact was deliberately covered up by health authorities in europe polio declined in countries that both embraced and rejected the vaccine
3887335 my child had no reaction to the vaccines so there is nothing to worry about
3887336 causing a low grade encephalitis in infants on a much wider scale than public health authorities were willing to admit about 15 20 of all children
3887337 the incidence of many other chronic immunological diseases including asthma allergies and immune mediated cancers has risen rapidly and may also be linked to immunisation
3887338 the long term adverse effects of vaccinations have been ignored in spite of compelling correlations with many serious chronic conditions doctors cant explain the dramatic rise in many of these diseases
3887339 documented safe and effective alternatives to vaccination have been available for decades
3887340 legal exemptions from vaccinations are available for many but not all u s citizens
3887341 public health officials always place the publics health above all other concerns
3887342 moratorium on vaccine mandates and for physicians to insist upon truly informed consent for the use of vaccines
3887343 increasing numbers of mandatory childhood vaccines to which children are subjected without information about potential adverse side effects
3887344 safety testing of many vaccines is limited and the data are unavailable for independent scrutiny so that mass vaccination is equivalent to human experimentation and subject to the nuremberg code which requires voluntary informed consent
3887345 the process of approving and recommending vaccines is tainted with conflicts of interest
3887346 it is clear that the governments immunization policies are driven by politics and not by science i can give numerous examples where employees of the us public health service appear to be furthering their careers by acting as propaganda officers to support political agendas in one case employees of a foreign government who were funded and working closely with the us public health service submitted false data to a major medical journal the true data indicated the vaccine was dangerous however the false data that was submitted indicated there was no risk an employee of the nih who manages large vaccine grants jointly published a misleading letter about the subject with one of these foreign civil servants as you are aware it is illegal to falsify data from research funded by the us government
3887347 to determine if public health officials are following the laws enacted to ensure vaccines are safe
3887348 if public health officials along with manufacturers are misleading the public about the safety of these products
3887349 four letters from the fda public health service clearly reveal that the anthrax vaccine was approved for marketing without the manufacturer performing a single controlled clinical trial
3887350 many of the public health officials who determine vaccine policy profit substantially from their policy decisions
3887351 the medical authorities keep lying vaccination has been a disaster on the immune system it actually causes a lot of illnesses we are actually changing our genetic code through vaccination 100 years from now we will know that the biggest crime against humanity was vaccines
3887352 there is no evidence whatsoever of the ability of vaccines to prevent any diseases to the contrary there is a great wealth of evidence that they cause serious side effects
3887353 my data proves that the studies used to support immunization are so flawed that it is impossible to say if immunization provides a net benefit to anyone or to society in general this question can only be determined by proper studies which have never been performed the flaw of previous studies is that there was no long term follow up and chronic toxicity was not looked at the american society of microbiology has promoted my research and thus acknowledges the need for proper studies
3887354 when you see a comment more than five screens worth long you know youre dealing with a hysterical zealot
3887355 what do you mean that youre not sure if these vaccines are causing harm
3887356 i agree with the statement of bernadine healy former director of the national institutes of health who said
3887357 lending levels continue to be lower than last year and any recovery is still some way away with little sign of the special liquidity scheme increasing the flow of funds to the industry or lowering the cost of funds as hoped
3887358 if the purpose of charter change is to accommodate the memorandum of agreement between the philippine government and the moro islamic liberation front milf it should be stopped by any means and i mean any
3887359 yeah somebody is tied up and drugged in the back of that van
3887360 shes so tiny i could fold her up and put her in my pocket
3887361 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3887362 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3887363 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3887364 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3887365 minc is blowing a lot of smoke and pretending his agency is demanding a lot of rigorous measures
3887366 were dealing with a principal tributary of the amazon which has maybe the highest biodiversity of fish and among the highest biodiversity of birds in the world
3887367 if an accord does not happen the government could take the initiative to build the two works through eletrobras
3887368 the brazilian government really wants to get these projects done because of concerns about potential power shortages
3887369 my sense of this is that both companies will defend their interests and you might have legal action but therell be some kind of agreement
3887370 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round

3887376 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3887377 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3887378 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3887379 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3887380 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3887381 it will be entirely consistent with labor party policy and the law
3887382 now this story is no matter of mere opinion there is no possibility that obama just has a different opinion on a controversial national issue than we do as daniel patrick moynihan once famously said one is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts what we have here is obama simply telling a lie and knowingly doing so will the old media continue to cover up for him like they have done for the last four years

3887395 reputations kudos and respect all of which are earned in a variety of non capitalist ways
3887396 but for the time being a return to a relatively
3887397 crude oil closed above 80 a barrel for the first time today breaking a longstanding psychological barrier just days after oil producers tried to bring prices down by promising to increase output
3887398 oil prices at 80 a barrel should be a source of happiness to crude oil producing countries but the opec is not happy abdalla el badri opec secretary general said in its first response to the current record prices that oil prices were high and would not last because they are not supported by oil market fundamentals
3887399 to listen to big oil executives theres no reason why a barrel of crude costs 80
3887400 cannot explain why we have 70 oil today we are not having trouble finding oil there is something else going on that i dont get
3887401 its absurd to argue that ending the moratorium on drilling off parts of the u s coasts would quickly bring down the high price of gasoline this chimera is being touted by president george w bush and other republican politicians including the partys presumptive presidential nominee senator john mccain of arizona to deflect blame for what its costing for a fill up to get around the fact that it would be a decade or more before any oil would be likely to flow a few partisan analysts have said that the cost of gasoline would fall right away they argue that the prospect of additional oil supply in the future would lead oil companies to produce more oil immediately because they would expect prices for crude to be lower later on well wouldnt that depend on whether a producer had the capacity to pump more oil today and whether it thought lifting the moratorium would add a significant amount of oil to future supply relative to future demand there are good reasons to question whether another 1 million or 2 million barrels of crude a day would make much difference in prices when world consumption is running at 85 million barrels a day about a fourth of all u s oil production is already coming from offshore wells primarily in the central and western portions of the gulf of mexico that arent covered by the moratorium
3887402 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3887403 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see as a general matter in such cases where disciplinary referrals are appropriate they are made to put it in concrete terms i doubt that anyone in this room would want to trade places with any of those people
3887404 even if sampson was confused or mistaken in his interpretation of the rules that applied to immigration judge hiring we do not believe that would excuse his actions
3887405 his actions which were carried out over a lengthy period of time and were not based on formal advice from anyone systematically violated federal law and department policy and constituted misconduct
3887406 well aware that some people have called on me and on the department to take even more drastic steps than those i have described
3887407 for example some commentators have suggested that we should criminally prosecute the people found in the reports to have committed misconduct
3887408 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3887409 attorney general mukaseys blanket conclusions appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3887410 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3887411 among other things the department now has new hiring processes for immigration judges members of the board of immigration appeals honors program candidates and summer law interns with codified roles for career attorneys in the decision making process
3887412 we have instituted mandatory training for all political appointees regarding merit system principles and prohibited personnel practices and we will shortly be expanding that training to include all department employees whether political appointees or not involved in career hiring and we have revised various orders to reiterate the departments commitment to merit systems principles and to remove political appointees in the attorney generals office from the process of hiring career attorneys
3887413 to the extent we can we intend to contact candidates for the attorney generals honors program who may have been improperly eliminated from consideration and encourage them to apply for any vacancies at the department
3887414 each of them will be assured a fair evaluation similarly we will contact those who may have been improperly denied temporary details to jobs at main justice to see if they are interested in any new opportunities that are or may become available
3887415 there is a principle of equity that we all learned in the schoolyard and that remains as true today as when we first heard it two wrongs do not make a right
3887416 that some of the officials involved in hiring gave improper consideration to politics does not mean that the people they hired are unqualified for their jobs it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire them or to reassign them without individual cause

3887492 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
3887493 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone
3887494 i would prefer to have him remain as stable as he is and be able to enjoy his life i like to go out and pet him its just a matter of feeding and petting him i would be totally lost at the point where he disappears from the scene
3887495 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3887496 its just a symbol of heritage thats from the south and its ancestors that aint got nothing to do with racism
3887497 to stand up for the southland of america just like their ancestors did no matter what the consequences are and say this is not right
3887498 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3887499 we will continue to own and operate industry leading companies invest in existing businesses and maintain a level of financial discipline that ensures we are well positioned for ongoing success
3887500 newspaper businesses are an important part of coxs history and we greatly value the contributions the employees of these companies have made to our company
3887501 if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels
3887502 i dont think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium 3
3887503 but over the long term we do face an energy problem
3887504 this reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering
3887505 helium 3 is present on the moon but in very small concentration levels meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium 3
3887506 our real challenge is not obtaining the helium 3 it is demonstrating that we can burn it
3887507 one should never say never it may come to pass that helium 3 could become an important source of energy in the coming century
3887508 that time has not come yet and i suspect that it is still some time off
3887509 they played eye of the tiger as the bus entered the arena
3887510 liberals like nancy pelosi and charlie brown want to continue supporting federal laws that prevents us from tapping americas vast oil resources thats how we got into this mess and why gasoline prices are now breaking our family budgets
3887511 america has nearly a trillion barrels of recoverable oil more than three times that of saudi arabia that democrats like nancy pelosi and charlie brown wont even let us touch in fact more than 94 percent of our territory remains off limits because of this foolish prohibition if we want to change this policy weve got to change this congress
3887512 meanwhile the vast oil fields off the coast of florida that american law prevents americans from developing are now being drained by the chinese government drilling in cuban waters
3887513 and still nancy pelosi and her supporters in congress continue to block the development of these vast american oil reserves
3887514 hes ok hes just a little stiff we thought it was best to get him out it shouldnt jeopardize anything tuesday i dont think itll be a problem hell just have treatment probably tomorrow and friday and be back in our bullpen saturday
3887515 i definitely wasnt 100 percent sometimes your shoulder stiffens up and you can kind of loosen up a little bit but mine got progressively worse
3887516 ive had it in the past and it you usually give it some time to rest and you bounce back pretty well hope that happens were going to the doc tomorrow and see whats going on in there
3887517 you know when you get a tetanus shot and theres that ache deep in there you feel like somebody punched you in the shoulder real bad thats kind of the feel i couldnt get extension on any of my pitches
3887518 we visited muhammad ibn suqah and he said shall i inform you of something which might avail you because it has been of great help to myself he said ata ibn abu rabah told us
3887519 hi im bella swan once again someone wants to kill me maybe if im vague enough about it youll want to kill me too
3887520 no no its your bachelor party you have to go
3887521 i just didnt want to spend my honeymoon writhing in pain
3887522 i bit a pillow or two thats not what im talking about
3887523 that right there is why im angry you are killing my buzz edward
3887524 im making you unhappy now i dont want to do that
3887525 then dont you be unhappy thats the only thing thats wrong here
3887526 so what positions do you think they did it in tee hee
3887527 no edward im trying to tell you that my period is five days late
3887528 i love the scrapbook you gave me mom and here is a picture of my vampire boyfriend watching espn
3887529 honey i know it hurts when robert sparkleson breaks up with you but in real life youre going to have to deal with it attempted suicide by thug is not
3887530 hi jacob i was wondering if you could help me commit suicide by motorcycle ill never get this thing up and killing me by myself
3887531 i know suicide by cliff diving thatll totally bring edward back
3887532 he looks at me like hes waiting for something like im going to join his stupid gang someday he pays more attention to me than any of the other guys i hate it
3887533 well im so sorry that i cant be the right kind of monster for you bella i guess im just not as great as a bloodsucker am i
3887534 i wasnt supposed to tell you our secret for one thing but the other part is that its not safe for you if i get too mad too upset you might get hurt
3887535 he was a fool to think you could survive alone ive never seen anyone so prone to life threatening idiocy
3887536 i almost get myself killed on a daily basis tell me what i need to do
3887537 honestly i think its all gotten beyond ridiculous im debating whether to just change you myself
3887538 okay bella saving edward and possibly all of vampirekind depends on you not being clumsy for thirty seconds oh fuck were
3887539 they are so rare but i want the whole story
3887540 bella is alive after all and alice is here with her isnt that wonderful
3887541 marcus sees relationships hes surprised by the intensity of ours
3887542 youre very brave edward to endure in silence i asked jane to do that to me once just out of curiosity
3887543 but your restraint edward its amazing colossal it must be almost as hard as it is for teenagers not to have sex which they shouldnt have by the way
3887544 i think shes having hysterics maybe you should slap her
3887545 i knew you could never have loved me because i am ordinary and plain and clumsy
3887546 what i just told you a gigantic sadistic lie that rendered you catatonic for six months why are you not believing a single word i say now
3887547 you could mean it now but what about tomorrow when you think about all the reasons you left in the first place or next month when jasper takes a snap at me
3887548 all in favor of turning me into a vampire so ill shut the fuck up
3887549 hold on a second i think im having an epiphany here
3887550 how could jacob be so meeeeen to me i mean i just tore his heart up into itty bitty pieces hes gonna rat out my deathcycle for that
3887551 ten cameras and none of them captured the real story
3887552 most of the world wants it as gold and thats how we do it
3887553 how to make a living without a job winning ways for creating work that you love
3887554 why cant you just date the werewolf next door hes practically family
3887555 the characters are ghastly people who ruin each others lives i dont know how heathcliff and cathy ended up being ranked with couples like romeo and juliet or elizabeth bennet and mr darcy it isnt a love story its a hate story
3887556 well i hope youre smart enough to stay away from someone so selfish catherine is really the source of all the trouble not heathcliff
3887557 and speaking of italy and sports cars that i stole there you still owe me a yellow porsche
3887558 but im eighteen and im getting old i wanna die and be a vampire now
3887559 you know jacob youre awfully self righteous considering that youre a werewolf and all
3887560 so you want me to tell you the back story about sam the head werewolf
3887561 did you seriously just stamp your foot i thought girls only did that on tv
3887562 how dare you speak to boys other than meeeee he doesnt even sparkle bella
3887563 also my vampire not brother bought me that porsche so id keep you locked up while hes gone did i say while i meant
3887564 oh bella it was the great depression and i was rich and beautiful and perfect the only thing i didnt have was a baby because the only thing more important than being married young is having babies are you taking notes on this
3887565 and then i started to blame my incredible beauty for my fatal gang rape if only id had a baby like my unpretty friend
3887566 youre too young to make decisions that will affect the rest of your life bella after all you might want
3887567 im not that girl edward the one who gets married right out of high school like some small town hick who got knocked up by her boyfriend
3887568 oh darn i telepathically sense that someone cant come to the party and the milk in your fridge is going bad right now
3887569 it was childish but i liked the idea that his lips would be the last good thing i would feel even more embarrassingly something i would never say aloud i wanted his venom to poison my system
3887570 oh man did i fall asleep im sorry how long was i out
3887571 bella i love you and i want you to pick me instead of him i know you dont feel that way but i need the truth out there so that you know your options i wouldnt want a miscommunication to stand in our way
3887572 ill kiss her if i want even if she doesnt want me to and you cant stop me
3887573 listen alice dont you see its the same the one who broke in and stole my things and the new vampires in seattle theyre together
3887574 no matter what side im on if someone kisses you without your permission you should be able to make your feelings clear without hurting yourself you didnt keep your thumb inside your fist did you
3887575 hey bella i psychically sense that youre thinking about doing something incredibly stupid no i know that doesnt narrow it down much
3887576 hey alice says she psychically senses youre thinking about doing something incredibly stupid no something
3887577 hey also theres a chick werewolf who keeps stirring up telepathic werewolf paternity drama its better than passions i swear
3887578 stop taking my reluctance to potentially crush you in the missionary position as a personal rejection of your physical attractiveness bella everyone in town wants to get into your pants trust me i read their minds you dont even want to know whats going on inside mike newtons
3887579 well even if she does get her way we can keep it small just us emmett can get a clerical license off the internet
3887580 nothing much just tried to get my boyfriend to fuck me but ended up engaged instead
3887581 but i dont count that as a kiss jacob i think of it more as an assault
3887582 woman defined as belonging to a man and who then cant have any other friends
3887583 i wont let you claim all the blame here bella or all the glory either i know how to redeem myself
3887584 i used to think of you that way you know like the sun my personal sun you balanced out the clouds nicely for me
3887585 the clouds i can handle but i cant fight with an eclipse
3887586 why did you decide now to give alice free reign
3887587 oh shit i love both of them you know because we had sparkly vampire love book and furry werewolf love book what am i going to do
3887588 oh shit i love someone else but in addition to loving edward and a good bit less
3887589 the worst part is that i saw the whole thing our whole life and i want it bad jake i want it all i want to stay right here and never move i want to love you and make you happy and i cant and its killing me its like sam and emily jake i never had a choice i always knew nothing would change maybe thats why i was fighting against you so hard
3887590 you know im happy for you and i am also a complete person without a baby myself
3887591 hey baby i psychically know that were meant to be what took you so long
3887592 that kind of love and devotion is hard to resist
3887593 you missed the party princess theme she made me wear a crown and then emily suggested they all try out her new play makeup on me
3887594 if its a child she wants she can have it she can have half a dozen babies anything she wants
3887595 why didnt i just walk away oh right because im an idiot
3887596 its so good having you here it feels nice to smile i dont know how much more drama i can stand
3887597 the two things at the very top of my things i never want to do list
3887598 hey you guys it was real but i cant be having with this so yall have fun peace
3887599 shut up jacob oops im sorry i meant shut up most high alpha
3887600 the fetus isnt compatible with her body too strong for one thing but she could probably endure that for a while the bigger problem is that it wont allow her to get the sustenance she needs her body is rejecting every form of nutrition im trying to feed her intravenously but shes just not absorbing it everything about her condition is accelerated im watching her and not just her but the fetus as well starve to death by the hour i cant stop it and i cant slow it down i cant figure out what it wants
3887601 think about it carlisle if that creature is more vampire than human cant you guess what it craves what its not getting jacob did
3887602 anyway please leah we want you back sam wants you back
3887603 sam told me to beg he told me to literally get down on my knees if i have to he wants you home lee lee where you belong
3887604 im going to go out on a limb here and say that leah belongs wherever she wants to be
3887605 you know things are bad when you feel guilty for being rude to vampires
3887606 it feels complete when youre here jacob like all my family is together i mean i guess thats what its never had a big family before now its nice
3887607 from what little research weve been able to do it would appear the creatures use their own teeth to escape the womb
3887608 i kicked a few things around playing with ren e and esme i was thinking ruh nez may
3887609 r e n e s m e e too weird
3887610 what do i look like the wizard of oz you need a brain you need a heart go ahead take mine take everything i have
3887611 now that i can make out the childs thoughts its apparent that he or she has remarkably developed mental facilities he can understand us to an extent
3887612 yes he seems to have a vague sense of what hurts her now hes trying to avoid that as much as possible he loves her already
3887613 one of the purest sincerest kindest minds ive ever heard
3887614 rosell catch me if i trip over my feet en route to the bathroom which could happen pretty easily since i cant see them
3887615 hi its me bella swan again and people still want to kill me only this time bella wants to kill back
3887616 listen to her heart edward its stronger than even emmetts was ive never heard anything so vital shell be perfect
3887617 more so than i expected even with the time you had to prepare yourself mentally for this
3887618 ive never seen a newborn do that stop an emotion in its tracks that way you were upset but when you saw our concern you reined it in regained power over yourself i was prepared to help but you didnt need it
3887619 im not laughing at you bella im laughing because i am in shock and i am in shock because i am completely amazed
3887620 you shouldnt be able to do any of this you shouldnt be so so rational you shouldnt be able to stand here discussing this with me calmly and coolly and much more than any of that you should not have been able to break off mid hunt with the scent of human blood in the air even mature vampires have difficulty with always very careful of where we hunt so as not to put ourselves in the path of temptation bella youre behaving like youre decades rather than days old
3887621 trust me the baby is perfectly safe i know exactly what jacob is thinking
3887622 i thought i wouldnt feel this way for a long time
3887623 how can you even concentrate on that arent you unbearably thirsty
3887624 shes intelligent shockingly so and progressing at an immense pace though she doesnt speak yet she communicates quite effectively
3887625 the only parents in the world who dont need sleep and our child already sleeps through the night
3887626 oh god please send help i havent slept in three days
3887627 renesmees fragrance was perfectly balanced right on the line between the scent of the most beautiful perfume and the scent of the most delicious food
3887628 no srsly you guys there were these hikers in the woods
3887629 that name you came up with is kind of a mouthful and
3887630 yeah something freakys up with bella too but i cant tell you what just trust me on this
3887631 after a few minutes he asked real quietly if you turned into an animal too
3887632 shes your orphaned ward like bruce wayne and dick grayson
3887633 hey were you thinking of telling your mother about your weird sudden hotness and your toothy magical toddler
3887634 i never hurt grandpa or sue or billy jacobs father i love humans and wolf people like my jacob
3887635 a shield i think shes blocking me now so i cant be sure
3887636 they say you can put a vampire flat on his back
3887637 you look strong though perhaps you could withstand my gift
3887638 well she looks like a freaking supermodel thats what she looks like
3887639 rocking body pale as a sheet dark brown hair almost to her waist needs a good nights sleep any of this sounding familiar
3887640 the choice of a wolf form was purely chance it could have been a bear or a hawk or a panther when the first change was made these creatures truly have nothing to do with the children of the moon they have merely inherited this skill from their fathers its genetic they do not continue their species by infecting others the way true werewolves do
3887641 wait what just happened that that was kind of not cool
3887642 but she cant find them she cant feel us here
3887643 i can say its gonna be unlike anything else thats on fox and maybe on cable
3887644 im gonna have a good life out here in the private sector
3887645 why would i go back to telling everybody in the world how much money i make and barely surviving to have some obscure cabinet post and have some 20 year old from the white house telling me what im gonna do
3887646 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the trouble makers the undefinable people the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules and they have no respect for the status quo you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race foward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because of the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do
3887647 if youre a singer you lose your voice a baseball player loses his arm a writer gets more knowledge and if hes good the older he gets the better he writes

3887660 what one can say is that for people with chronic stable coronary disease pci can be deferred
3887661 they can continue on medication aimed at their specific risk factors hypertension lipid disorders diabetes and should be encouraged to have a good lifestyle with exercise smoking cessation and weight control
3887662 if people say my pain is so bad i cant function that is one thing
3887663 if people say i have angina but im doing ok thats another
3887664 pci adds about 10 000 without any significant gain in years of survival or quality of life
3887665 but when a doctor talks to a patient the doctor is an advocate for that patient
3887666 paying the cost out of pocket gives one a different point of view
3887667 until that category is changed the effect of this study will be modest
3887668 we have justified angioplasty for years by saying it is of great benefit to patients
3887669 this study shows no survival benefit and shows that the benefit in regard to symptom relief is temporary medical therapy should be considered for all patients with stable angina unless they have severe pain when diagnosed
3887670 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
3887671 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
3887672 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
3887673 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
3887674 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
3887675 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer
3887676 hes just a crazy little kid who loves to play and swim and throw rocks
3887677 i think phelps has been really important the drama and the results of the events he has been involved in have been extraordinary
3887678 were living with four dollar gas high food prices and families unable to afford summer vacations amercans need something to cheer for and this olympics and this us team is filling that need
3887679 its time for thecall to expand to the national stage in a historic gathering in our nations capital this saturday

3887688 the draws are bullish across the board lower refinery output and lower imports led to the draws in the products for the past week
3887689 i think concerns over the georgian situation raised by president george w bush technical buy stops and the stock draws on oil and products are combining to push crude futures higher
3887690 the backdrop is quite dismal now that the tax rebate checks have been spent the question is where the next infusion of cash into the economy is going to come from
3887691 financials are lower based on what appears to be an announcement coming about a settlement on auction rate securities which is putting more negative pressure on that sector

3887697 im disappointed with the result i thought we didnt deserve that
3887698 we always knew it was going to be difficult but i think especially in the first half we should have scored a goal you dont get many chances you have to take them and we didnt do that
3887699 we lost concentration on too many occasions and we got punished when playing against the top teams and playing in europe we have to learn the naviety and inexperience in the dressing room showed this evening
3887700 i still dont know we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg

3887708 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3887709 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3887710 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3887711 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3887712 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3887713 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3887714 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3887715 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3887716 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3887717 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3887718 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3887719 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3887720 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3887721 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3887722 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3887723 if there is dust in your home its not likely that its asbestos but its always good practice to wet mop it or clean it off with a wet material
3887724 gasse says apple played chicken with mobileme launch former apple product guru jean louis gasse pins the responsibility tail on the mobileme donkey in a long blog post in which he describes the machismo that leads to playing chicken with launches

3887726 t mobile usa will ditch the traditional deck to mirror apples app store starting this fall t mobile usa will take the extraordinary step of ditching its traditional deck on the phone and replacing it with a platform thats open to almost any developer multiple sources have told us think of
3887727 phishing e mail appears in mobileme disguise a few weeks ago a number of mobileme users in the uk were affected by a billing glitch that led to apple placing a 121 hold on their accounts which isnt something you want when youve just signed up for a free trial

3887732 he walked off and then we couldnt believe it the train kept going to the next station with the door fully open
3887733 people couldve fallen out it was mayhem with people panicking and pressing the emergency button
3887734 it was going pretty fast and people were struggling calling out to press the emergency button
3887735 they should have cancelled that train until they fixed the problem i stayed on the train until melbourne central and the door still wasnt closing properly along the way
3887736 safety is a concern and we need to find out if the driver should have proceeded
3887737 if he felt the situation could be managed he may have decided to continue on no doubt mindful the next train had been cancelled
3887738 but if he knew the door was open he shouldnt have continued on
3887739 roughly speaking considering the number of doors on the trains and the number of services we run we would be opening and closing doors a million times a day
3887740 since january our customer feedback section has been contacted about eight incidents relating to doors

3887744 its the right decision now we can all get on with it
3887745 its nothing personal but its very uncomfortable pretty insensitive and inappropriate that hes there
3887746 its going to be a pretty important event in our lives in the short term and to have three exams ups the stress
3887747 its also a matter of your hands getting tired writing pages and pages of stuff for hours
3887748 in 2007 students were blogging about questions and answers immediately after their exams
3887749 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3887750 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3887751 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

3887807 ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra
3887808 si rusia est violando el alto el fuego y tengo informes que no son muy alentadores al respecto entonces esto servir para profundizar el aislamiento internacional en el que rusia se est moviendo
3887809 lo mejor ahora es dejar en manos de los franceses los esfuerzos de mediaci n
3887810 ha dejado muy claro que apoya al gobierno democr ticamente elegido de georgia
3887811 esto podr a haber sido resuelto dentro de unos l mites
3887812 pero lo que ha hecho rusia va m s all de todo eso y al prolongar el conflicto las reas inocentes en georgia est n en peligro
3887813 que rusia puede usar su impresionante poder militar en la regi n contra un peque o pa s vecino es obvio que rusia puede hacer eso sin consecuencias o que lo lleven hasta tal punto de destruir al estado georgiano eso creo que es algo diferente rusia no puede tener xito en eso

3887843 deploying femtocells requires a good understanding of market segmentation of both mobile consumer and household markets meticulous planning and targeted marketing campaigns which mean operators will have to invest substantial amount of money if they want femtocell services to gain popularity
3887844 if femtocells are sold to customers in sporadic fashion via traditional mobile operators channels then this may induce a huge scattering of femtocell deployment over large areas not only will this make it hard to manage faps femtocell access points and related networks but most importantly this would mean the operator will not be able to make any capex capital expenditure or opex operational expenditure savings

3887849 the presidency thinks right now its better to focus on problem solving rather than trying to go into characterisation of the war who started what who reacted and the eu is united behind the idea
3887850 the presidency wants to preserve as much room for manoeuvre for future mediation as possible
3887851 the situation is still evolving its not black and white of course georgia made some mistakes russia made some mistakes but the idea now is to help mediation to see what we can do from a humanitarian point of view
3887852 the eu should say no to russias subjugation of georgia and push russia out this means tough language sanctions against russia and quick eu humanitarian intervention
3887853 the first lesson of this crisis is that the old policy of eu non engagement has encouraged both parties to escalate their actions from an eu perspective the first casualty is the theory that by getting more involved in georgia the eu will irritate russia and provoke instability
3887854 if and when it changes we will have a wholesale business and our association with tata will give us great experience in india
3887855 we view this as a sensible deal for tesco with a strong partner in tata which has existing retail capability and strong local knowledge of the indian market whilst it will enable tesco to begin the development infrastructure and supply chain which is one of the current constraints of the indian market to modern retail practices

3887894 a verse like love thine enemy had a great influence on me
3887895 at this stage i was still a muslim and i thought that i would remain one but every day i saw the terrible things done in the name of religion by those who considered themselves great believers
3887896 i studied islam more thoroughly and found no answers there i re examined the koran and the principals of the faith and found how it is mistaken and misleading

3888067 the irony in that conclusion is that the u s equity market might be relatively attractive when compared to many other markets even though the conventional wisdom is that the credit crisis is a u s problem
3888068 but when it comes to emerging markets that have less exposure to financials you need to remember there may be other structural problems in some of these markets that dont have big financial exposure i agree though that the u s is becoming a more attractive place to invest
3888069 history shows that the u s tends to lead the world into a slowdown and recessions but it does so with lags

3888081 well be training students to frame the correct questions by giving them a background in all the right disciplines and then training them to weave those disciplines together so they can apply the strengths of each to large population based and patient based studies
3888082 bringing in dollars to educate students is also beneficial to the state
3888083 we want our food choices to nourish and sustain our bodies but increasingly consumers are looking for foods produced in ways that are also good for the earth consequently farmers producers and food manufacturers want to communicate these eco friendlier growing practices so that consumers can decide which products are aligned with their environmental philosophies and whether these products higher prices are worth it organic is the benchmark of eco labels with the federal government backing its definitions standards and verification process since 2002 but it is by far not alone eco label terms seals or logos grass fed free range bird friendly and beyond are showing up more frequently in all food categories

3888141 sir i need to ask you to go back inside
3888142 it was a very physical game with twente man marking us all over the pitch with a lot of spirit and belief
3888143 but in the second half they could not keep pace and we were able to take over
3888144 we played with a very young team and did not lose our nerve then our technical superiority allowed us to score to goals
3888145 we approached the game well if you see how we conceded goals arsenal scored because our organisation at the free kick was not okay and not by playing good football
3888146 we made a good start and against top teams you wont get many chances so you have to score when you can
3888147 our inexperience in europe showed in key moments and that cost us the game
3888148 there is complete agreement between the club and the player david jimenez silva that he will remain with us for the next five seasons
3888149 we have always expressed the hope that he will stay with us
3888150 somebodys got to be north americas team right it might as well be us
3888151 im looking forward to getting toronto people to believe in the bills and make it like a home away from home
3888152 im not against the nfl or the buffalo bills its just keeping the cfl alive and the nfl in the united states
3888153 im all for it if it helps bring the fan base to the bills
3888154 its a small market team and id say we need all the help we can get
3888155 thats what im afraid of i definitely dont want us losing them to toronto
3888156 i dont think the commissioners going to come in and tell the team the same thing that hes telling the people if it werent true
3888157 i believe what he says and i plan on finishing my career as a buffalo bill in buffalo
3888158 they have not spoon fed me they have given me it all
3888159 i wish the game was saturday instead of thursday to be honest with you but theres nothing i can do about that but it will feel real good to get out there again

3888169 would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body
3888170 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3888171 i went to church and hung out with my friends and realized that playing in a band sending out a bad message isnt really what i should be doing i hated the fact that 13 year old girls were singing things like the arch in your eyebrows tell the truth just imagine what your back can do and thinking it was normal
3888172 i hated what the record was turning into we wrote these killer songs and then all of the sudden it seemed like everybody else only cared about what will make them money i dont mean that in a slanderous way thats just what it boils down to john feldmann the producer is a 40 something year old man writing goldfinger songs called handjobs for jesus need i say more i recorded all of my parts and got out of there everything was just so fake and business related i just wanted to go home and make music with people i love

3888179 hasta ahora de lo que he podido leer de las mismas no he visto ninguna norma que colinde con la constituci n ninguna que sea contraria a alguna disposici n constitucional creo que esas afirmaciones son un poco ligeras de se alar que estas leyes van en contra de la carta magna
3888180 en todo caso tendr a que terminar de leer las otras leyes para ver que se alan lo mismo

3888183 i looked at it as with a young team and my experience in providence maybe that could be a strength for me
3888184 explores the lighter side of sports and pulls inspiration from the entertainment spectacles that are so prevalent in pop culture today
3888185 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someone s got to do something about this
3888186 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3888187 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kind of hokey but it s the truth
3888188 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on people s thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3888189 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3888190 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i don t think there s any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3888191 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3888192 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything i ve been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3888193 there were a few things that would ve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3888194 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it s a chain reaction
3888195 its way too early to know which if any of these technologies is going to be practical

3888197 in situations where it is important to win the hearts and minds of the local populace it would be useful to know if they understand the information being given them
3888198 its also important to develop antidotes and protective agents against various classes of drugs
3888199 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
3888200 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
3888201 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
3888202 if we can alter the brain why not control it one potential use involves making soldiers want to fight
3888203 you could mine this stuff with teaspoons and still make money
3888204 from the point of view of the world we will be desperately short of this stuff if cigar lake doesn t come on stream
3888205 cigar lake is a very valuable deposit and there s no thought of abandoning it
3888206 i think if cigar lake were to be delayed what cameco lost on sales volumes it would more than make up on higher prices
3888207 an inflow at this rate is disappointing but our remediation plan as approved by our joint venture partners recognized the risk and included specific actions to be taken at various levels of inflow
3888208 it freezes all the water and as a result s a barrier
3888209 there s no doubt that refiners are making less gasoline
3888210 the demand is bad so why store a product that you re going to have trouble selling
3888211 we ve got a good sized rally but it still doesn t feel like it s sustainable we re not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3888212 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3888213 i don t think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3888214 higher pump prices and a slowing economy were undoubtedly factors

3888220 the police party was deployed in front of the police station and a suicide bomber approached them on foot and exploded himself resulting in seven deaths so far
3888221 it was an act to sabotage the independence day celebrations
3888222 i saw at least three policemen lying on the ground unconscious or dead
3888223 there were three to four other policemen standing nearby with their uniforms torn

3888228 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3888229 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3888230 weve had discussions with multiple companies in russia and hopefully well see some light at the end of the tunnel here by the end of the year
3888231 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3888232 at this stage theres no formal discussions going on but there was an inquiry
3888233 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3888234 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3888235 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3888236 theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3888237 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3888238 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3888239 on our side as a party we have no problems on that aspect
3888240 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3888241 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3888242 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3888243 witnessed terrifying scenes of destruction in four villages that used to be populated exclusively by ethnic georgians
3888244 we still have diplomatic relations with georgia we have millions of georgian nationals who are russian citizens and living happily in russia
3888245 but we wont directly talk to saakashvili we wont do that we offered him peace but not friendship
3888246 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3888247 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3888248 i think phelps has been really important the drama and the results of the events he has been involved in have been extraordinary
3888249 were living with four dollar gas high food prices and families unable to afford summer vacations amercans need something to cheer for and this olympics and this us team is filling that need

3888281 seventy percent of the oil we use comes from foreign countries
3888282 the biggest roadblock for us on wind is we need congress to get avenues out of wind corridor to transmit to the east and west coasts
3888283 whoever wins the presidency be it obama or mccain theyll see this is the only plan that anybody has to reduce foreign oil quickly
3888284 i think wind as strong as that wind was in oklahoma how could it not work
3888285 i think hes got the most sensible plan ive heard i want to help support it

3888296 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3888297 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3888298 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3888299 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3888300 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3888301 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3888302 it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission
3888303 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3888304 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3888305 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3888306 on the one hand this could be a way to set up a buffer zone between the separatist regions and on the other it also seems there is an aspect of disbanding the georgian military aspects
3888307 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3888308 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3888309 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3888310 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

3888328 i spent six weeks in vienna dealing with the austrian police who treated me not as a mother in shock and disbelief but as a vile creature who had the audacity to ask them to help me find my gay son
3888329 according to the police since my son was gay it was obvious that he was emotionally unstable and thus must have committed suicide
3888330 that he probably killed himself because he was hiv positive or had aids
3888331 austrian law enforcement was not required to take missing persons reports on non citizens

3888359 the response has not been adequate it looks like appeasement to me we need real action not just words
3888360 first say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do
3888361 we have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable
3888362 anything is possible but you have to believe and you have to fight
3888363 the fear of suffering is often worse than the suffering itself
3888364 its only pain and its only suffering its not going to kill you and if its not going to kill you whats the big deal
3888365 i never saw a wild thing sorry for itself a small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself
3888366 it is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
3888367 the strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack
3888368 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat
3888369 somebody may beat me but they are going to have to bleed to do it
3888370 the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
3888371 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not
3888372 as a man sows he shall reap and i know that talk is cheap so the hotter the battle is the sweeter the victory
3888373 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be
3888374 heights by great men reached and kept were not obtained by sudden flight but while their companions slept they were toiling upward in the night
3888375 its not the size of the dog in the fight its the size of the fight in the dog

3888380 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it

3888412 there are no safe jobs as far as the wideouts go people are getting replaced people are fighting for spots when you get on the field you want everyone to be good but you want to be great
3888413 in order for us to be a better wide receiver group we need this competition
3888414 the freshmen are all athletic kids and they are all fast it makes you work harder in order to be a great team it has to be this way
3888415 i got an opportunity and im trying to take it
3888416 i have to run proper routes and not make rookie mistakes im a senior and this is my last go around

3888419 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3888420 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

3888425 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3888426 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3888427 in this case it was determined that we need to move forward in a timely fashion
3888428 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama

3888431 i think you might be missing the part about spending eight hours a day swimming thats a big part of the plan

3888433 theres still a broad circulation there and even though the chance of it becoming a depression has been reduced in the short term long term we should still be paying attention to it

3888435 mr lehmann had been brutally bashed probably with a blunt object
3888436 investigators have been following several lines of inquiry over the past six months but at this time they have all been exhausted
3888437 we are aware that he had planned an imminent trip overseas to visit a critically ill relative in the days prior to his death mr lehamnns relatives in germany are desperate for answers about his death
3888438 with the 75 000 congressman dents received from big oil youd sure think he could afford to pay for a mailing out of his campaign funds instead hes leaving lehigh valley taxpayers footing the bill
3888439 everyday our country is falling further into debt and more of our taxpayer dollars are being spent in iraq not here at home but dent sees fit to spend taxpayer money on his campaign direct mail instead of on policies that will move this country in the right direction maybe this is dents plan for public campaign financing
3888440 it is an outrage that a convicted felon who took bribes and was convicted of public corruption is now going to receive a taxpayer subsidized city pension
3888441 chicken charlie the dented will likely be back as a character until dent starts debating bennett
3888442 congressman dent is so deep in the pocket of big oil companies and special interest groups hes refusing to publicly defend his record and have an open debate about the issue
3888443 he should explain why hes taken 75 000 from big oil and given them billions in tax breaks while middle class pennsylvanians are struggling to afford high gas prices voters deserve an open dialogue on the issues and congressman dent is ducking the issue
3888444 she issues a challenge to debate during the week of august 11th a non partisan group the parkland school district alumni association holds a forum that attracts fifty people from the community and siobhan bennett is nowhere to be seen
3888445 this is what she said she wanted a chance to debate her energy plan with me i rearranged my schedule so that i could attend but bennett was a no show maybe shes more interested in issuing challenges and sending letters than in actually doing the debates
3888446 i think to a certain degree she must see that even sen obama her partys presidential candidate has had to do a 180 degree turn on allowing for greater american energy production sam is stuck way out there in an extreme irrational position that the majority of the people in this district dont support a position in fact the majority of the american people dont agree with that has to be awkward for her and her campaign to deal with
3888447 standard operating procedure for the bennett campaign is to make outrageous statements and then to get called on her facts she went on a radio program recently and called charlie a chicken for not debating her then the very week she says she wants to schedule a debate on an important issue she fails to show up at a debate it looks like the bennett campaign laid another egg
3888448 well very nice you know very cheering for us to hear that but ok its time to pass from this from words to deeds
3888449 we are not looking to nor do we need to take control of any air or seaports to conduct this mission
3888450 the role of the u s military is strictly to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of this conflict

3888486 princess cruises has long stood for romance and reconnection and so were delighted to have trista and ryan christen ruby princess as they celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary

3888512 liberals like nancy pelosi and charlie brown want to continue supporting federal laws that prevents us from tapping americas vast oil resources thats how we got into this mess and why gasoline prices are now breaking our family budgets
3888513 america has nearly a trillion barrels of recoverable oil more than three times that of saudi arabia that democrats like nancy pelosi and charlie brown wont even let us touch in fact more than 94 percent of our territory remains off limits because of this foolish prohibition if we want to change this policy weve got to change this congress
3888514 meanwhile the vast oil fields off the coast of florida that american law prevents americans from developing are now being drained by the chinese government drilling in cuban waters
3888515 and still nancy pelosi and her supporters in congress continue to block the development of these vast american oil reserves

3888529 republicans are coming together in support of senator obama to bring change to washington
3888530 george w bush is not qualified to be president and we should be really worried about this
3888531 i supported bush in 2000 but george w bush is not listening to his honest conservative policy advisers and we should be really worried about this
3888532 i supported bush in 2000 and 2001 but 911 has unhinged the administration its detention and other policies are counterproductive it needs to be opposed
3888533 i supported bush over 2000 2002 but enough is enough thats it i supported the invasion of iraq because i was certain there was evidence of an advanced nuclear weapons program otherwise invading iraq was just stupid well there was no advanced nuclear weapons program invading iraq was just stupid plus theres the medicare drug benefit these people need to be evicted from power

3888706 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3888707 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3888708 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize

3888712 when you violate your partners trust your send your relationship account into deficit intimacy is replaced by painful emotional and physical distance as the offender you feel that inspite of your apology and repentance your wounded partner is still exacting their pound of flesh and making you pay but they are not they are simply out of surplus emotional resources their tank is empty its taking all they have just to keep it together expecting them to be their old self is like asking a legless man to hurry up and walk its not going to happen what can you do to help the same thing you do when you have a deficit in your bank account stop making withdrawals dont ask or expect from your partner all they normally do for you dont wait to be served pick up your dirty dishes iron your own clothes surrender your sense of entitlement practice the christ like art of denying yourself for now lean on god and your christian friends and family to help meet your temporarily unmet needs start making deposits make them small and often if you give you will get your gift will return to you pressed down shaken together running over luke 6 38 tlb consistent deposits can eventually cancel the deficit moving the relationship into surplus quietly finds ways to make your partners life easier small courtesies thoughtful deeds little considerations that serve and salve these are the things that invite your partner to feel its safe to push defrost start taking small risks reconnect and test the waters again
3888713 the first step that our team is going to have to understand from day one is you have to have the belief that youre going to win the stanley cup
3888714 to do that you have to believe that you can win every game i cant wait to get started
3888715 thats what its been about the past five years in providence you want to get them to develop create an environment that they can be successful as individuals and as a team and along the way win some games its a lot harder to develop in a losing atmosphere you have to learn how to win
3888716 when you looked at our roster last year we didnt have a team that anybody would have picked to win the amount of games that we did
3888717 for me the most important thing is the players wanting to play for each other
3888718 its about getting them to believe in each other you can be the nicest guy in the world but if you dont have any structure your team is probably going to fail i think its important as a coach that you establish relationships with your leaders so that they help you get your message across
3888719 i had several ingredients i was looking for in a coach
3888720 communication skills the ability to provide structure the sense of accountability most importantly i was looking for a coach with a lot of integrity and honesty as an organization were extremely proud and happy to have scott as our head coach his track record speaks for itself
3888721 i worry about the present season and i worry about the task at hand
3888722 i never looked beyond that in my third year pro i was down in the east coast hockey league and i thought i wasnt going to make it to the nhl when i got to johnstown i couldnt believe the situation i was in i said to myself im just going to go out and have fun and enjoy every day and not worry about the future almost a year and a month to that day i made my nhl debut
3888723 its one of the most deserving things ive ever seen
3888724 i was talking to some of the guys and we heard he was one of the three final candidates everyone was pulling for him he proved year in and year out that he was one of the best coaches in the ahl he brings out the best in everybody

3888726 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3888727 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3888728 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3888729 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3888730 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas

3888841 we get the water from eight in the morning to one in the afternoon but the problem is that the water comes directly from the well to our house untreated and is really unsafe to drink
3888842 there are times when the pump at the well breaks down and we have to revert to donkey water which is less hygienic than tap water
3888843 my family of eight used to rely on water fetched in 20 litre jerrycans on the heads of my wife and our daughters but we started using donkey water since we live so far from the well our worst problem is not the purity of the water but the very high cost because of the rising fuel prices

3888905 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3888906 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3888907 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3888910 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3888911 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3888912 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3888913 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3888914 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3888915 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3888916 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3888917 i knew it was going to be a tough match
3888918 i made a lot of mistakes in the first set
3888919 when the second set began i decided i had to change up i started hitting a lot of heavy balls and lobs and i saw she didnt know what to do with those sometimes you have to win ugly
3888920 once i got my serve going and my feet moving i was able to move the ball around on her and make her play
3888921 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3888922 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3889182 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3889183 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3889184 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3889185 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3889186 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

3889206 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close its not just diablo iii weve got plans beyond
3889207 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
3889208 i havent made any drastic changes i feel just as comfortable as before

3889219 nos preguntamos que pasa con las salidas terrestres que tenemos en misiones porque las detenciones en casos de probables supresiones de identidad como pas hace unos d as el control se hace reci n en paso de los libres pasa lo mismo con la trata de adolescentes falta control de autoridades policiales en la garita sin ir mas lejos solo mueven la mano para que pases
3889220 porque en misiones creo que aqu los bebes son muy lindos y hay terreno f rtil en cuanto a la pobreza y marginalidad esto tiene que ver con una costumbre por desgracia se sigue promocionando ober como un lugar f rtil para encontrar beb s y solo sirvi para levantar los precios en cuanto a tramites de adopci n porque los riesgos son mayores el negocio subi de costo
3889221 no se act a con controles y la justicia tiene legislaci n acotada si sabes de un caso no podes hacer nada porque la ley no te permite a excepci n de ser un familiar directo
3889222 la adopci n legal no es negocio sino la supresi n de identidad la intermediaci n y el detectar embarazadas hay muchas chicas que tambi n aprovechan la situaci n cada a o hacen un negocio sin trabajar eso tambi n es una realidad
3889223 la legislaci n hay que cambiarla estamos charlando con el ministro de derechos humanos edmundo soria vieta y otros sectores ver que se puede hacer porque aunque se cambie la legislaci n la delincuencia tambi n afina la punter a perfeccionar la libreta materno infantil tratar de incluir a todo el n cleo familiar en ella y materializar un tribunal penal de ni os ni as y adolescentes para que haya un seguimiento de los casos porque se detectan pero no se llega a nada no hay condenados no hay especificaciones suficientes
3889224 de nada sirve legislar si no hay responsabilidad com n
3889225 a la gente de misiones le cuesta mucho adoptar aqu y sin embargo personas de otras provincias tienen prioridad no estamos en contra pero una vez que este chico se va pierde contacto con su identidad biol gica
3889226 se dice se respeta la voluntad de la madre pero hay muchos vicios que analizar igualmente su animo o situaci n econ mica los jueces de ober no se desentienden del tema pero les falta herramientas como este registro de adoptantes o equipo interdisciplinario para que el juez detecte si la voluntad de la madre es tal hoy no cuentan con eso

3889228 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3889229 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3889230 vinieron unas cinco mil personas y este a o vienen gente de buenos aires la plata de todos lados

3889232 el santo se paga la fiesta es decir si alguien viene le pide algo al santo y ste le cumple entonces la persona al a o siguiente trae dinero o colabora con cajas de pollo o chorizo como mucha gente lo hizo este a o incluso los costillares para el asado vienen de la pampa
3889233 lo que pasa es que hay gente que no sabe bien la historia de l y confunde mucho y por ah hay quienes hablan sin saber
3889234 no hay ofrendas especiales para el santo la m s grande que se le puede hacer al santo es darle un vaso de agua a un enfermo terminal o no negarle agua o comida a tu pr jimo que golpea a la puerta lo de llevarle whisky es moderno pero antes los abor genes le invitaban ca a al monjecito porque el les llevaba la comida tambi n les llevan golosinas
3889235 no es verdad porque si uno es amigo y le falla lo nico que el santo hace es alejarse y hacer sentir que est lejos de uno
3889236 when you marry you must not expect the honeymoon to last forever sooner or later you will meet the stresses and strains of everyday life you must not expect your husband to be constantly at your side
3889237 i declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong but i shall not have the strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in with me as i now invite you to do i know that your support will be unfailingly given god help me to make good my vow and god bless all of you who are willing to share in it
3889238 the one lesson that the abdication of edward viii burnt deep into the souls of the present queen and queen mother was that you never never abdicate your duty the queen has always seen that with privilege goes responsibility
3889239 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3889240 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3889241 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3889242 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3889243 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3889244 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3889245 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3889246 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3889247 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3889248 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3889249 i tried to find as many as possible off leash hikes
3889250 moving back to the boston area having lived out west where a dog can basically roam anywhere it was really important to find places to let my dog really run
3889251 water is very important for swimming and drinking and shade dogs overheat much faster than humans do
3889252 also i looked for nothing too rocky and you dont want broken glass
3889253 having grown up in the area i had some favorite spots from my childhood
3889254 and there are a lot of places i found out about in the course of researching the book
3889255 its a very small park 80 acres but it has nice views of the surrounding communities and for dogs in wellesley it is also an off leash opportunity
3889256 one that surprised me the most which i wasnt even going to go to but was persuaded to go to was callahan state park in framingham
3889257 the trustees of reservations has a lot of wonderful property along the charles
3889258 now that its clean it is a wonderful place to bring a dog for a swim
3889259 the berkshires are amazing for folks that like to hike further
3889260 mount watatic which is kind of in north central mass was another one that really surprised me it has beautiful sweeping views
3889261 you probably dont think about getting your dog in shape but just like people have different levels of activeness dogs have the same thing
3889262 i dont think they appreciate being weekend warriors as much as people do
3889263 hiking with dogs has become a controversial thing its a complex thing the interaction of hikers with dogs and hikers without dogs
3889264 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3889265 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3889266 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3889267 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3889268 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3889269 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3889270 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3889271 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3889272 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3889273 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3889274 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3889275 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3889276 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3889277 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3889278 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3889279 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3889280 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3889281 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3889282 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3889283 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3889284 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3889285 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3889286 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3889287 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3889288 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3889289 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3889290 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3889291 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3889292 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3889293 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3889294 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3889295 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3889296 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3889297 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3889298 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3889299 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3889300 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3889301 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3889302 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3889303 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3889304 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3889305 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3889306 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3889307 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3889308 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3889313 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3889314 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3889315 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3889316 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3889317 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3889410 she challenged me in a manner halfway between serious questioning and lighthearted flirting as in do you think the likes of you can handle a big role like that but eventually she looked long and hard at me and said ok next season
3889411 there are times where happy hour doesnt stay happy and things spin out of control

3889444 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3889445 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3889446 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3889447 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3889448 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3889449 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3889450 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe

3889462 this is a very good deal for marifil and i believe speaks volumes as to the potential size and profitability of this large deposit we have analyzed four wells and since these wells were sited to test deeper oil targets they are essentially random with respect to testing the shallower potash deposit this probably means that we have not seen the axis of the potash basin where the thicker and richer parts of the deposit occur
3889463 as we have seen with other sporting events that run during traditional working hours for example the ncaa basketball tournament fans are making time at the office for the olympics
3889464 while the olympics were until very recently a packaged prime time tv event they now represent a 24 7 opportunity for both fans and the media the available inventory online provides a really interesting platform for the olympics long tail events and sports previously represented perhaps only in the results section of the morning paper can now be viewed by fans around the world well know soon enough if the online audience maintains interest for the duration of the games

3889471 it was a very physical game with twente man marking us all over the pitch with a lot of spirit and belief
3889472 but in the second half they could not keep pace and we were able to take over
3889473 we played with a very young team and did not lose our nerve then our technical superiority allowed us to score to goals
3889474 we approached the game well if you see how we conceded goals arsenal scored because our organisation at the free kick was not okay and not by playing good football
3889475 we made a good start and against top teams you wont get many chances so you have to score when you can
3889476 our inexperience in europe showed in key moments and that cost us the game
3889477 marc no one seems to know the answer to this one so sync is my last hope

3889488 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3889490 the best elements of the original are back but have been upgraded to be better than before the new bosses add a more interesting challenge and the final level is one for the ages and of course the visuals are brilliant the remastered soundtrack is fantastic as well from top to bottom bionic commando rearmed is an incredible game thats well worth owning
3889491 between the multiplayer modes and the challenge rooms theres more than enough innovation to make up for the minor irritations of the retro controls far from perfect bionic commando rearmed is still a much more complete and robust package than either 1942 joint strike or commando 3 and another impressive addition to capcoms download library
3889492 rearmed quickly wears out its welcome and devolves into a series of frustrations precision platforming is required for almost everything and failure often leads to death the latter half of the game is especially unforgiving although ironically the end level bosses arent nearly as bad as the path you took to get to them we recommend bringing a friend along in the excellent new co op mode
3889493 despite being on xbox live bionic commando rearmeds cooperative and multiplayer modes are both offline only

3889506 tutti possono farti regali tutti tranne me come lo spieghi

3889526 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3889527 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3889528 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3889529 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3889530 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3889531 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3889532 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3889533 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3889534 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3889535 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3889536 there are parts of it where it very much looks like jaliek and other parts where perhaps its not
3889537 i would expect the police to continue looking for my child and not to presume that he was dead
3889538 weve been tracking down every possible lead again weve asked for cooperation from steven and jocelyn we havent had that theyve lawyered up which is there prerogative but were doing everything within our power to find jaliek one way or the other
3889539 in my opinion no all of a sudden after nine and a half months he just shows up in colonie center i really find that hard to believe
3889540 im not surprised that chief bell is so convinced that this is not jaliek because it fits into what he believes which is that of course jaliek is not alive
3889541 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3889542 my sister another sister then another brother i have a family i never knew anything about
3889543 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3889544 it feels really good sometimes we come together really well
3889545 its nice to have a really good game the good thing about c division is all the teams get along there is a lot of camaraderie out here so it is good to win but its not overly competitive
3889546 we have come together pretty well as a team outside of the field we are all friends which works well together i think the fact that we can all get along and we are all pretty excited about playing so it works well
3889547 we want to win but over that we just want to have fun we want to go out there and have a good time
3889548 it wasnt exactly a blowout the score didnt indicate the game in that respect
3889549 its pretty hard to get 10 runs back in one inning
3889550 we get some of our key players back which should make a difference
3889551 i would like to remind you that they re on the clock
3889552 broad deep and global and it is not likely to end soon
3889553 im vacationing in my backyard i wont be checking email until monday thanks for your patience
3889554 no amount of money will make up for the loss
3889555 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3889556 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3889557 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
3889558 i love the olive garden so much because i grew up going there
3889559 that used to be the place we would go for mothers day for birthdays my grandpa just died and right after his funeral we went to the olive garden

3889562 from relaxing on lobbyist paid vacations to shielding jailed lobbyist jack abramoff from public accountability roger wicker seems to be busy in washington taking care of everyone except the people who elected him
3889563 getting free massages at fancy resorts when youre supposed to be on a fact finding mission does not pass the smell test for most mississippians mississippians deserve to know the truth about roger wicker and his special interest loyalties and the more they learn about his record the more theyll want wicker out of office
3889564 theres lots of available office space in the 1st congressional district and we have very much enjoyed having our office there
3889565 we chose that space because the office is literally at the busiest intersection in the state right near the mall were in the district and in boise
3889566 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3889567 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3889568 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3889569 it was very difficult to play against that team my goal didnt take the sting out it was the team goal we want to qualify we are a big club we should be in a big competition like the champions league we did enough to win 2 0 the first was not my best goal ever but it was still important
3889570 the team may be young but if they are playing for arsenal then they must be very good they have the quality and i am happy for them
3889571 we expected a physical game and we were not disappointed they man marked us well we had to be patient and two goals came after the first goal we looked a lot more comfortable
3889572 we were young in the middle of the park so people might be worried but i had confidence in them i am expecting two players back for the west brom game this weekend
3889573 the result is not super but we have given ourselves a good starting position
3889574 znacznie wykroczy y poza to co by o potrzebne dla ochrony swoich si pokojowych
3889575 this result is important but we have to be concentrated when we go to bratislava as this team beat celtic 5 0 in 2005 we need to remember that
3889576 i think each half is a game in itself so really this tie is four matches and we are only midway through the result has to be earned in slovakia
3889577 it was crucial to score goals on our return to the champions league and the lads played a great game
3889578 he was unable to do the pre season training he wanted last year and suffered because of that situation

3889581 this is very progressive and the government is trying to raise the number of women in parliament but i think the biggest challenge will be whether the quantity can be matched with quality
3889582 when you bring in this many new candidates onto a list you are going to get people who are very new to the process and who may lack experience
3889583 during many years of war the soldiers were in control everything was militarised and men were very much in control
3889584 for a long time men did the work while women stayed at home and did the domestic work very little importance was given to women and during the war women had little chance of education
3889585 but also during this time women started to think about things they could do to stop the war and they started to talk about peace
3889586 mothers saw their sons taking part in the war and saw some not coming home and those that did were traumatised and mutilated and this moved women to do things to bring about peace
3889587 women are participating more because they know they need to fight for the keeping of peace angola has as lot of women living here more women than men and women are very much involved in the communication in communities and the point of view held by people
3889588 i think men are ready to start listening to women i think this country is prepared for the participation of women
3889589 the war was a very sad memory and no one wants a repetition of that angola and society doesnt want to repeat the war
3889590 this is fundamental a lot of children are not getting an education because of a lack of schools and a lack of money this is a very big preoccupation for mothers
3889591 often you have children finishing high school and they have no chance of entering university and they cant get jobs and when they cant get jobs they become a huge burden to their families because without education and a job they cant do anything
3889592 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3889593 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3889594 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3889595 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3889596 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3889597 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3889598 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3889599 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3889618 she has also made major contributions to the wider university serving on many committees including the university council convening review panels for other departments and chairing the board of university college since 2000
3889619 by coincidence professor white came from the same department as professor hayne on the completion of his term as deputy vice chancellor he will be returning to his own research and academic work later in the year the university will want to pay tribute to the huge contribution he has made

3889621 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3889622 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3889623 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3889624 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3889625 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3889626 these stimulus payments can give them and our economy much needed help

3889631 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3889632 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way

3889639 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl

3889644 if an accord does not happen the government could take the initiative to build the two works through eletrobras
3889645 the brazilian government really wants to get these projects done because of concerns about potential power shortages
3889646 my sense of this is that both companies will defend their interests and you might have legal action but therell be some kind of agreement
3889647 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3889648 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is

3889654 el directorio le pidi la renuncia porque consideramos que el equipo no est rindiendo lo que deber a estar rindiendo
3889655 la diferencia estuvo en mantener a nuestro abridor en el mont culo hasta casi el final del partido que se present muy dif cil como siempre sucede con el primero de un torneo de los juegos ol mpicos
3889656 han llegado como siempre muy bien preparados con lanzadores inteligentes que pueden ir a m s a medida que avance el torneo
3889657 significa much simo para nosotros que sea la ltima olimpiada y si ganamos entraremos en la historia por lo que estamos dispuestos a dar una buena batalla
3889658 fue mi primer partido de juegos ol mpicos y aunque ten a experiencia en la copa del mundo lo conseguido ante jap n me dar confianza para el reto del torneo
3889659 la mala comunicaci n entre el primera base y el lanzador fue lo que provoc que se diese la pelota de partido y cayese del lado de nuestro rivales
3889660 nuestros lanzadores han estado bien pero no siempre en el b isbol se consigue que las cosas est n de tu lado
3889661 se construyeron los 16 portones de acceso al estadio se mejor notablemente el sistema de luces y ba os se abrieron 12 puertas hacia la cancha se pintaron las grader as y el resto del lugar se instal la grama que est perfecta y s lo falta concluir los trabajos menores
3889662 el estadio est listo el 30 de agosto y el presidente de motagua pedro atala ya dijo que el partido contra el arsenal se jugar en la capital
3889663 el encuentro estaba programado para jugarse en el nacional pero la fifa lo descart por estar siendo remodelado y no est listo por ahora
3889664 por lo tanto honduras ya no se medir all con jamaica lo har en el estadio ol mpico metropolitano de san pedro sula
3889665 la fifa ha notificado que el ol mpico metropolitano es el estadio autorizado para hacer ese juego
3889666 a pesar del gran esfuerzo para concluir con rapidez los trabajos para mejorar el nacional no podemos autorizarlo en vista que faltan algunos detalles
3889667 son buenos fuertes y organizados con buenas individualidades y dominio del bal n pero mi objetivo es jugar bien y cuando eso se hace casi siempre se gana

3889677 la federaci n espa ola nos desampar en la operaci n puerto
3889678 la verdad es que la federaci n espa ola de ciclismo nos dej un poco apartados a m y a otros corredores creo que eso no es justo porque ellos como nuestra federaci n deben apoyarnos en las buenas y en las malas
3889679 creo que en esa ocasi n nos dejaron tirados se apoy mucho a alejandro valverde y a otros corredores mientras que a otro grupo nos aislaron la verdad es que me sent desamparado
3889680 ahora la cosa est cambiando siento que ellos entienden lo que ha pasado y ojal todo se arregle
3889681 yo creo que escogieron un deporte d bil y esto le est haciendo mucho da o porque no creo en todo lo que se habla creo que ste deporte es muy lindo es un esfuerzo de cada d a y no se puede acabar por esto las cosas deben cambiar r pidamente
3889682 deben estar unidos todos tanto el ciclista los equipos la uci uni n ciclista internacional y todos los entes
3889683 creo que hay que defender al ciclista no solo acusarle de todo creo que las cosas se deben hacer de otra manera y quitar la persecuci n que hay contra nosotros
3889684 defendiendo al dopaje porque hay dopaje trampas hay en todo en la vida pero creo que no es para nada todo lo que se dice ni la idea que se quiere vender
3889685 a m por ejemplo la operaci n puerto me afect mucho f sica y moralmente te hunde gracias a dios y a la gente que me quiere uno trata de salir adelante de dejar eso atr s
3889686 eso me hizo mucho da o pero sigo disfrutando de la bicicleta de mis amigos de la gente que me vale lo otro lo dejo atr s la vida es demasiado dura entonces hay que pensar en positivo ahora tengo la cabeza muy en alto y no me arrepiento de nada

3889701 it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3889702 we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3889703 the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the russian empire

3889705 but i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
3889706 weve got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to sen obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president

3889786 government action is important but we must also consider our own behaviour for the sake of the planet we must wean ourselves off the notion that a weekend bender in prague has no consequences other than a hangover
3889787 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3889788 if you want to decrease the chances of being burglarized lock your house before you leave
3889789 drilling will only serve to put more money in the pockets of oil companies
3889790 what would happen if al gore used 10 less gas
3889791 well why dont we increase domestic production with the land we already gave the oil companies instead of new offshore drilling sites id prefer to not do any offshore drilling but we already promised them certain areas with contracts so i hear some arguments about why the crazy libs are saying its okay to drill in one place but not another the answer is that its not we are trying to be reasonable and thinking okay so we already promised them this land so well let them have it since it was promised already we arent gunna go back on our word but to then go ahead and say that the only way to fix this problem is to start looking in new areas for oil means they have access to the old places plus the new places which is far worse we gave them land they arent using so whos fault is it really the lib dems or the oil companies i think its obvious
3889792 do you know why gas prices are declining first you do realize supply was up and demand was down for 3 years running right yet the prices soared
3889793 im not going slow im saving 10 bucks on gas a week
3889794 ive been trying to be a hero and come back too fast
3889795 ive given it all ive got this year even when people doubted that id ever pick up a ball again
3889796 im not going to pick up a ball for 12 days and im not going to go out there and pitch until my arm feels 100 percent right now im just bringing the team down
3889797 he blew up scar tissue and thats a process that he is going to have to go through
3889798 i threw about 20 25 pitches and faced a few hitters
3889799 i had good movement and good extension which is nice because i picked a bad time to get hurt
3889800 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3889801 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3889802 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3889803 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3889804 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3889805 i lost about 20 pounds but beyond that im feeling fine
3889806 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3889807 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3889808 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3889809 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3889810 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3889811 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3889812 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you
3889813 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in there mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong

3889815 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
3889816 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
3889817 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
3889818 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
3889819 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3889820 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
3889821 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
3889822 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
3889823 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
3889824 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
3889825 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
3889826 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
3889827 the timing really is good with us celebrating our 60th year of racing next year
3889828 although its not on labor day it is a 500 mile race at darlington
3889829 and thats another way of our continuing to tie back into our history and our tradition
3889830 when i think of darlington and the history of the track the southern 500 is what comes to mind
3889831 i look forward to the opportunity of possibly winning a sixth
3889832 wha again she just did bullet points im outta here

3889834 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3889835 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3889836 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3889837 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3889838 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable

3889867 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3889868 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3889869 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3889870 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook

3889899 i think we can defend it yes i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa ever that the united states has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding
3889900 this is not a recolonisation as some of our critics say or another anglo iraqi treaty of the 1930s that will bind iraq
3889901 have managed to make some compromises on all the sticky issues or problematic areas of any sofa which are universal jurisdiction detention powers of authorisation to launch military operations issues of sovereignty
3889902 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11 there could be drawdowns
3889903 the idea is really to keep these forces outside the main cities the population centres it doesnt mean that they could not enter or come through
3889904 sono contrariato perch alcune sciocchezze nel finale ci hanno impedito di vincere ha commentato il tecnico azzurro giampiero ticchi ma alle ragazze non posso rimproverare davvero nulla soprattutto dopo la reazione orgogliosa degli ultimi minuti non era facile vincere qui a danzica in un palazzetto dello sport cos caldo ma a parte il momento difficile nel secondo quarto abbiamo dimostrato che siamo competitivi avevo chiesto alla squadra di scendere idealmente in campo con lelmetto era importante dimostrare che siamo solidi

3889920 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc
3889921 were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game

3889931 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3889932 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3889933 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3889934 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3889935 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3889936 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3889937 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned

3889992 tandbergs revenues in the second quarter reflect leadership in network products as well as a strong partner base with the ability to sell a complete video solution
3889993 this leadership was further strengthened by the unveiling of an unrivaled portfolio of new products
3889994 it has long been seen as likely that one of the bigger telecommunications equipment players would be interested in tandberg like cisco and hewlett packard alert
3889995 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
