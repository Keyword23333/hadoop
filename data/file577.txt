5770119 van dyke parks brian and melinda thought this should be a love letter to los angeles at this point brian was 65 years old and it just felt right to embrace his legend and be a bit nostalgic
5770120 kind of introspective kind of how i feel around people
5770121 yes brian had a rough time of it with his mental health but i would kill to have the kind of catalogue he does and tour everywhere with his brothers like he did
5770122 when i go to the keyboard i feel holy like an angel over my head i feel very holy when we did the beach boys hit god only knows i felt holy about that too a godly something comes through me
5770123 im always thinking about melodies the melodies come from my brain and my keyboards i play a really pleasant keyboard it sounds so pleasant it makes me want to write melodies
5770124 sometimes i want to get out of the house to get away from my kids but i love my kids a lot i love my kids quiet time comes around 10 at night when i go to sleep its peace of mind things run smoothly at night during the day things are more rough

5770132 to maintain this cashs fantastic charm and personality while filing sic out the sound and creating bold re interpretations the remix producers reverence and gratitude is essential to the process the goal is to bring the sensibility and technology of 2008 to recordings universally accepted as timeless with the blessing and support of the custodians of johnny cashs legacy
5770133 i would never buy this album i view it as an insult to an american icon and i wish it had never happened
5770134 lonesome whistle but the argument could certainly be made that if johnny cash wanted pete rock to remix one of his tracks he would have done so while he was around
5770135 its one of those situations where the devil is in the details
5770136 i am extremely pleased we are thrilled we worked very hard and it is a fantastic result
5770137 i need to know where the enemy is i need to know where the civilian population is in order to kill the enemy more efficiently and effectively

5770154 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5770155 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5770156 we of course are very proud to have the french making an enhanced contribution in afghanistan
5770157 we believe its essential for all nato countries to stay the course so that we accomplish our objectives of creating a stable environment in afghanistan that is not a threat either to its people or people elsewhere in the world
5770158 the afghan national army is saying that any time we get close to them they detonate themselves
5770159 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5770160 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5770161 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convening at whatever level
5770162 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5770163 certainly there will be a lot of changes in our cooperation with nato and we will have changes in the volume the quality and the timeframe in our consultations and meetings
5770164 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia
5770165 the united states got precisely what we sought in this statement
5770166 its not every day that a sovereign country is invaded and wrecked the events of the last few weeks should make us all realize that russia means business
5770167 i think the next step after the withdrawal of the russian forces is effective international engagement which completely substitutes any russian presence on the soil of georgia

5770185 man i cant believe that they lost by that much
5770186 the versarrays dual ribbon high end gives us very high fidelity and were getting throw even beyond what we need
5770187 im only using four of the six vr112s because the top two boxes are actually throwing several hundred feet into the residential areas neighboring the venues
5770188 we configured a constant curve arrangement so the degree between each pair of boxes is the same and i can leave it set and transport the boxes just like that it comes out in a tray of three boxes facing each other and i hook up the first three lift them up add the second set put in the three pins and fly it out its very simple and quick to fly
5770189 after working with the versarray system during pre production i knew what to expect out of the cabinets
5770190 if i find myself doing a particular eq adjustment in a certain situation then ill just build that right into the program in the vsx right now the vsx units are doing crossover and some time alignment between the ribbons and the 1x12 inch woofer theres a little bit of eq going on in there some parametric stuff to shape the crossover points because the beauty of digital crossovers is that you can do all of this asymmetrical stuff and create a flatness that you couldnt do in the old analog days
5770191 we had a lot of cleanup to do to make these films sound fluid in transitions the original mono tracks were very rough with hard transitions
5770192 there was a massive amount of de humming de clicking as well as time alignment issues we had to deal with the original laser disc mix had a constant hum that wasnt apparent at the time but with the better home theater systems of today you begin to hear things of that nature
5770193 essentially paramount wanted it to sound as if these films had been released yesterday and with ted halls excellence i feel we came close to achieving that
5770194 originally they had adred all the dialog but it wasnt exactly on mark so we went back and tried to make it better
5770195 it was a challenge to rethink things yet make it look and sound right and in the end we were able to make everything come together

5770210 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

5770246 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
5770247 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
5770248 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
5770249 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
5770250 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
5770251 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
5770252 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
5770253 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
5770254 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
5770255 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
5770256 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
5770257 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
5770258 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
5770259 they do a fantastic job and we want them back doing what they do well

5770277 cessation of all cross border interventions and inter provincial claims of jurisdiction
5770278 one point made over and over again on many of the blogs of the bishops who attended lambeth 2008 was the dismay at the amount of misinformation i wonder how much of it was disinformation about what tecs doctrinal positions are bishops of tec and spent no little time straightening out badly informed bishops from other provinces many of them also did not realize that tec had been observing moritoria on the national level as requrested by windsor whatever else lambeth did or did not accomplish these face to face conversations surely played an important role of informing all bishops on a personal level ours certainly learned a lot as well
5770279 the first difficulty is the moral equivalence implied between the three moratoria a notion specifically rejected in the original windsor report and at dromantine
5770280 the bishop asked us to do two things first not to speak out against the resolution and secondly to vote for it even if we didnt want to realign his reasoning was that a strong majority vote would provide an impetus for the presiding bishops office to negotiate with him especially over issues of property
5770281 even though the group was prepared to issue a statement before the vote stating our opposition to it when the bishops request was taken back to the group we decided to honor the request none of us spoke out against the resolution to realign either before or during convention and i assume that some in the group voted for it as well
5770282 the bishop said he understood this and asked if we could wait until march 1st in order to provide time for him to negotiate with the presiding bishops office
5770283 all have sinned and have fallen short of the glory of the lord
5770284 its like a prison its got coils of barbed wire we cant go through nobody can go through
5770285 we had to go all the way around took another hour and a half to get back home

5770291 how do economically challenging times affect in home meal strategies
5770292 virgin blue shares had their biggest drop after the carrier reported its first half year loss because of higher fuel prices
5770293 we never went out during the time we were training
5770294 our school is quite strict when we stay in school we cant go out on our own let alone when were at a military camp
5770295 north korea is no 1 in the world when it comes to uniformity they are uniform beyond belief these kind of traditional synchronized movements result in a sense of beauty we chinese are able to achieve this as well though hard training and strict discipline
5770296 in one week we could only work four and a half days we had to have coffee breaks twice a day couldnt go into overtime and just a little discomfort was not allowed because of human rights
5770297 you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month
5770298 at one point the children had to run in four different directions when one fell others quickly followed
5770299 we had only two meals for the entire time there was almost no time to sleep even less time for toilet breaks
5770300 but we didnt feel so angry because the director was also there with us the whole time
5770301 our aim is for byog to reduce the carbon footprint from the production etching and trucking of the souvenir glasses
5770302 it should cut down on waste too since most souvenir glasses end up in the landfill or are retired into a cabinet never to be seen again
5770303 weve been to countless events where plastic water bottles are discarded half full it got so depressing to watch the recycling cans fill up with all that waste so we decided to do something about it
5770304 making my own wine at microcrush was one of the most fulfilling and exciting experiences i
5770305 i have enormous respect for the complexity of the process and for the ease and good humor with which judd and art guided me through it
5770306 my nose completely clogs up my throat will sometimes depending on the type of allergy close up as well redy puffy eyes just very itchy
5770307 we found that stress and anxiety make a big difference in terms of allergic responses
5770308 if you dont have an allergy youre just going to see a little bit of redness temporarily and thatll be the end of it but if youre a highly allergic person youre going to get something called a wheal
5770309 so the take home message is if youre allergic stress and anxiety are a bad combination
5770310 there is a substantial faction of younger players who are eager to play with aaron rodgers favre is at least a decade older than all but six guys on the roster he dressed in his own locker room he had minimal social interaction with teammates rodgers is one of the guys and plenty of them are pulling for him
5770311 the officer was given several opportunities to present her case but she refused to cooperate with the committee notwithstanding the committee completed the inquiry on may 19 2008 and found that her allegations could not be substantiated
5770312 moreover the committee found that her behaviour on a number of occasions duly documented by the committee appears to indicate a disturbed state of mind and recommended medical counseling which she subsequently refused
5770313 she was indeed suffering from depression and it was deliberately done
5770314 we are going to register a case against her but she is not yet fit to record her statement
5770315 it was pretty obvious that there was going to be a gap in the workload and the cash flow for places like the bath iron works if the navy tried to shift back to the arleigh burke destroyer quickly
5770316 almost everybody in new england was up in arms about this surprise decision to stop building the zumwalt class
5770317 the navy is getting pushback on the argument that the arleigh burke is better on missile defense than the ddg 1000 would be
5770318 theres a certain kind of sleight of hand involved in claiming that cold war destroyers are better at that mission than more modern radars and missiles would be

5770343 i feel we have some contestants that actually have real long term potential in the music industry
5770344 its important to pick the right song for your voice and the right song for you something you can believe in and something with a lyric that means something to you
5770345 you have to make sure that you look good and im not just talking about wearing nice clothes you have to be able to wear the clothes so it feels authentic you cant be costumey you cant be dressed up to the point where its not believable you have to be able to walk the walk
5770346 the way he wore it it felt real it felt authentic
5770347 you have to be authentic and you have to make people believe what youre doing its about your performance performance has to do with how you sing how you look how you move whether you choose to move
5770348 one of the reasons i think that mitch is still in the competition is hes so likable he can sing too but hes such a likable guy that you want to root for him
5770349 miles davis was notorious for spending most of the show with his back to the audience
5770350 the challenge is to reinvent it without people going what was that
5770351 there are a couple of people who shall remain nameless who have more of a safe approach to singing which now gives them an opportunity to do something more risky that will really really set them apart from the memory people already have of them and put them in the limelight because we will certainly recognize that and comment on it and bring it to the fore so its almost like a latent strategy
5770352 its a win win situation if you do it and it works fantastic if you do it and it dont work you leave at least with some sort of lasting memory with the understanding that you want to have a career in the music industry
5770353 you want to move on in the show with a sense of definition and you also want to leave the show with a sense of definition its another win win situation song choice is probably the biggest indicator of what people can expect on your record
5770354 the four of us have collectively maybe 100 years in the music business
5770355 every single show is your last show every single song is your last song every single note is your last note so sing it that way perform it that way be that last performance

5770390 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5770391 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5770392 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left

5770404 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation

5770406 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women
5770407 anyone could be the next target if doctors are allowed to pick and choose their patients based on religious views about other groups of people

5770704 i dont think it would be productive for our football team you have to be a productive part to be an nfl player and theres responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege its not a right theres a lot that comes with being an nfl football player
5770705 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team

5770712 we are going to have to go to alternative energy and the exploitation of existing reserves of oil natural gas even coal and we can develop clean coal technology are all great things but we also have to devote our efforts in my view to alternative energy sources which is the ultimate answer to our long term energy needs and we need it sooner rather than later
5770713 be very helpful in the short term resolving our energy crisis
5770714 i believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use
5770715 as a matter of fairness to the american people and a matter of duty for our government we must deal with the here and now and assure affordable fuel for america by increasing domestic production
5770716 can i just say that this young man just pointed out that that he believes in states rights and so do i and the people of louisiana decided that they wanted to drill off of their coast and they do the people of california and the people of florida those two states decided that they didnt what i would like to do frankly is to maybe give them a greater source of the revenues to help maybe encourage them to allow some kind of exploration far off of their shores but if i told the state of california youve got to have drilling off of your coast that would frankly be a contradiction of what were just talking about about thats their land and thats off of their coast

5770721 but i would be doing this anyway because i feel john mccain will make a great president he is one of the most authentic leaders i have ever seen
5770722 john mccain has stood up against his party and his president
5770723 there is a hunger now in this country for a leader a president who is clearly bi partisan a leader who will reach across the aisle to solve problems
5770724 its my goal in this position to target independents and democrats to vote for john mccain
5770725 first i have a personal reason to support sen mccain my dad was a prisoner of war like mccain second like sen clinton mccain has worked across the aisle to get things done and thats what we need
5770726 most of the democrats i have talked to feel that obamas positions would move the country too far to the left
5770727 people look at this race and they realize that whoever gets this job will have a tough road ahead
5770728 the economy is bad and there are crises all over the world when they look at obamas resume they just dont see the qualifications there

5770778 the democratic party also strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and post natal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
5770779 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
5770780 up to this point i never thought it was an issue as to whether to allow her to have a baby
5770781 but the democrats are making such an issue out of it that it might be a possibility
5770782 the draft platform shows a growing understanding that reproductive choice and rights include not only abortion but also the right to have the resources to care for children
5770783 it is very promising that there is a plank on reproductive health care in the opening section on health care coverage although it does not specify abortion we must include the full range of reproductive health care services in universal health care coverage and this will be controversial
5770784 the democratic party also strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which empowers people to make informed choices and live healthy lives we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
5770785 the language in this platform reaffirms in the strongest of terms the democratic partys solid commitment to a womans right to choose as defined by roe v wade
5770786 we are pleased that the party adopted language that is consistent with naral pro choice americas work to ensure that women have access to a full range of reproductive health options including preventing unintended pregnancy bearing healthy children and choosing safe legal abortion
5770787 we are also pleased that during the full platform committee hearings no debates changes or amendments were raised related to a womans right to choose
5770788 its very clear the party is still for abortion on demand unrestricted and paid for by the taxpayers
5770789 if anyone is taken in by this language then they are not pro life its ridiculous

5770815 i just about bet out but then quickly realized this would be a mistake if i didnt think he had any kind of small flush that he would pay me with i might as well check and try to induce a bluff so thats what i did once he put me all in for my remaining 18k i didnt have to think very long at all
5770816 i dont know the answer but ill get back to you

5770833 while the management of tubelines has put much effort into scapegoating the rmt in this dispute by calling their action political they havent bothered to sit down and negotiate a settlement the only guarantee of a quick resolution to this crisis is for morgan and co to sit down with the rmt and listen to the grave concerns the rmt have about the pay settlement for their members in tubelines
5770834 tim parker is the third key figure to resign in less than four months reflecting the rushed nature of appointments and giving an appearance of chaos in the new administration londoners deserve a better deal from the man they have entrusted to run their city

5770860 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does
5770861 what he does as part of his routine is to gee up the crowd they speed up and then slow down the music and create a whirlpool effect in the crowd
5770862 they the crowd all get geed up and then they start fighting
5770863 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5770864 unless the python that is the u s economy can quickly pass the recent burst of cost push pressures we risk a reinforcing spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations
5770865 should this happen and the fed were to fail to address it we would run the risk of losing the publics confidence in our ability to constrain inflation
5770866 if you were a yachtsman you would say that we sailed the economy along in a following sea for a long time now we are navigating force 10 seas everyone is battening down the hatches
5770867 the correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom credit markets remain tempestuous
5770868 have no intention of squandering the bedrock capital of a central bank the confidence the public places in our hands to keep inflation at bay while we work to bolster economic growth and restore the financial system
5770869 i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost spirit and with fire

5770871 and as 1 began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning on the day of pentecost then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost

5770900 your driving a tank through my office wall shows you have gumption
5770901 and obviously good credit to rent it i admire gumption almost as much as i admire small companies that i can take over
5770902 you got producers showing product to other companies left and right your precious synergy at work and youre delaying big projects for specious reasons why not one more
5770903 i want to find out the real reason why we cant have the watchmen theyve all been locked up and i want to know why
5770904 dont you already have lawyers and that to figure it all out
5770905 but they use big words and big words make me tired solve this case and ill let you keep the wallet you and harry potter stole the last time
5770906 but i wont tell because if anyone else knew what i knew i wouldnt be the smartest man in the world anymore
5770907 im a private dick hired to find out why youre locked up
5770908 i need to know why the watchmen are locked up
5770909 i was just about to toss another shrimp on the barbie
5770910 i came here to find out why you locked up the watchmen
5770911 they were supposed to work for me but then they went to work for the warner brothers but i own their asses
5770912 why didnt you do anything when they tried working with the other studios why lock them up now
5770913 but the warner brothers actually got them working and to top it all off the trailer looks pretty bad ass and since my business plan of driving away all potential hitmakers kept me from having any 100 million hits this summer i decided to be a dick about everything and sue

5770919 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5770920 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5770921 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left

5770924 the russians are alcohol sodden barbarians but now and then they vomit up a genius the empire of the czars hasnt produced such a frightening genius since joseph stalin
5770925 the new reality is that a nuclear cash rich and energy blessed russia doesnt really worry too much whether its long term future is bleak given problems with muslim minorities poor life expectancy rates and a declining population instead in the here and now it has a window of opportunity to reclaim prestige and weaken its adversaries
5770926 you know that our countrys population is declining by an average of almost 700 000 people a year we have raised this issue on many occasions but have for the most part done very little to address it first we need to lower the death rate second we need an effective migration policy and third we need to increase the birth rate

5770936 for most of human existence your pattern of sleeping and wakefulness was basically a matter of the sun and the season
5770937 when the nature of work changed from a schedule built around the sun to an indoor job timed by a clock humans had to adapt the widespread use of caffeinated food and drink in combination with the invention of electric light allowed people to cope with a work schedule set by the clock not by daylight or the natural sleep cycle
5770938 developing our oil sands has had its environmental challenges but weve come a long way
5770939 we will also be introducing tough new regulations that will require even more dramatic cuts
5770940 we tried the inside approach to bringing about change and the government has said yup we hear what youre saying and we agree that these are the problems and yet they havent been willing to step up
5770941 we feel weve exhausted the possibility of working within cema to bring about changes
5770942 i dont think what pembina is saying is that cema does bad scientific work
5770943 i think pembinas frustration and the frustration of the first nations and the frustration of a lot of members is the politics that when things come out it seems to take a long time to see a result
5770944 the whole issue of north american energy security coupled with responsible environmental stewardship are the flip sides of the same issue
5770945 the oil sands are critical to north american energy security and its important that we explain not only to the americans but internationally the responsible way in which those developments are going to unfold

5770953 two consecutive elevated readings on core consumer prices combined with todays worrisome report on producer prices will be hard for the fed to overlook at its next meeting
5770954 that said recent and further evidence of significant economic weakness makes it unlikely for the fed to push up interest rates this year
5770955 inflation is more systemic than they were leading us to believe in the past numbers and it will continue to show up in the cpi number for months to come the question is whether or not investors can shake it off knowing that the price of oil has come down
5770956 the fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place and it shows
5770957 the u s economy is growing and showing great flexibility but we are in a period of slow growth

5770959 thousands of young people on princes trust schemes support their community every year with many actively volunteering to help older age groups there are young people across the uk with energy and enthusiasm that if harnessed could be a powerful force for change
5770960 older people clearly have an important role to play in their communities and many already give much of their time and expertise to others as grandparents carers and volunteers negative ageist stereotypes often disappear when different generations come together and learn to understand and appreciate each other breaking down barriers in this way undoubtedly lays the ground for building stronger communities
5770961 we share the same streets and supermarkets and this research shows that contrary to popular opinion we do know each other people of all ages want to know the people who live around them and to feel part of a community and enjoy socializing and supporting each other uk older peoples day on 1st october is the perfect opportunity to build on this and get to know older people in your neighborhood making sure no one is left out whatever their age
5770962 the development of the paraguayan people their industry and agriculture
5770963 venezuela will guarantee the full supply of oil to paraguay all the oil that paraguay needs in this century venezuelan has it and venezuela guarantees it for the development of paraguay
5770964 surely san pedro will be a backbone for the construction of a new agricultural potential in paraguay
5770965 mission miracle 2 project by creating two ophthalmology centers in paraguay mission miracle 2 deals with the diagnosis and treatment of eye disorders and diseases
5770966 paraguay has become part of the tendency of governments of the center left what is called the axis of evil which means that the people are heading toward the unity of all and to change
5770967 there is a lot of interest in paraguay about what is happening in venezuela people have high expectations of us
5770968 our adversaries keep trying to impede our union the pitiyanquis us government sympathizers are worse than the yankees because they grovel they infiltrate every one of these countries bowing down to the yankees and betraying their own people planting discord
5770969 in this beautiful town of san pedro i give you in the name of the venezuelan people and of the bolivarian revolution this sword which i personally call the sword of liberty the original is a sword that the people of peru gave to bolivar when he returned after the battle of ayacucho in 1824
5770970 we have to slow down industry to let us catch up if we continue to let industry and government behave the way theyve been behaving the last 40 years there will be no turnback because it will be the total destruction of the land
5770971 we believe that the pace of development within our territories is unsustainable and we are deeply concerned that governments are permitting development to proceed without our consent
5770972 i think this will send a strong message to government
5770973 as first nations people were supposed to stay quiet and let everything be no more
5770974 what is happening here in this region is affecting everybody we as first nations people have the power to let the government and industry know no more
5770975 weve taken some bold steps and bold steps are what we need
5770976 this is frankly an eye opener for our people what the people are experiencing here

5770998 oggi e il momento di chiedere il rispetto degli impegni presi di occuparsi delle popolazioni colpite da questa grave crisi di confermare che il dialogo con la russia resta aperto purche la russia mostri buona volonta allora e chiaro che dare giudizi analizzare storicamente valutare colpe e responsabilita avrebbe portato su una china totalmente improduttiva

5771010 i like everything there its a beautiful campus they have great facilities the coaches are real good i like the players they have it all
5771011 theyve started to send me a lot of handwritten letters and stuff
5771012 i want to take some visits and see who else offers
5771013 they said that theres a strong chance they will offer they seem to like me a lot and i think the coaches there are great plus i love their tradition and its just a great place overall
5771014 it was a very good experience i liked getting to know the coaches better and i definitely think theyll do well this year they work really hard and the coaches are very smart
5771015 they have a great program there and they are always a top team and im sure the new staff will keep it that way i really have a lot of respect for their coaches

5771018 the aca has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we cant recommend to our players they should tour pakistan for the champions trophy
5771019 we feel for the pakistan cricket board and the people of pakistan but it is the job of the aca to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour unfortunately in this case we dont believe it is safe
5771020 we have not heard anything officially from cricket australia and until we do we are not in a position to make any comment
5771021 what we have done is to very clearly outline to each of these stakeholders the plan that we have in place for the champions trophy in pakistan
5771022 understandably there are safety concerns and thats what we are engaged in and we are dealing with
5771023 the ecb has received a briefing from us and have gone into a board meeting they will consider our briefing among other reports that they may have on whether they will participate or not but that is a decision for the ecb as far as the icc are concerned the safety and security is satisfactory for hosting the tournament in pakistan
5771024 its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5771025 i wouldnt be able to tell you what would be in the minds of the icc board when it sits to consider such an eventuality it would be great for the best teams to attend and every one of the best players to come
5771026 i think weve got to a position where its very difficult to do it to the position where we could stage a successful world class event
5771027 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move it is speculative until member boards or teams clearly indicate what their view is as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5771028 every single day our security advisors update themselves and in turn us on the changing political environment in pakistan the advice on the current development is that the status quo remains unchanged if anything it is a step in the right direction and im quoting their words

5771069 you know you drop the mouthpiece in boiling water for 15 seconds take it out dip it in cold water and pop it right into your mouth and clamp down hard and suck in through your teeth and keep it there a couple of minutes for the mouthpiece to take a good impression of your teeth
5771070 you want your legal mouthpiece to do the hot water immersion and the legal teeth impression taking for the good of the client if you dont mold your mouthpiece just right youre going to find yourself in litigation where your mouthpiece doesnt protect you properly and youre going to bite your legal tongue off and then your mouthpiece might get dislodged and some teeth might get knocked out and youre going to have legal gaps like a hockey player and i dont want that because my smile is so very photogenic see
5771071 i was thinking maybe that commission could honor the black wednesday appointees by declaring a potty break and retiring to the bathrooms en masse while the replacement appointees serenaded the wednesday appointees with for hes a jolly good fellow

5771077 a little eye gouging action to the tune of for hes a jolly good fellow i could be down with that

5771140 we could leave here in two minutes but weve had no orders to pull out
5771141 practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all what theyre trying to do is to widen their territorial presence
5771142 they have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action they are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now
5771143 i might be naive but im still hopeful that a very strong common effort by europe and the united states will be effective in the withdrawing of russian troops from territory of georgia
5771144 according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5771145 war columns are already leaving the main pullout will take place today it takes a long time to pack up a tank
5771146 russian forces are not leaving they are merely rotating their hardware one comes another one goes

5771154 never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity

5771156 amazing rare things the art of natural history in the age of discovery
5771157 well the royal collection has a gallery attached to it and regularly shows things from the collection
5771158 i mean its quite remarkable how you actually have to know how something works before you can draw it accurately and thats a very interesting little problem i mean theres a drawing from a man called cassiano dal pozzo he commissioned artists to draw these things and the artist is faced with for example a sloth or maybe you call it a sloth but it as you well know it spends its life hanging upside down now you couldnt possibly know that it spends its life upside down if youd just been sent the skin unless you really understood the mechanics of the thing and they looked at this and they naturally drew it as if it was standing horizontally but in the normal sort of way with its feet beneath it and the result is i mean to our eye of course grossly unnatural almost comic because it doesnt work that way so you really have to understand about these creatures before you can draw them accurately
5771159 she was a widow and she earned her living selling insect specimens in holland and in the mid 50s she decided that shed like to go and see many of these specimens that she had been selling and draw them in the wild and so off she hopped with her daughter to suriname and there she collected caterpillars and watched them as they metamorphosed into the adult insects not knowing what they were going to turn into and produced as a result of this some magnificent plates which subsequently became very famous indeed and very beautiful they are too you can certainly tell a merian drawing she has a deep affection for curls i mean she cant resist a curl
5771160 most potential routes of infection are controlled through current procedures
5771161 however the outbreak in suffolk appears to be the outcome of a series of normally low probability events and circumstances which cumulatively led to the introduction of disease
5771162 although we cannot be sure how the outbreak happened this episode reflects the need for constant vigilance high levels of biosecurity and robust and well developed contingency planning in dealing with animal disease outbreaks
5771163 of course well look for an opportunity to debate this and all of us are uncomfortable about the reports of high levels of compensation paid to mr matthews firm

5771174 the national platform is a bunch of gobbledy gook but my biggest concern is that issues regarding extreme environmentalism and the cap and trade legislation will be added in what needs to be added to the platform is a pledge that the republican party will start upholding the constitution

5771181 2003 data from scarborough research a consumer market company only 40 percent of people aged 18 to 24 read a paper on weekdays and less than half on sundays 48 percent
5771182 the more important trend today may be what is happening to readers between the ages of 34 and 64 the people who should be the prime target for becoming citizens engaged in civil society these are the people buying houses having children worrying about schools building their careers running for office becoming leaders in their communities their numbers are declining as well and in some cases at a faster rate than for people under 34

5771217 was marketing masquerading as science said lead author kevin hill of harvard medical school in boston who was one of several authors paid as consultants by law firms preparing litigation against merck the authors were given access to the internal merck documents all part of litigation
5771218 patients and physicians werent told about the marketing objectives of the trial
5771219 if i had sensed that there was an ulterior motive for physicians to have an amplified experience with the drug i would have never done that according to butwinick

5771226 when i was doing the research for this report i asked sites how hard their traffic had been hit by the introduction of in stream ads
5771227 the answer was very little usually they reported flat growth for a month or two or a few percent down before normal growth continued
5771228 half the people that leave because of the ad would have left because of the content anyway its like flicking through channels on tv
5771229 it makes sense that in stream ads are more popular because everyone has broadband now and we expect to see richer content on the web
5771230 its also a return to allowing people to sit back again people can relax and be entertained which might be refreshing in this cluttered call to action environment
5771231 they give online publishers access to a revenue stream that many are still missing out on
5771232 they are frightened to accept ads because consumers always say they dont like them and youtube terrifies them by saying that ads lose them the vast majority of traffic

5771248 rennie curran has really given us a boost with his ability to play with a lot of instinct and speed and hes a direct hitter
5771249 youre always looking for a guy that can hit somebody square and knock them back and hes been able to do that
5771250 he makes a lot of direct hits which is why hes such a good tackler
5771251 he has that focal point right down the cylinder and hes able to hit it most of the time because of his speed and instincts he plays low he bends his knees well he stays square to the line of scrimmage when hes getting ready to make a tackle his feet are closer than most guys thats why he rarely misses and hes strong really strong
5771252 then you see him on the field and hes like godzilla

5771259 as voters in the 1st district choose whom they will support in the september 9th primary it is critical that they know the records of the candidates and the differences between us
5771260 there is a significant difference in my record and jeb bradleys on the issues most important to the public wasteful spending and energy independence the people want change in washington and this ad shows that i am the candidate with the record for delivering change
5771261 ive been disappointed that jeb bradley could not support even a 1 cut in spending and still supports wasteful earmarks
5771262 there is only one fiscal conservative in this race for congress it is john stephen there is also only one candidate in the race who has consistently supported new energy exploration thats also john stephen on the issues that matter to the voters in the primary on september 9th john stephen is the one person who represents their values this ad makes that point clearly

5771265 almost everybody in new england was up in arms about this surprise decision to stop building the zumwalt class
5771266 the navy is getting pushback on the argument that the arleigh burke is better on missile defense than the ddg 1000 would be
5771267 theres a certain kind of sleight of hand involved in claiming that cold war destroyers are better at that mission than more modern radars and missiles would be

5771301 its always happening in pakistan we used to do it in pakistan but we moved here and we didnt do it here because under 16s arent allowed to do
5771302 i suggest to you that you did it entirely voluntarily
5771303 i suggested to you that not only did he not force you but that you did it very happily for a number of reasons
5771304 firstly you have done it before havent you this was not by any means a new experience for you was it i would say to you you might have been six or seven when you first did it that would be right
5771305 you like anybody else got very caught up in the atmosphere its quite an emotional time if you are an observant shia muslim the whole idea is that its a time of remembrance isnt it like everybody else you got very caught up in the sadness and the mood didnt you

5771309 i think the third quarter will be fine based on some technical adjustments with inventory and continued strong trade but the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2009 do not look good it is all dependent upon housing prices

5771311 the work that meals on wheels does for seniors in our community is really inspiring
5771312 so when we realized how much they were being impacted by the rising gas prices it was natural for barona to donate this first tanker of gas to meals on wheels
5771313 we are very grateful to receive this donation from barona
5771314 in this time of high gas prices increased food costs and fewer community donations this wonderful contribution will allow meals on wheels to offset some of the escalated costs involved in the delivery of hot meals to our seniors in need
5771315 the tanker a day promotion is a fun and exciting way for barona and our players to deal with rising gas prices
5771316 but its equally as exciting for us to be able to help meals on wheels continue to serve the community as they do
5771317 stresses associated with climate change such as hightemperature episodes that promote coral bleaching reduced calcification and changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation present one set of challenges to coral reefs

5771319 our results suggest that present coral reef calcification rates are equivalent to levels in the late 19th century and does not support previous suggestions of large and potentially catastrophic decreases in the future

5771607 gassee is articulating his strategy for entry into the operating system marketplace but on the other hand i know that be has built a full featured operating system so what i believe hes doing here is outlining his strategy about how he will initially co exist with windows and over time attract more applications to his platform

5771610 im 39 and ive worked all over the world asia europe canada and the u s i recently returned to a top american ivy league school for a masters i was stunned to discover the degree to which canadian immigration is being abused
5771611 i had dinner with six good buddies all from questionable foreign countries pakistan syria all great guys and i found out they were all canadian
5771612 none of these guys has spent more than a few weeks in canada yet four were citizens and two were permanent residents who will become full blown citizens shortly
5771613 they come from rich families in corrupt countries and they travel the world freely on our passports without ever paying a dime in tax heres how it works
5771614 extremely rich people from corrupt countries apply for permanent residency at their local embassy and it is my guess that their certain special influence is exerted so they can get themselves and members of the family into canada as immigrants
5771615 they visit canada for a few weeks get bank accounts buy a condo then hit the road and leave canada letting the clock tick until they qualify for canadian citizenship
5771616 once they have a passport the party begins and they can come back and forth to use our services at will without contributing to taxes
5771617 these people are rich beyond our wildest dreams a spare condo in toronto or vancouver is chump change if one looks upon it as free entitlements like health care needed insurance against a collapse at home or a change in government
5771618 i started chatting with a guy from india who was a landed immigrant even though he had never even visited canada he obtained his residence permit by applying in singapore then moved directly to the u s where he studied at a mediocre school
5771619 he is trying to become a permanent u s resident and when i suggested that he could just work for a canadian bank in toronto where salaries were roughly the same he looked utterly disgusted that i could even make such a suggestion
5771620 i assure you he will get our passport and use us like dogs travel and work worldwide without paying a dollar in taxes or giving a damn about the place its a step up to a more respected passport for free
5771621 this is so common in the u s that i just stopped paying attention but it is important and relevant because these guys are not only cheapening the canadian good name but they are taking up previous immigration seats that our economy desperately needs furthermore processing each permanent resident and new citizen costs money

5771643 local communities have recorded their trauma on video and say the reservoir is being deliberately filled now to forcibly evict those villages that have been most outspoken in calling for fair compensation and replacement lands as many as 25 villages could ultimately be affected by the rising waters
5771644 the inundation of the manasir lands followed on the 24 of july
5771645 up to july 28th seven villages and inhabited islands were completely submerged the victims were 205 families and their number is expected to increase to more than two thousand families by the end of the flood season in mid october it is a pity that the government has taken strict security measures to deny the access of the press and the humanitarian organizations to the affected area it has neither provided relief nor allowed others to provide such help it even prevented the un representatives to visit the affected area in order to assess or monitor the situation it also deliberately disconnected the sudani wireless communication service which is the only available service in the affected area it also refused to release key data such as the reservoir contour highest level the dam operation system and the environmental impact assessment
5771646 this severe flooding did not take the manasir by surprise it was clear to them that the government would never honor its agreement so they depended on themselves and took emergency measures they made different arrangements and organized themselves into different task force groups they could successfully rescue all the victims with their movable properties losing only their homes and planted crops they provided the victims with temporary shelter food provisions and fodder for their animals they will continue supplying them with provisions depending on their limited resources till the victims are able to sustain themselves and begin a new life starting from the scratch the ecm therefore made this emergency appeal for all benevolent inside the sudan and abroad for help it also meant that all people get informed with their real problem in order to sympathize with their case and to appreciate their great sacrifice for the benefit of all sudan

5771715 whoever has the courage to step in can reap healthy returns later on the question is whether you are willing to sit it through
5771716 the problem in russia has been a lack of transparency and weak property rights laws and western investors are nervous about things from that standpoint

5771725 but i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia
5771726 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5771727 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism

5771754 the top 100 metro areas generate two thirds of our jobs nearly 80 percent of patents and handle 75 percent of all seaport tonnage in fact 42 of our metro areas now rank among the worlds 100 largest economies
5771755 to prosper nations must leverage four key assets innovation human capital infrastructure and quality places which concentrate at an unprecedented level in metropolitan areas
5771756 our nations ability to grow and prosper and meet the great social and environmental challenges of our time is at risk unless these metropolitan engines of national prosperity are healthy and vital

5771789 here i am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily with books with one eye on my typewriter and the other on licorice the cat who has a great fondness for carbon paper and i am telling you that the emperor napoleon was a most contemptible person but should i happen to look out of the window down upon seventh avenue and hear the sound of heavy drums and see the little man on his white horse in his old and much worn green uniform then i dont know but i am afraid that i would leave my books and the kitten and my home and everything else to follow him wherever he cared to lead my own grandfather did this and heaven knows he was not born to be a hero
5771790 monthly data for july show that the broad money growth has almost collapsed
5771791 its obviously worrying people either cant borrow or dont want to borrow even if they can
5771792 there are always short term blips but over the long run m3 has repeatedly shown itself good leading indicator
5771793 the worst is yet to come in the u s
5771794 the financial sector needs to shrink i dont think simply having a couple of medium sized banks and a couple of small banks going under is going to do the job
5771795 they need to be nationalized the equity holders should lose all their money probably we need to guarantee the bonds simply because the u s has led everyone into believing they would guarantee the bonds
5771796 like any shrinking industries we are going to see the exit of some major players
5771797 were really going to see a consolidation even among the major investment banks
5771798 the only way to put discipline into the system is to allow some companies to go bust
5771799 you cant just have an industry where they make giant profits or they get bailed out
5771800 they must realize were going to get inflation if things stay where they are they need to raise rates but i dont think they are going to because theyre way too nervous
5771801 we agree with the call for treasury intervention and think it is very very likely to happen before the end of the third quarter
5771802 without government help we think there is very little chance of freddie completing a significant capital raising
5771803 as the secretary has said we have no plans to use these authorities
5771804 if theyre unable to tap the markets to raise capital i think were talking a matter of quarters before the government has to step in
5771805 as the secretary has said many times we have no plans on using the authority
5771806 i think every day that goes by without the companies raising capital the possibility of the treasury stepping in increases
5771807 hank paulsons gamble is that if the treasury commits to investing in fannie and freddie if required it will never have to put money in
5771808 i would say it still has a good chance of succeeding but it may get lower odds than it would have a month ago
5771809 the now near explicit government guarantee behind gse credit should theoretically have caused agency spreads to tighten
5771810 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5771811 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5771812 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5771813 if the recapitalisation talk is realised there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 per cent guaranteed
5771814 he fought it tooth and nail the money had to go somewhere it went into nasdaq stocks
5771815 infectious greed seemed to grip much of our business community
5771816 once in a generation frenzy of speculation that is now over
5771817 bubble in home prices for the nation as a whole
5771818 hes like the forensic pathologist brought in as an expert on how to fix things when in fact he played a large role in causing the problems
5771819 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
5771820 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
5771821 im reminded of the song by dan hicks amp the hot licks
5771822 how can i miss you if you wont go away
5771823 lehman continues to have significant exposure to mortgages and asset backed securities
5771824 we believe management wants to leave its mortgage troubles behind and restore confidence
5771825 we dont think the ratings agencies would welcome this divestiture
5771826 the best would be to sell 20 percent to the public
5771827 the one thing that sets them apart is they tend to make pretty bold moves
5771828 the market already expected ubs to make some profit next year
5771829 but the question is how profitable it will be this is something that i dont think even mr kurer knows
5771830 once ubs reduces the write downs substantially it will be profitable again
5771831 the estimate is a moving number it was above 8 8 billion some weeks ago and it is still falling
5771832 even if it looks like it will never end it will
5771833 whistleblower complaints relating to working practices in the u s cross border business
5771834 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5771835 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5771836 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
5771837 the home buying public is going to have to pay
5771838 to stay competitive in the market and take steps to preserve market share
5771839 the supply of housing continues to be cut in response to the still relatively high inventories of unsold homes
5771840 this will continue to generate a large negative drag on overall growth in the second half of 2008
5771841 the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent
5771842 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5771843 now the focus is on how long the downturn will last
5771844 the economy isnt likely to recover until 2010 and rates wont rise before then
5771845 we think that the chances of a major deterioration are small
5771846 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path
5771847 if the downside risks to the economy turn out to decrease there will be an increased risk that prolonging the period of accommodative financial conditions will lead to swings in economic activity and prices
5771848 the bank of japan will resume seeking normalization of interest rates once the economy shows signs of a recovery
5771849 still its hard to anticipate a hike this year or even early next year
5771850 the lack of mortgage finance is central to the problem
5771851 london in particular appears to be having its own special summer sale with over 21 000 pounds off in a month
5771852 there is a feeling of chill in the economic air
5771853 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment
5771854 is set to become increasingly painful for consumers over the next year
5771855 this will damage germanys economic standing the controls should be restricted to questions of national security in the face of such regulations any financier is going to think twice about whether he should be investing here at all
5771856 the new rules are very modest and only allow government interference in foreign investment projects in very few cases
5771857 in germanys place i wouldnt sell anything to a russian or a chinese state fund
5771858 this wealth position has been a mental driver of consumer strength over the past couple of years
5771859 mortgages rising at 13 per cent a year are is totally inconsistent with what were seeing in the economy
5771860 when the economy is slowing and credit is accelerating something is wrong here something is not good
5771861 we are at the early stages of a softening trend
5771862 there are also early signs that the pace of growth in non mortgage consumer credit is slowing overall consumer credit is now expanding by just over 10 per cent on a year over year basis look for this figure to trend lower in the coming six months
5771863 absent any further appeals we expect the restructuring to close by sept 30 2008
5771864 it is a fair expectation that somebody is going to apply for leave to appeal
5771865 its an issue of national importance which is the primary ground the supreme court of canada looks to and they also look to the issue of whether theres a conflict at the appellate level which we clearly have in this case
5771866 all were doing is getting ready as soon as we reasonably can to close this transaction we dont know whether there will be an appeal or not if there is an appeal we will deal with it
5771867 on the other hand we have a lot of clients that need their money so well do the best we can to move this forward as fast as possible
5771868 people who sold the paper to the potential appellants to do whatever they can to arrive at a reasonable settlement with them
5771869 the reality is that some of them the upset investors are damn lucky they didnt win the appeal here because they begin to realize theyd be a hell of a lot better off with the restructured paper
5771870 in a very very small minority of cases in which its asked for in this case you have two decisions of the ontario court approving the plan and a very strong decision from the court of appeal today
5771871 what lies underneath todays decline is investors concerns about the prospects for the global economy anything related to financial companies is taken negatively
5771872 adds to the speculation that no one really knows the extent of assets that were infected by the subprime contagion
5771873 there is no confidence at all and no money entering the market to clean up this mess so no one can call a floor now
5771874 the top leadership is carefully considering an economic stimulus package
5771875 this is in addition to the cost of rebuilding sichuan earthquake zone with the budget of 500 billion yuan to 600 billion yuan
5771876 this crisis is different a once or twice a century event deeply routed in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions
5771877 theres a lot more restructuring ahead in the financial sector and the global economy has a lot of adjustments to make to the commodities shock
5771878 global financial markets continue to be fragile and indicators of systemic risk remain elevated
5771879 a bottom for the us housing market is not yet visible
5771880 the subprime crisis is a result of massive us borrowing that kept interest rates artificially low in the united states
5771881 and that lulled people into thinking that there was no risk because credit was so freely available
5771882 if the aftermath of september 11 in the united states and the stock market problems worldwide central banks were inclined to be accommodative
5771883 lehman brothers will vigorously defend any legal proceedings commenced where we do not feel there is merit
5771884 lehman brothers denies the claims wingecarribee council has made in its statement of claim filed with the federal court
5771885 it would be a relief to see either combination emerge as a clear trend a global slowdown pulling inflation down with it and an easing of the credit crunch or a continued credit crunch and emerging market led inflation pushing up prices for real assets either one would mean an end to the stagflationary rut were in that is eroding the value of all assets together
5771886 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5771887 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5771888 that fraud has increased and appraisal fraud has increased in a way to exacerbate the problems
5771889 the higher the loan amount the more money brokers and lenders make in the deal
5771890 if you dont play ball with us well go somewhere else and they do ive seen my business shrink theyre all doing it its hard to stay honest
5771891 faulty and fraudulent appraisals were an important contributor to the losses that the federal government suffered during the saving and loan crisis
5771892 we got to this point by a lack of enforcement the public has the right to expect the appraisal boards are taking care of that problem
5771893 do you know what that would have meant the net effect is it would have effectively shut down mortgage lending in that state
5771894 to take that action would have been an unbelievable disruption to the economy i wasnt going to do that
5771895 either you shut it off completely in a state or you just send letters
5771896 the threat of the atomic bomb is the only thing

5771927 my client is a large investor and while there are small investors who are being squeezed in this process the principles here are simply too important
5771928 we dont want to see small investors hurt in this process any more than is natural
5771929 the pick up in the german zew index in august shows that investors expectations for the economy have improved but this is little consolation given the still low level of the index
5771930 the grimmer view may prompt some players to start speculating about a higher possibility of a rate cut down the road
5771931 but because interest rate differentials between countries are not a trading factor right now such speculation would have little impact
5771932 the fact is that our system compares favourably with others as user friendly
5771933 based on the survey results perhaps canada could be more competitive if we didnt have both retail sales tax and gst systems in these provinces

5771938 warner bros are taking pitches and i dont know when theyre gonna find one that they really like whether its gonna happen next year or the year after but i know that their intention is to do it
5771939 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5771940 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5771941 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5771942 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5771943 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5771944 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labour market is not as strong as it was three years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left

5772008 ive seen van bronckhorst as captain at feyenoord he did fine then and i think thisll be the case with the dutch team as well
5772009 he feels stronger and stronger he had a knee injury but hes recovering very well and has played 90 minutes with inter so he looks good and is confident for the season
5772010 we have henrik larsson as captain tomorrow and i hope we can do quite well
5772011 henrik larsson is still a great player he is probably the best player in the swedish league he is a very strong player
5772012 we all expect a very good match an open game but of course france are a world class nation we are strong at home i think it will be a very tight game

5772024 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5772025 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5772026 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5772027 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5772028 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5772029 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5772030 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue

5772040 father richard rohr is a franciscan of the new mexico province
5772041 you have a need for other people to like and admire you and yet you tend to be critical of yourself while you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them you have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage disciplined and self controlled on the outside you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside at times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing you prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations you also pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others statements without satisfactory proof but you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others at times you are extroverted affable and sociable while at other times you are introverted wary and reserved some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic
5772042 most of the time your energy lifts people up and they love feeding off it but there are times you need someone you can open to and be a source for you to help renew who your are naturally as a person i threw in some nlp by subtlety pointing to myself

5772054 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5772055 is trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5772056 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5772057 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5772058 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5772059 there can be no business as normal under the current circumstances
5772060 this still hasnt happened every day several episodes still occur when our servicemen detain georgian troops
5772061 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5772062 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5772063 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5772064 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5772065 barack obama has been a very strong champion of equal pay for equal work sen mccain over and over again has opposed the opportunity for pay equity bills to move through congress
5772066 but a few years ago i asked some students if they knew what watergate was and they said that was where monica lewinsky lived
5772067 it also prevents students from thinking that the way something is now is the way its always been
5772068 the green bay packers almost always had the same quarterback
5772069 i mean for as long as i can remember brett favre was the man there
5772070 its almost crazy to think he could retire or be with another team
5772071 harry potter could be a classmate playing on their quidditch team
5772072 i wish it was sort of true being on quidditch with him would be kind of cool
5772073 we say join the club it makes us feel old too
5772074 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5772075 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5772076 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5772077 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5772078 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies

5772082 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5772083 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5772084 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5772085 so far its going good we have power and everything its just been windy and rainy
5772086 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day

5772097 father richard rohr is a franciscan of the new mexico province
5772098 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean the shift is permanent
5772099 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
5772100 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
5772101 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences
5772102 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5772103 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5772104 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5772105 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5772106 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5772107 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5772108 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5772109 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5772110 placed its whole case for murder on a 16 year old who had consumed 80 ounces of malt liquor who had a view from a darkened park across a darkened roadway
5772111 is that it were going to hang him on that
5772112 isnt it a little late for you to be out
5772113 we made up a plan that we were going to tell the cops that nobody kicked him that there were no racial slurs there was no booze and brian got hit first
5772114 does exactly what mr ramirez was doing he throws a punch
5772115 its been a really hard day for me and im just really happy that the charges stuck
5772116 by the end of the day if the weather cooperates we can probably get all of our tourists out of there
5772117 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5772118 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5772119 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5772120 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5772121 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5772122 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons

5772124 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5772125 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5772126 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5772127 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5772128 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5772129 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5772130 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5772131 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5772132 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5772133 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5772134 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5772135 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama

5772154 does evil exist and if so do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
5772155 now the one thing that i think is very important is for us to have some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil in the name of good and i think one thing thats very important is having some humility in recognizing that you know just because we think our intentions are good doesnt mean that were going to be doing good

5772165 could not distinguish between every day fruity wines great wines balanced with a full round and long palate and ordinary juice popeyed as they were by the extraordinary use of sugar alcohol and wood
5772166 the problem with an aesthetic based on the principle of might is right is that there will always be someone who can make a wine bigger thus logically laying claim to a higher ranking more to the point these massive wines while undoubtedly impressive and likely to stand out in a line up of 50 100 wines are not and generally never become really drinkable
5772167 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president

5772176 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

5772180 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5772181 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5772182 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5772183 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5772184 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5772185 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5772186 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
5772187 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
5772188 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
5772189 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

5772205 im shocked i knew he would get some prison time but i didnt expect it to be that harsh
5772206 he was the most visible outspoken voice of community activism in l a i had my differences with him but i respected him

5772218 we may be able to find an acceptable way to allow a meaningful compensation for some living unrelated kidney donors without breaching ethical principles or hurting the sensitivities of others
5772219 it is not a good idea to legalize payment for organ donors as such payment institutionalizes the belief that the wealthy ill have property rights to the body parts of the poor
5772220 if monetary incentive makes a potential living donor more willing to save another life what is wrong in allowing that
5772221 rich people have no reason to sell a kidney that is the flaw that is unacceptable in any scheme involving purchasing a kidney its exploitative

5772237 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5772240 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5772241 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

5772243 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself

5772262 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5772263 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5772264 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5772265 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5772266 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5772267 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5772268 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us

5772288 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5772289 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5772290 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate

5772304 in the morning i might just sit up and cry with joy
5772305 the hurdles were just coming up too fast and i just couldnt maintain control so i just crashed and burned
5772306 i was in control for half the race but by the 320m mark i felt my right hamstring i pulled my leg through it and it got tighter and tighter
5772307 you know i didnt mess up once the team did well and backed me up walking away with two medals is just so amazing
5772308 this moment feels better than i thought it ever would because ive gone through a lot of hard times this week
5772309 i fulfilled my dream and it means more to me than anything
5772310 to say that i have five medals at my first olympic games means the world to me
5772311 and just having one gold is ok because it team is the one that means the most
5772312 i used the highest level of difficulty and this is the first time ive used it in a competition
5772313 i was very nervous but i had already won two gold medals team floor in these olympic games so my psychological state was much better than my competitors
5772314 hes so physical trains so hard and is beginning to wrestle with his head hell be around in the years to come
5772315 hes done an unbelievable job of overcoming his background not becoming a victim and making the most from the circumstances hes been given
5772316 ive been in a slump and havent performed since the first two games of the preseason
5772317 i just wanted to make a statement that im back
5772318 weve had some battles with australia and russia over the years we all play against each other in teams together in the states and team in europe
5772319 if someone starts thinking ahead theyre in trouble our next opponent is going to be the most difficult yet
5772320 korea is a good team because they won all their previous games and they pitched well today
5772321 but we tried different pitchers because the final stage is more important than today
5772322 i tried to control my passion during the event and be calm
5772323 this is what i wanted to prove from the preliminary to the final to show all i have
5772324 i wasnt going to be tentative my fifth dive is the only thing that bothered me tonight ive trained really really hard the past four years and its paid off with huge dividends i did everything i could
5772325 when there were three of us at the end i knew the medal was safe but i tried to get the gold
5772326 i kept thinking that this was the moment ive been dreaming of i could hear the other guys breathing and i sprinted and now im the olympic winner
5772327 i fought my way back and i was thinking theres no time like the present said whitfield
5772328 it was a battle of willpower as soon as we came together we had a bit of contact and i knew i had trouble
5772329 we dont think too much about it thats the name of the game
5772330 we dont care about the streak were just focusing on that medal
5772331 the best part of the match for us was the beginning of the second set
5772332 but to win we would have had to be perfect we will be cheering for them walsh and may treanor in the final i hope they win because theyre the best
5772333 it was very hard to focus when my competitors were gaining points on me at the last mark i saw a big puff a the left side of the course and i said to myself i already have a medal so why dont i give it a try i went to the left and moved to the front of the fleet
5772334 i waited to make sure that i got the gold at the end of the day and there was only one way to guarantee it sweden knew it was coming too
5772335 we made some mistakes down the stretch but they are taught to deal with them and they did
5772336 i think its good to get the gold medal but thats not the most important thing
5772337 i just came to enjoy the games to enjoy the olympics and i know the chinese girls have done a very good job and we boys cannot be left behind
5772338 of course this gold is for my wife also my friends my german coach and all the people who have helped me
5772339 but first its for her during the competition i did not think so much about her because i had to stay in the competition but afterwards of course i missed her a lot
5772340 i am happy to hear that i have broke it but i can definitely go faster than that
5772341 it was hard for me to get into it today
5772342 i am pretty happy with how i played i had chances and at the crucial moment i just played too short

5772363 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
5772364 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
5772365 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly

5772403 culver raises taxes and spends more money and wants to use your tax dollars to benefit microsoft
5772404 the determination was made that it did not violate the state campaign laws because it did not expressly advocate for or against gov culver or a clearly identified candidate for office the issue the board is now looking at is whether any of the state lobbying laws were triggered
5772405 it purports to be exempt from tax under section 501 c 4 of the internal revenue code but its notion of promoting the social welfare is to send valentines to electorally troubled republican senate candidates the commission should take immediate steps to enforce the law and expose this groups secret financing to light of day
5772406 an organization that is careful about how it writes the script of its ad can fly under the radar or stay outside of the net of campaign finance activity
5772407 call norm coleman and thank him for his agenda for minnesota
5772408 i think there would be an opening for someone who wanted to prosecute a group who is spending millions of dollars on advertising
5772409 that is evident by the things that are prominently displayed on our web site and in our work

5772413 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
5772414 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
5772415 they told me there are going to be resources here
5772416 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
5772417 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
5772418 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
5772419 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
5772420 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
5772421 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
5772422 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
5772423 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
5772424 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis

5772429 im starting to suspect that the evan bayh boomlet is designed to make tim kaine look better by comparison because really evan bayh is about the only democrat who makes tim kaine look palatable by comparison as obamas veep
5772430 of the people i dont really want to be veep who keep showing up on those fake short lists people keep coming up with he bothers me the least
5772431 personally i still think those significant negatives would make her a terrible pick unfortunately im resigned to obama making a terrible pick with someone else anyway biden bayh kaine so if its between one of those three terrible picks or clinton i throw my hands up in the air
5772432 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5772433 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5772434 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5772435 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5772436 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5772437 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
5772438 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
5772439 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5772440 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5772441 by addressing the connection between the health of our children and the health of the environment we strive to make a difference for both
5772442 to that end naturalpath media is the perfect partner for bringing relevant advertising and sponsorship support that aligns with our values and community at drgreene com

5772445 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5772446 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5772447 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5772448 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5772449 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5772450 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5772451 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5772452 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5772453 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5772454 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5772455 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5772456 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5772457 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5772458 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5772459 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5772460 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5772461 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5772462 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5772463 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5772464 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5772465 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5772466 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5772467 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5772468 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5772469 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5772470 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5772471 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5772472 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5772473 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5772474 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5772475 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5772476 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5772477 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5772478 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5772479 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5772480 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5772481 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper

5772483 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5772484 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5772485 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5772486 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5772487 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5772488 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5772489 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5772490 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5772491 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5772492 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5772493 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5772494 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5772495 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5772496 just so you all know we did set a record
5772497 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5772498 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5772499 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5772500 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5772501 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

5772512 unfortunately the schedule overlaps with another film simon is already committed to
5772513 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

5772518 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5772519 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5772520 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5772521 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5772522 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5772523 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5772524 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5772525 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know

5772540 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5772541 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5772542 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition

5772565 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5772566 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5772567 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5772568 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5772569 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5772570 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5772571 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5772572 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5772573 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5772574 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5772575 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5772576 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5772577 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5772578 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5772579 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5772580 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5772581 during the first quarter of 2008 restructuring plans were developed in response to the shift of the companys business model from traditional physical delivery of our content to digital new media distribution
5772582 with respect to the reorganization of distribution of physical products we have outsourced our dvd distribution in france to a third party and closed down our subsidiary as a result we will make savings of 500 000 euro per year in overheads and we expect sales volumes to increase significantly we are continuing to review our model for distribution of physical products and additional changes are expected
5772583 we do not believe that the revised content strategy will have any impact on sales since our digital new media distribution is mainly dependent on our expansive library and not on new releases unlike the traditional business we also have renegotiated agreements with third parties relating to content acquisition and post production cost
5772584 we do not believe this will have any material impact on sales since we distribute all our magazines together with back catalog dvds and research has indicated that consumers are primarily interested in the dvds
5772585 we expect to continue to focus on cost reductions and expect additional restructuring actions in the near term
5772586 what do you think is the most important legal issue facing the industry this year

5772594 meeting the displayport specification can be challenging when outputting through a notebook docking station for example
5772595 in this application the displayport signal originates from the chipset or gpu on the notebook mother board then travels through pcb traces to the docking connector through more pcb traces in docking station and finally to the displayport connector the 2 7 gbps giga bit per second displayport signal gets quite distorted under these conditions the ps8121ed was specifically designed to alleviate the distortions inherent in long signal transmission traces and it is already being designed into several docking stations we are also finding applications within pc motherboards with displayport integrated into the chipset signal routing to the back panel connector can involve long pcb traces and multiple vias the commonly used fr 4 pcb base material does not propagate these high frequencies very well which results in significant signal loss and distortion the ps8121ed demonstrably improves displayport signal conditioning in multiple applications
5772596 one attractive aspect of displayport is its ease of integration into chipsets and microprocessors
5772597 its relative low signal swing and ac coupling allow it to easily scale with intels most advanced manufacturing processes we are pleased to see technology innovation from companies like parade that will extend the utility of displayport connections to a wider range of applications as docking stations
5772598 pipeline datas management dedicated a substantial amount of time and resources during the second quarter to our expected merger with cocard and the implementation of two significant vendor relationships which will serve to further reduce our processing costs the focus on these initiatives important to the long term growth of the company impeded our progress in furthering our core business objectives during the quarter

5772604 the elevation of responsibilities for jim brings meaningful enhancements to our company
5772605 and we are excited to welcome richard to our management team his experience and expertise will assist mascoma as we move into a period of commercial growth
5772606 the most important thing caregivers can do is to educate themselves on their responsibilities once theyve taken on this role
5772607 its not easy and can be further complicated by the emotional involvement the caregiver often has with the person theyre caring for be it a spouse parent other close relative or friend
5772608 its also important however that caregivers recognize they are not alone and that they seek help when they need it
5772609 inevitably when you begin talking about someones healthcare financial matters come into play so you want to designate someone you can trust who will be able to look at the whole picture
5772610 as a caregiver with power of attorney you are acting on another persons behalf
5772611 you want to make sure that you have a very clear understanding of what the individual you are caring for wants and that you truly are committed to acting in their best interest
5772612 just as you do with your own financial records as a caregiver you want to set up a system so that you can keep track of all the important documents of the individual for whom you are caring remember you really are stepping into their shoes you are responsible for making sure you know where things are and what needs to be done when
5772613 many working adults dont set up monthly budgets so long as the money coming in is far more than the money going out or needed for savings this lack of planning can work
5772614 but when youre dealing with an individual that has a disability that is likely increasing their healthcare costs and keeping them from ever returning to full time work good planning is essential
5772615 two thirds of ssdi applications are rejected and the average time it now takes from initial application through appeals to get an award is two to four years given all the responsibilities a caregiver has getting help from a representative reduces the burden substantially
5772616 while these plans can be costly they can be an essential financial planning component for individuals unable to get any other insurance and facing mounting healthcare costs while awaiting medicare eligibility
5772617 not all medicare plans are created equal and people often opt for the traditional plan thinking its the safe choice but for people with disabilities medicare advantage plans often are the optimal choice you cant be turned away for coverage due to a pre existing condition they usually cost less than a traditional medicare and supplemental plan combined and most medicare advantage plans include prescription drug coverage

5772721 from cnns jessica yellin and ed henry cnn former vice president al gore has accepted a speaking role on the final night of the democratic convention appearing on the same stage that barack obama will officially receive the democratic partys presidential nomination three sources tell cnn it is unclear what gore will say in the speech or at what time he will deliver his remarks before an audience that is expected to exceed 70 000 at invesco field the obama campaign would not comment on the matter
5772722 gore has long stated that he does not want to return to the white house whether as vice president or in another administration role but his statements have not been enough to tamp down the unlikely speculation that he might be tapped as obamas number two the selection of a thursday evening speaking spot should however put the final nail in that coffin vice presidential candidates traditionally address the convention on wednesday night undoubtedly having gore take the stage the same evening as obama pushes a sharp message reminding voters about the fundamental dynamic of this election how different things could have been had george bush not taken the white house in 2000

5772744 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch

5772748 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5772749 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5772750 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5772751 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful

5772760 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5772761 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5772762 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5772763 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5772764 listen im so tired of talking about this stuff it diminishes my whole career and all the hard work i take it as an insult
5772765 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5772766 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5772767 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5772768 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5772769 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5772770 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5772771 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5772772 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5772773 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

5772776 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5772777 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5772778 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5772779 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5772780 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5772781 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5772782 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5772842 ai bimbi rom diamo carezze anziche prenderne le impronte digitali
5772843 ci auguriamo non sia vero il sospetto che in italia stia rinascendo il fascismo sotto altre forme abbiamo definito indecente la proposta del ministro maroni sui bambini rom perch da un lato basta censirli aiutarli a integrarsi con la societ civile in cui vivono marginalizzati ma dallaltro bisogna evitargli la vergogna di vedersi marcati per tutta la vita come membri di un gruppo etnico considerato in potenza tutto esposto alla criminalit quella foto del bimbo ebreo nel ghetto di varsavia con le mani alzate davanti alle ss venuta alla memoria come un simbolo per questo il parlamento di strasburgo e il consiglio europeo hanno protestato

5772845 per un popolo civile non vi nulla di pi vergognoso che lasciarsi governare senza opporre resistenza da una cricca di capi privi di scrupoli e dominati da torbidi istinti

5772847 a hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from the one weve known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle a world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice a world where the strong respect the rights of the weak
5772848 one doesnt feel today as if there is an international official unaffiliated with his countrys national agenda who can be relied upon to be sent into a crisis suss the scene and while not a miracle worker max out on what can be achieved through negotiations through the mobilization of international resources sergio was a hell of a salesman once he got back to capitols etc

5772852 these measures are competitive reasonable and balanced so with this new tax the government will be able to improve education and health services and make investments that will create more jobs in other sectors of the economic and improve livelihoods of zambian citizen
5772853 i do not speak on behalf of government or the chamber of mines in zambia but coupled with the increasing fuel prices the operations of mines will be affected as for the lumwana mine we have not started operations but there are already changes to the development agreements i hope we will stick to the old agreement with government on taxes
5772854 we have put in the largest investment in this project in excess of 800 million to develop this mine the total investment is expected to come up to over 1 billion so you should understand that we are a business
5772855 we have put up a very good management team that is committed to build and develop low carbon emission technology at the mine plant this includes a chemical storage shed and a twin tower laboratory

5772894 who ate the last piece of chicken with white meat bitch
5772895 but i was told a few times that im percy harvin
5772896 on the one hand washington was telling saakashvili to behave not to tempt russia to use force in georgia
5772897 on the other hand the united states was a very close ally of georgia it was training georgian troops georgia had 2 000 soldiers in iraq and i think the closeness of the relationship with the united states did encourage saakashvili to overreach and think that he could get away with more than he could
5772898 i think russia in many respects feels that its really been sort of been treated sort of like a second class citizen relative to the rest of the west
5772899 i think it sees the expansion of nato as a threat to its security it sees the deployment of the u s missile defense system in poland and the czech republic as threats to its security
5772900 so i think in that sense it sees itself as not sitting at the same table as the west
5772901 following this war it will be years before georgia again reaches natos current criteria for new members
5772902 here too we need to change our approach and embrace a country whose survival is at stake too
5772903 these new commitments if undertaken must be backed up by credible military planning and defense arrangements that deter russia
5772904 if you look at this through russian eyes this has not been a partnership with the west this has been the west taking advantage of russian weakness
5772905 and it has created a sense among the russians that the relationship has to be rectified
5772906 the collapse of the soviet union to the current state was a temporary phenomenon that westerners took to be permanent
5772907 it is now changing into something else and the west is stunned by the fact that its not going to stay the way it was
5772908 in joy we live celebrating swami kriyanandas 60 years of discipleship and anandas 40th anniversary

5772913 we hang feather boas from the ceiling and the girls get to be a princess for a day
5772914 we literally generated whole tubs in the lab from scratch
5772915 the beautiful thing is that you start with one line expand them indefinitely and generate as many as you want
5772916 at this stage the work is very promising but has not progressed to the stage where the cultured cells are fully equivalent
5772917 much more work will yet be needed before this becomes a practical reality
5772918 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5772919 its basically a comet but it never gets close enough to the sun to develop a long bright tail of evaporated gas and dust
5772920 if you can find things that explode you can also find things that move but you need different tools to look for them
5772921 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5772922 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5772923 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5772924 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
5772925 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now

5772927 so much of blurbing process is a corrupt quid pro quo

5772930 will not only increase the power supply costs but will double the utility power consumption
5772931 the advanced communication services that voip delivers to our employees and the green solution it offers the environment
5772932 the closer your datacenter is to inexpensive power sources the better for example google is moving its datacenters to the columbia river area to reduce the companys energy costs
5772933 the empire for many people was the major sense of their existence now its no more
5772934 it was regarded as poor retarded you know just underdeveloped and so on
5772935 now under mr putin russia has finally emerged as a more or less well to do nation but it wanted to have the feeling that now it will be regarded by the other nations differently with more respect
5772936 washington has been neglecting the relationship with russia profoundly over the last eight years
5772937 weve had a situation time and time again when president bush has gone to a summit meeting you know declared his cooperation with his good friend president putin and then hes gone back to washington and nothing has happened
5772938 why for 15 years after the end of cold war west did do very little to make russia an ally and friend
5772939 every russian leader came to power saying reasonable things about the west and sooner or later something happens which will turn them anti american
5772940 i talk to my friends they basically say america is extremely selfish country and doesnt understand that other people may have different ideas different agendas different approaches
5772941 they do not trust that this effort undertaken by the u s in europe is against iran or against terrorist launches
5772942 they still think that this is against russia why what is the reason that instead of inviting both nations to cooperate closely they fight each other on that
5772943 all of them are in a stupor because they dont know what to say they dont want to speak out and support russia but on the other hand they dont want to come out and oppose russia
5772944 how many times does obama have to say he is not a muslim
5772945 i actually just looked at it for a while i just held it there and i laid it across my bed and i just stared at it for a few minutes just because as a kid growing up this is the ultimate ultimate in basketball
5772946 it has given us so many great opportunities and its just a sense of pride that you have that you say you know what

5773086 it was a pleasure to sit down with senator mccain and discuss firsthand an issue that is americas top priority ending our dependence on foreign oil which today is approaching 70 percent during the meeting i reiterated the urgency of the situation i told him that any credible domestic energy policy must reduce our foreign dependence on foreign oil by at least 30 in the next 10 years on top of conservation that is beginning to happen must utilize proven and available technologies and be 100 percent comprised of american resources while i can not speak for the senator my sense is that he was interested and encouraged by the work we are doing and recognizes that citizen education and citizen involvement is key to changing course and actually developing a real energy policy with teeth that will help this country from our current disastrous path

5773142 well charlie what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
5773143 this hasnt been triggered by any unsolicited offers its a decision by the shareholders to go and test the market
5773144 if they cant realise the value they will wait and see if these other factors turn in their favour
5773145 others will choose to operate from australia or china kiwi jobs will be lost the connection between tour operators and the country we are meant to be promoting will be broken
5773146 i look forward to seeing it so i can challenge them the ird on that advice
5773147 it makes it very difficult for me to try and work for you if thats the way you want to communicate
5773148 if you have got a debt and someone pays it for you then you should declare that someone had paid it even if you dont know who did
5773149 there is just some pool in which debits and credits seems to float its incredible in the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars both ways and it is very hard to prove anything
5773150 i think it might be of concern to the law society
5773151 is it right for a barrister to receive 100 000 from a third party where there has never been a fee note rendered to the solicitor instructing him i would have thought the law society would have real concerns about that
5773152 i must have timed it to perfection the french guy almost got me on the inside but i saw him up on the big screen coming and i eked out that last inch to dip him on the line
5773153 in my mind its the statue an icon and one people travel far and wide to see and be photographed beside
5773154 unfair because the annual gold guitar festival is really the only time of the year that theres anything going on in gore at all
5773155 even bad things have a good side and who knows how many people will come to cromwell to see just what it is they are talking about
5773156 southland has the kind of new zealand scenery that travellers dream of and postcards fail to capture more than once youre likely to round a corner stop in your tracks and just say oh wow before you reach for the camera
5773157 that was my job today to do a job for the team and cover guys for bevan and kris gemmell shane said after watching docherty receive his medal
5773158 and know i may have played a little part in helping him
5773159 winning a medal was totally in my mind to finish that far back was really discouraging but the whole olympics just being here was amazing but the expatriate kiwi was delighted docherty got a medal
5773160 shane must have done a good job there helping him the new zealand team sat down a week ago to plot strategies
5773161 cover off their key rivals including spanish ace javier gomez who finished fourth and canadas silver medallist simon whitfield
5773162 brotherly love was set aside when the duo compete against each other and he
5773163 matty reed go big guy but her heart was equally with shane in the white suit of new zealand
5773164 i thought it was really good to see shane up ther after the swim because hes always been an excellent swimmer and it was also good to see matt in front on the bike
5773165 and probably catch a few events together with boxing high on the agenda
5773166 there was a dj with speakers as well as an mc who was audible above the music and it could be heard from two doors down the road
5773167 council policy is to ask people to turn music down or reduce the noise we never ask people to turn music off completely
5773168 but he made a tactical error when didnt go with them
5773169 they caught a wind shift and left him behind thats a mistake and hes not feeling very happy about it hes in the container now trying to compose himself for tomorrow
5773170 as long as tom keeps his nerves together he can win and hopefully theyll have stronger breeze than today i really hope he does it
5773171 the win didnt mean too much in the grand scheme of things but it left me wondering what could have been
5773172 this is an exciting new era in healthcare it will free up health professionals time to attend to other patient matters and has the potential to bring huge economic and social benefits for new zealand
5773173 by combining our two countries strengths new zealands software design and koreas strength in robotic technology and production we can build a global market in robotic healthcare for both our countries
5773174 the university of auckland already has expertise in robot programming emotion recognition psychological and clinical evaluation healthcare informatics wireless transmission and speech communication this joint venture will give us the resources and technology we need to commercialise this expertise through robotic production

5773191 it is in keeping with the universitys commitment to exhibit green initiatives it encourages not only practicing personal reduction in driving but doing so in a sustainable fashion

5773201 i want to make sure i get solid information so we can make good judgments
5773202 its an area thats not well understood and its important that we get it right im very concerned about long delays at u s customs inspection stations because this is legal traffic and commerce that benefits the state of texas
5773203 like everyone else who doesnt live here hes seeking information and understanding and thats important
5773204 from what i heard there is no evidence that is happening
5773205 perhaps the utep border center can help us come up with solutions that are more effective
5773206 karl rove is an old friend of mine and hes doing me a favor and im proud to have him here

5773246 i think polls do indicate that the next election in alllikelihood would be a minority one way or the other
5773247 but the fact of the matter is what i will have to decideover the next few weeks is whether or not we can have aproductive fall session of parliament or whether in fact thegovernment a government needs a new mandate
5773248 ensure that one way or another we can have a productive parliament in the future
5773249 if the strike continues into october we could then startto see a significant impact on prices
5773250 from the time i discussed the issue of the partnership withher in june 2007 up till this moment she has remainedsteadfast in the pursuit of its actualisation
5773251 like all other news organizations our business is underfinancial duress
5773252 we are trying toreduce expenses in the least painful way possible
5773253 generally its a pretty unfriendly environment foranything thats not a treasury note
5773254 but in terms of the ultimate credit worthiness ofagencies and their ability and willingness to pay off on alltheir debt obligations that position is stronger now than itwas a year ago
5773255 its a little early in the strike to really assess whatimpact this will have on our commitments to customers
5773256 the bush administration is talking about pumping aid into the damaged georgian economy after that nations short war with russia
5773257 the conflict between georgia and russia was tragic but its time officials in washington stopped treating the treasury department like an atm for the world the deficit rose last month after uncle sam had to bail out several failed banks and the total federal deficit this year is going to run about 400 billion its time to say enough
5773258 the u s spent 21 billion on foreign aid last year not counting money for iraq
5773259 over the years washington has shipped hundreds of billions of dollars overseas with much of it wasted the third world remains poor only with a larger debt indeed u s aid programs often subsidized socialist and undemocratic regimes
5773260 the saakashvili government in georgia made a foolish mistake by initiating hostilities in its breakaway province of south ossetia
5773261 american taxpayers should not have to pay for that mistake after all they already are paying 10 billion a month for the administrations mistaken invasion and occupation of iraq they cannot afford to pay the price for other peoples wars as well
5773262 instead of increasing foreign aid the u s government needs to cut the amount of taxpayer money that it sends overseas
5773263 most important it is time to start saying no more no more international welfare clients no more foreign governments treating america as a cash cow we need to put our own fiscal house in order rather than constantly bail out irresponsible governments around the world
5773264 libertarians hate the government and love a good fight they are absolutely the best friends you can have
5773265 this medal belongs to god he won it i was simply his conduit every five seconds i heard him say jump stevie and by god i jumped if i could hang this medal around gods neck i surely would
5773266 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5773267 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right

5773273 back then james dewar manager of chicagos continental bakery wanted to find another use for his companys shortcake pans he decided to fill the small oblong cakes with a banana cream filling and name them after the twinkle toe shoes he saw advertised on a billboard in st louis banana cream filled twinkies selling two for a nickel debuted as part of the hostess baked goods line during world war ii when there was a banana shortage the filling flavor changed to vanilla
5773274 it tastes like a really dense banana marshmallow between cookies
5773275 these are really delicious i could eat the whole box right now
5773276 the filling really is cremey compress the cookies and it all glorps out normal oreos dont do that
5773277 its got a strong artificial banana smell and taste but its so sugary and smooth these are to bananas what reeses whips are to peanuts
5773278 i might actually like these better than original oreos which scares me a little
5773279 the banana is pretty artificial tasting but the chocolate taste of oreos is also kinda artificial so it works please note artificial tasting does not always equal bad in the case of snack foods
5773280 the banana flavor is nice very artificial but not super heavy
5773281 i cant recall a special flavored oreo thats been bad they do it right
5773282 its like the 99 bananas of oreoes like shitty flavored alcohol you like it at first but the taste gets old after the first 15 minutes and it will give you horrible gut rot the next morning
5773283 its like a softer version of the marshmallow circus peanut sandwiched between chocolatey cookies
5773284 the frosting wont stay put between the cookies it really wants to slide out
5773285 like pizza all banana flavored foodstuffs basically taste the same im not really getting the sundae part it just tastes like creamy artificial bananas
5773286 it tastes like a gummy marshmallow with banana smell somehow coming out of it
5773287 a totally decent variation the kind of specialty candy you could eat during easter without feeling weird about it
5773288 really pretty good but why bother to fuck with it the originals perfect
5773289 you can share this twinkie if you dont want a whole one
5773290 its just a hint of banana in the twinkie the twinkie is way better than the oreos
5773291 uck still not half as bad as half the crap we usually eat
5773292 oreos could learn a thing or two about subtlety from hostess
5773293 twinkies taste like the plastic wrap that vending machine muffins come in this one just tastes like it was used to wrap a banana nut muffin
5773294 i think this is way better than the oreo how is it that a twinkie of all things tastes less artificial than an oreo
5773295 the banana flavor is much less overpowering and thus slightly more organic slightly
5773296 i just imagine some sad individual trying to decide whether to eat a twinkie or some fruit now theres a way to do both kinda thanks hostess
5773297 i imagined a twinkie with mushed up bananas inside but theyve wisely focused the banana flavoring in the cake point the finish is weirdly drier than a proper twinkie however
5773298 whoa it tastes really banana y at first the filling actually tastes like real banana bread
5773299 if you had handed me the twinkie without telling me it was banana i would have thought they just changed the normal filling slightly its not that strongly flavored
5773300 i dont really like twinkies to begin with so im not the best judge but id put these at okay the banana flavor is really really subtle too subtle for my liking i need lots more banana flavor than this to justify eating a whole twinkie
5773301 it tastes like aspartame which is funny because it should taste like animal fat given whats in it
5773302 its very subtle isnt not the right word but it isnt overpowering it has a burning quality to it a sort of chemical harshness in your throat
5773303 its not as good as regular twinkies but its all right
5773304 its so mild that it makes me wonder if theres a little banana flavor in normal twinkies
5773305 basically tastes like a twinkie theres a slight banana taste reminiscent of the pre packaged muffins you get at the counters in convenience stores unfortunately the nuts and bread have been removed in favor of a disgusting white paste leaking out of three holes in the bottom
5773306 hey not bad i was expecting to hate this maybe i like twinkies after all its much less artificial tasting than i expected if you served this at a fancy restaurant in a less recognizable shape i think youd get away with it
5773307 in regards to your inquiry the player who won this weeks tournament leader board did so as he won the most tournament leader board points these points are regardless of what the entry fee is as winning a large cheap tournament is just as hard as winning a large expensive one
5773308 state tax deals clear way for possible 1 100 plus area jobs
5773309 this means 900 new jobs with a payroll of about 40 million to the holland zeeland market
5773310 im very excited for our community which has always been pro business and pro expansion
5773311 our major industries are doing well but more good paying jobs are always welcome
5773312 its been a long day today but weve found some important improvements in a few different areas so its been worthwhile and i am leaving here feeling very happy weve worked on electronics and it seems weve found some improvements under accelleration then of course weve worked a lot with bridgestone on both front and rear tyres weve definitely found some good things in this area as well helping our agility and stability in the corners and we are faster with these new tyres its been a good test and now we are looking forward to the final six battles
5773313 weve had a full couple of days testing and everyone has worked very hard with great results this is probably our last test of the season so its been very important for us to have this chance to check many small things especially tyres electronics and setting we have had a long week here in brno but both the race and the test have been very successful and now were looking forward to misano
5773314 im really happy with how these two days have gone
5773315 today we started out well on the first run then we made a few changes that didnt really improve the setting that we had for the race so we decided to end the test early we did a good job yesterday and found the right path to follow which should allow us to use a softer tyre in future and seems to be more suited to my riding style i did well at misano last year and i cant wait to race there again
5773316 ok so this will be sort of pain in the ass but all sewing is to some degree and once you get past the little doohickey on the collar it will be relatively straightforward
5773317 there is always someone family members would like to be present that because of work schedules and travel issues are unable to be there

5773330 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5773331 removal of the guarantee of hours will not only penalize mechanics and cleaners but will also further create an atmosphere of favouritism when they management distribute work

5773342 was to discuss windows performance and or just make windows faster theres a lot to this topic so we expect to talk about this quite a bit over the next months
5773343 vista really is a dog compared to xp performance wise and compatibility wise yes it is prettier and it has the search facility but its uac networking and compatibility just sux i always turn uac off it is so annoying for overall compatibility and speed xp is still the gold standard for me i truly hope microsoft listens to its customers and makes windows 7 everything vista should have been faster as compatible hardware and software and easier to use than xp hey and dump the drm bloat too your customers dont need it
5773344 ill probably post this multiple times until it gets noticed but i really think windows 7 needs to be a super efficient core with plug in style features that way as a gamer or just someone who needs all the speed he can get i can just run windows barebones with only the applications i need
5773345 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems
5773346 at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds clichy but i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5773347 i like the idea a stripped down version of windows 7 just the basics no pretty fluff no bloat and hardware requirements way below that of the full blown bloatdows 7 of course the price would be significantly lower as well ahhh lovely dream wont happen

5773449 la selecci n brasile a dio adi s al sue o ol mpico pero en esta oportunidad la eliminaci n fue m s dolorosa la derrota fue ante argentina que gole por 3 0 y se clasific para la final

5773451 el sue o de conquistar la in dita medalla de oro en los juegos ol mpicos acab para la selecci n brasile a en toda la historia ol mpica brasil jam s consigui subir al lugar m s alto del podio con su equipo de f tbol
5773452 el sue o de oro ol mpico acab por lo menos otros cuatro a os jugando defensivamente y sin opciones de ataque brasil perdi frente a su rival argentina y qued por fuera de la final ol mpica
5773453 adem s de no conquistar el oro la selecci n vuelve a ser el centro de cr ticas por parte de la prensa brasile a principalmente el t cnico dunga que tendr dificultades para mantenerse en el cargo en caso de que fracase en los pr ximos partidos por las eliminatorias mundialistas

5773455 quien fue al estadio a ver el duelo entre messi y ronaldinho termin viendo al yerno de maradona brillar ag ero el equipo de dunga perdi la cabeza al final del juego y tuvo dos jugadores expulsados por faltas violentas
5773456 no es f cil ganar de esta manera a brasil
5773457 esto despu s de un mundial es para nosotros lo m s importante es un torneo que lo mira todo el mundo y tenemos que aprovechar para ganar otra medalla de oro
5773458 hay mucha diferencia con el torneo de atenas aqu hay jugadores diferentes y rivales diferentes hemos pasado por situaciones dif ciles pero lo hemos conseguido y estamos en la final
5773459 la gente hoy hablaba de un duelo rinaldinho messi pero lo m s importante era que argentina ganara y ha ganado

5773464 argentina jug hoy con mucha inteligencia y personalidad sab amos que brasil pod a optar por esperarnos y nosotros ten amos que tener paciencia y no apurarnos a la hora de atacar creo que les ahogamos en todo momento

5773470 da la sensaci n de que este periodo le ha hecho alejarse todav a m s de la realidad del pa s vasco
5773471 es evidente afirm que la consulta no es ni de lejos ninguno de los problemas que afecta a la ciudadan a europea ni va a estar nunca en su agenda porque no es algo que preocupe a sus ciudadanos
5773472 o bien no vive en el mundo en el que vivimos
5773473 este lehendakari no sirve para el inter s de los ciudadanos vascos porque vive en un mundo distinto
5773474 es m s que urgente su relevo porque est claro que no conoce ni sabe ni entiende ni quiere asumir los verdaderos problemas de la ciudadn a vasca que desede luego no son ni la consulta ni el supuesto derecho a decidir
5773475 ni ninguno de los pa ses que la componen tienen entre sus prioridades nada que tenga que ver con ese supuesto derecho a la consulta y las enso aciones de su lehendakari
5773476 y si realmente se cree lo que dice es una muestra m s de que sus prioridades est n cada vez m s alejadas de la ciudadan a vasca y europea
5773477 r esulta dif cil para un lehendakari dar la opini n sobre un tripartito que cada vez est m s claramente en fase de desintegraci n
5773478 el propio lehendakari exhibe otra diferente y su partido otra distinta
5773479 en ese absoluto carajal en clara fase de descomposici n la mejor manera de no afrontar el problema es no contestar y esconder la cabeza debajo del ala

5773494 inflation accelerated to 27 in july overtaking sri lanka as the fastest rate in asia
5773495 wal mart the worlds largest retailer said its july sales at u s stores open at least a year or same store sales rose 3 percent
5773496 the consumer price index was up 5 6 year over year in the latest report
5773497 fair to say that sales actually slumped 2 6 this month at wal mart in real purchasing power but wait there is more also noteworthy is the fact that the three main items that consumers go to wal mart for are groceries flat screen television sets and gasoline considering that prices in energy rose 34 7 and food rose by 6 6 this report is borderline disastrous
5773498 companies throughout the food chain are changing the way they do business in response to soaring grain costs and consumers are likely to bear the brunt in the form of rising food prices
5773499 farmers are making the broadest cuts to their livestock herds in decades meaning meat at the supermarket will likely cost more in coming years
5773500 since 1980 per capita meat consumption in china has nearly tripled the price of pork has jumped more than 50 in one year yet the butcher shops remain packed
5773501 the chinese eat more pork than the rest of the world combined the country consumes seven times as much as the number two consumer the united states and consumption is increasing according to the usda chinese pork consumption rose 22 between 2002 and 2006
5773502 resulted in a 9 decline in chinese pork production chinese pork prices rose 68 between april 2007 and april 2008
5773503 the potential for further chinese importation of pork is almost incomprehensible
5773504 middlemen are trying to shorten the duration of supply contracts to 90 days from one year so they can pass on higher costs more quickly and food brands are shrinking the contents of their packages from ice cream cartons to beverage containers

5773506 het lijkt erop dat in vele gevallen de belangrijkste reden voor de verliezen van de banken in de kredietcrisis het onvermogen was om risicomanagement en interne controlesystemen met elkaar in verband te brengen en op elkaar af te stemmen essenti le schakels ontbreken vaak in de drie eenheid risk governance and control
5773507 het juist de interne beheersingssystemen die steeds meer bepalen wie de winnaars en de verliezers zijn in de mondiale financi le sector
5773508 governance risicomanagement en interne controle zijn de belangrijkste uitdagingen voor financi le instellingen op dit moment naarmate de lat voor interne beheersing en compliance met wet en regelgeving steeds hoger komt te liggen moet de raad van bestuur aan de verschillende toezichthouders kunnen bewijzen dat zij in control zijn

5773532 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
5773533 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
5773534 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
5773535 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
5773536 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
5773537 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer

5773554 having run off a long string of wins after hooking up with tachi palace and goossen tutor i feel i am improving with every fight they put me in
5773555 i am doing well in sparring sessions with world class fighters like malik scott which has given me tremendous confidence the beginning of my career i was just going through the motions at times and the main reason for my losses with my team intact now all ive done is concentrate on fighting
5773556 a win at tachi on august 21 and perhaps one or two more before the year is out should position me to move up the rankings
5773557 i have a strong feeling that 2009 is going to be a big year for me as i work toward my goal of becoming heavyweight champion of the world
5773558 ive seen the improvement and gains manuel has made for the past few years and in 2009 well get him his opportunity to take it to the next level

5773563 the offer to top rank for the williams margarito rematch is quite simple
5773564 when margarito said he wanted a rematch right after our fight on july 14th i said i was happy to give him one so of course id be just as happy to give him a rematch in november
5773565 his promoter knows that if me and margarito get in the ring again i would win they know i know how to fight him and im as tough of course he has a chance to upset me but the chance is slim
5773566 im sure margaritos fans want to see him redeem himself against williams
5773567 and i know fans of paul williams want to see him put margarito in his place again while unifying the wbo and wba welterweight titles
5773568 for this fight its winner take all in my eyes our sport thrives with compelling fights and its hard to imagine that their second fight would be better than the first but i believe it would break all records for actual number of big time punches thrown in a fight
5773569 im top heavy so its easy for me to get down to 147 when i start training i walk around about 160 so i can go up and down between 147 and 168
5773570 i just want to fight i want to fight people who are on the same level with me or on a higher level than me in their mind my fans always tell me they love that about me
5773571 if i wanted you dead i would have already killed you

5773620 vamos dar seq ncia ao nosso trabalho a derrota acarreta press o mas temos que continuar este o momento de termos frieza
5773621 jogamos como sempre mas nem sempre as coisas saem como a gente espera nem sempre se consegue marcar o gol
5773622 se eu que n o entendo nada de futebol tenho consci ncia total da import ncia de um evento como a copa do mundo imagine para o presidente que maluco pelo esporte para ele prioridade absoluta temos que investir pesado n o s pela copa mas pelas car ncias da cidade
5773623 quando fui prefeita 2001 a 2004 quis trazer a olimp ada de 2012 para c mas perdemos a disputa na verdade foi a pr via para o rio de janeiro agora espero que possamos concorrer novamente por 2016 pois temos condi es de ganhar
5773624 n o podemos dar o passo maior do que a perna
5773625 a copa do mundo ouro para n s pois j nossa quando fui ministra da cultura enviei um estudo de mobilidade urbana ao presidente e ele foi aprovado nele constam a constru o de 63 quil metros de metr e 289 quil metros de corredores de nibus al m de um trem bala ligando campinas guarulhos e s o paulo ao custo de r 15 bilh es isso responde solu o dos problemas at 2014
5773626 quando os jogadores v m de tr s fico apenas com um marcador como seu grande quase sempre consigo virar para cima do zagueiro
5773627 assim consigo fazer esse papel de gar om tamb m dando bons passes para os companheiros
5773628 sou muito pouco usado nessa fun o de piv aqui no fluminense j falei v rias vezes para os meias jogarem mais a bola em mim
5773629 o time est mais r pido o vald via pede bastante a bola um jogador muito habilidoso como geralmente recebe a falta amarra um pouco o jogo
5773630 o estilo n o vai mudar estamos mantendo o padr o muda a caracter stica de alguns na sua fun o quem est jogando tem o objetivo de chegar com mais velocidade surpreender no passe r pido tentamos suprir a aus ncia do vald via com mais objetividade soltando a bola mais r pido fazendo um dois e finalizando mais
5773631 n o fica mais f cil porque o vald via diferenciado tem muita qualidade como ele muito talentoso tinha bastante vantagem no confronto de um contra um e isso ajudava j que ele n o faz mais parte do grupo a gente sabe que tem mais espa o no contra ataque jogando fora de casa e pode ter vantagem na sa da de bola mais r pida na liga o direta com o ataque
5773632 a decep o muito grande n o conseguimos o objetivo maior mas vamos conversar um tentar animar o outro eu como o mais velho quero tentar animar o resto do pessoal para disputar o bronze
5773633 na sele o brasileira seria mais importante entrar na hist ria ganhando o ouro e agora temos que pensar nesse objetivo que temos na m o
5773634 foi um jogo bem disputado mas sofremos gol no segundo tempo tentamos dar o troco mas a bola pegou no poste na cobran a de falta do pr prio ronaldinho dormimos em alguns instantes e eles aproveitaram
5773635 a gente procurou fazer o m ximo saio com o sentimento de que fiz o meu melhor
5773636 desejava muito essa medalha mas me recupero r pido as coisas deram erradas e agora n o tem mais como voltar atr s se tivesse feito algo errado estaria mais arrependido
5773637 sou uma pessoa muito tranq ila n o sou de demonstrar mas estou feliz e calmo por dentro estou muito contente por esta vit ria especialmente contra quem foi mas n s sabemos que viemos para c com um objetivo e agora precisamos estar tranq ilos para pensarmos na final
5773638 a nig ria tamb m uma equipe dif cil temos que ter claro em nossa cabe a que estamos a apenas um passo da medalha de ouro conquistamos algo muito importante e n o apenas pelo resultado tudo bem o 3 a 0 mas termos que ressaltar o funcionamento e a entrega do time antes de mais nada todos aqui jogam e s o solid rios com os companheiros e isto o mais importante
5773639 ag ero um grande jogador talvez n o viesse jogando o que sabe mas banquei sua escala o porque sabia que ele pode definir uma partida a qualquer momento ele acordou hoje e estou muito contente porque ele trabalhou por isso e merecia fez dois gols dentro de campo e deixou tudo o que tinha dentro de campo e isso fundamental
5773640 um cargo que demanda muito tempo e quem quer ser candidato deve medir se d realmente para conciliar a vida pessoal com a de presidente do botafogo conversei com o rotenberg e com o jo o pedro e n o quero atrapalhar a vida pol tica do clube estamos a noventa dias da elei o e temos prazos a serem respeitados hoje n o sou candidato e estou apenas avaliando essa possibilidade
5773641 ser candidato a presid ncia do botafogo uma vontade de todo botafoguense estive presente no clube esses ltimos anos e sei que esse cargo exige entrega total n o consigo fazer uma coisa sem me dedicar com a intensidade que ela exige para fazer as coisas a meia bomba prefiro n o fazer
5773642 cheguei ao botafogo em 2003 para ajudar a informatizar o clube que a rea que eu entendo ao longo desse per odo existiram alguns desgastes naturais de qualquer rela o por isso resolvi me afastar no ano passado quando me aproximei foi para ajudar e quando senti que n o era mais poss vel me distanciei por m continuo torcendo pelo botafogo mesmo de longe

5773646 sinofresh r nasal spray used three times daily appeared to effectively eliminate mrsa in the noses of the test animals while leaving enough normal microbes to keep a normal population in the nasal passages
5773647 since bacteria can in effect change their metabolism to be resistant to antibiotics but cant very well change the laws of physics the chances for development of resistance to sinofresh r nasal sprays mode of killing them is much lower said dr todhunter
5773648 these results have exceeded our expectations the positive results of this in vivo study gives us the solid scientific platform we have needed in order to advance our efforts to fight mrsa to the next level
5773649 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean the shift is permanent
5773650 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
5773651 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
5773652 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences

5773664 the device was an old type of device that had been used previously in the ira campaign and we believe at this point in time it had probably been stored since then and malfunctioned possibly because it hadnt been stored in very good conditions
5773665 if theres one bit of semtex there is an indication theres more out there and thats very worrying
5773666 we assure you that we will do our best to be the voice of africa along with african nations on the security council babacan said
5773667 during the night iraqi forces from baghdad burst into the provincial council building
5773668 they were hitting everyone they disarmed the guards and killed my secretary abbas al timini
5773669 we call on the government and judicial authorities to ensure the protection of prisoners to punish torturers and not to include them on amnesty lists
5773670 its true that there is no specific law but they torturers could be charged for voluntary blows and injuries
5773671 the culprits are being investigated but this type of case takes time
5773672 and threatened to cut the supply of oil via the oil pipeline and gas through the camisea gas pipeline
5773673 the indians have told us they are not afraid if the government declares a state of emergency they prefer to die there and show that this government violates human rights

5773676 we have got to help we have got a voice that kids listen to it is unfortunate it is part of life part of culture these days and this is why we want to get involved we want to make a change
5773677 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5773678 in mexico authorities dont care about kidnappers or the families of kidnap victims they never do anything
5773679 why do i continue because i think that any mother who has her son stolen from her has to look for him
5773680 they say that in mexico theres a kidnapping for every level of society
5773681 today in 70 or 80 percent of cases police or ex police belong to kidnapping groups in mexico city
5773682 it is with deep sorrow that i have to tell the people of zambia that our president has passed away this morning

5773688 the nato russia council meetings would be placed on hold until russia adhered to the ceasefire and the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to abide by the peace plan
5773689 we cannot continue with business as usual as long as russia does not commit to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5773690 i think its the most beautiful performance in the world

5773692 in terms of results to resources ratio its no contest bang for buck
5773693 if you gave the arirang organizers us 300 million to put on one show id imagine something vastly more impressive than the beijing opening ceremonies
5773694 when they heard the gunshots they tried to go up the stairs but they were hit by gunfire
5773695 my child was also hit in the neck and was taken to a hospital but hes with me now
5773696 we havent had any sleep we deployed near the highway and the perimeter of the town so they could not enter again
5773697 we are now looking at certain major cities and towns that are vulnerable and possible targets and we are right now in the process of securing these places
5773698 this years percentage of summer days with bad air quality is about half of that of the past five summers
5773699 we have hypothesized that there are three main reasons the air is good this summer heavier rainfall less impact on the atmosphere induced by typhoons and less air pollutants from traffic
5773700 however though this year taiwan suffered from typhoons kalmaegi and fung wong they did not affect the air quality much
5773701 from data we gathered from the bureau of energy as well as the media we concluded that the cleanliness of the air was related to fewer people driving a result of higher gas prices
5773702 for example traffic flow on national freeways this june dropped by 8 percent compared with the same period last year
5773703 you sense a tougher environment a more restricted environment a more pessimistic environment its a moment of turmoil i think
5773704 the government seems confused how to deal with the difficulties and they have been making some mistakes in running the economy
5773705 some people who have been moving from rural areas to seek jobs in industrial zones are deciding that it is not worth it and people are moving home
5773706 we make these beautiful things but the prices have gone up and fewer people are buying them its not just us though its the whole country
5773707 the situation is moving in a positive manner the tension is now being cooled down
5773708 the situation has improved quite a lot in regards to the standoff between the militaries from both sides
5773709 the tension around the area has been eased we hope very much that the situation will go back to normal as soon as possible
5773710 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5773711 we certainly have not the intention to close all doors
5773712 russian troops will have to withdraw now to their pre crisis positions
5773713 will be deployed immediately to the area adjacent to south ossetia
5773714 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5773715 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5773716 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5773717 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5773718 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5773719 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5773720 llamadlo como quer is no s ni c mo llamarlo
5773721 ahora mismo trago por un cent metro el que le dej fuera de los tres ltimos tiros qu le voy a hacer puedo decir muchas cosas malas de m mismo pero voy a decir las buenas

5773729 es la primera vez que estoy en la final entre los cinco primeros ahora tengo que mejorar la ansiedad hago entrenamientos espectaculares y luego una de las cosas que me mata es no estar estar bien en los momentos clave
5773730 it is not surprising that medtronic would attempt to intimidate nuvasive with this suit since nuvasive represents a growing threat to medtronics spine business medtronic did not notify us of the lawsuit prior to filing it and has not been in contact with us yet we have obtained a copy of the complaint and are in the process of reviewing it and assessing our defenses based on our initial review we do not expect our existing operations to be significantly disrupted as we respond to this lawsuit given the existing patents referenced by medtronic in the complaint we are also analyzing our potential counterclaims based on our own significant patent portfolio and intellectual property rights
5773731 we would prefer to compete with medtronic in the market but we are prepared to defend ourselves in the courtroom so that patients can continue to experience the innovations that nuvasive has brought to the field of spinal care the timing of this lawsuit is strange given the fact the allegedly infringing products in some instances have been on the market for several years nonetheless we will vigorously defend ourselves in this action more importantly we will stay focused on building our business and remaining a leader in the development of creative spine surgery products that benefit patients
5773732 the court believes that more than a thousand voters were bribed during tsais 2006 election campaign
5773733 as a result his elected status ought to be annulled
5773734 its unreasonable that the court find me guilty simply because of one or two witnesses comments
5773735 we are coming here to submit a letter to the british government asking them to return thaksin to receive justice in thailand
5773736 thaksin fled the indictment to london and is planning to seek asylum in britain
5773737 if thaksin is not brought back to face the charges against him in thai courts it will further contribute to the political and democratic deadlock
5773738 extradition requests are decided in strict accordance with the law
5773739 thaksin is not a political refugee but a criminal evading an arrest warrant
5773740 i did nothing wrong because i never named anyone when making the accusation
5773741 we simply made reasonable speculation on the case so it is not slander
5773742 it was former president lee teng hui who decided to buy the lafayette frigates not me also i had been retired for more than two years when former navy captain yin ching feng was killed so i had nothing to do with this
5773743 since the defendants could not provide sufficient evidence to prove their speculation that is slander
5773744 a whole bunch of ministers at the top a whole bunch of soldiers at the bottom and nothing in between
5773745 local government is where the actual governance is its more realistic its more sustainable and its more secure
5773746 kill me and you will suffer the wrath of my entire clan
5773747 you cant start from the top down thats a waste of energy
5773748 you have to start from the grass roots people dont trust each other you start small and when people see that its working they will want to join
5773749 ideally bottom up is very good for somalia but the problem is the warlords to make any government work they have to be included in some way
5773750 laudatory effort to ensure that front line agents are given clear rules to follow in pursuit of their investigations
5773751 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters
5773752 the important aims of the guidelines and their potential implications for civil liberties require a meaningful dialogue between congress and doj
5773753 we continue to discuss this with congress and we are carefully reviewing the suggestions we have received from these discussions
5773754 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5773755 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5773756 i remember seeing nastia have hers from the all around and it is so pretty silver is really pretty too
5773757 three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5773758 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5773759 if that was a us brigade it would not have gone into combat
5773760 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5773761 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5773762 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5773763 the soul that does not listen to that prophet will be completely destroyed from amoung the people
5773764 mccain views this as the one decision that he has total utter nonnegotiable control over
5773765 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy
5773766 there is no historic and religious document that says kumari should be denied their child rights guaranteed in the un convention on the rights of the child
5773767 there should be no bar on kumari from going to school and enjoying health related rights
5773768 the kumaris should not be treated as bonded laborers and restrictions on free movement should not be imposed
5773769 a directive order has been issued to the government to provide basic human rights including education and health care to the child
5773770 this means the childs rights cant be violated in the name of culture
5773771 throughout his long career congressman allen has supported fairness and equality while opposing discrimination his voting record on lgbt issues is exceptional he has worked to eliminate discrimination in jobs housing public accommodations and financial matters and we look forward to working with him to win fully inclusive federal employment non discrimination legislation
5773772 although the figure showed the respondents attitude to the government in general the chinese nationalist party kmt administration should pay attention because this also means its satisfaction rate has hit a new low
5773773 but how will i know that i really do not need to know about it it might not be valuable information to me at this very moment but perhaps one day i might be in need of knowing about it
5773774 i knew i had trained very well but these guys who were with me at the front were really the big guys
5773775 i just tried to execute my own race as simon went i knew it was going to be tough i just had to bite and fight
5773776 this year ive lost all my races on sprints it teaches you a lesson and ive learned at the right time i guess
5773777 i gave it all i had and jan just kept coming
5773778 i was a little bit nervous with just those four guys there but it depends how much you want it
5773779 i didnt get it but sport is like that its not mathematics
5773780 i gave it everything i had to give i tried to charge in the third lap but it wasnt enough i had nothing more to do
5773781 a mans health can be judged by which he takes two at a time pills or stairs
5773782 if russia threatens poland then we poles have the right to feel threatened
5773783 but this type of statement from russian generals is a problem for all of nato and i expect the alliance to take a stand on this

5773788 i am not obliged to disclose any details regarding the investigation we already asked the office to give a full report as soon as possible
5773789 he liu could have sent it via dhl or fedex he could have also informed the ministry right away through our secured fax line and telegram system
5773790 one of humanitys great conquests is the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are new and worrying examples of this in various countries often linked to social and economic problems that nonetheless can never justify contempt or racial discrimination

5773792 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services

5773834 i finished off the olympic games with to me the most perfect ending ever
5773835 to finally get the gold medal on my very last routine meant the world to me
5773836 we went out there and showed we are the best going 1 2 in the all around thats never been done by the united states the americans have never had 1 2 on beam before either and 2 3 on floor isnt too bad
5773837 four years ago we had a large failure and we blamed ourselves
5773838 i would never trade one of my silvers for gold
5773839 what i went through to get them is very special to me and really touched my heart
5773840 she came in with the possibility of winning a few gold medals and that hasnt happened we were running out of chances
5773841 i knew it wasnt quite my best routine but i knew it was enough for a medal but im really happy for shawn three silvers is kind of hard to take i couldnt be more proud of her
5773842 thats the great ending she was a little bit disappointed after the all around but she went all the way to the end i can appreciate that
5773843 to finally have a gold and be an olympic gold medalist its what everyone dreams of
5773844 i hit the floor and i looked at mark and said can you believe that just happened
5773845 you cant be upset with two medals at my first olympics

5773853 it seems that because bodily asymmetries are too subtle to be seen with the naked eye evolution has instead engineered more conspicuous signals and displays such as broad shoulders curvy waist lines or smooth dance moves to indicate mate quality
5773854 the 3d body scanner accurately extracts hundreds of measurements of the human body including volume in six seconds and removes a potential source of measurement error the human experimenter
5773855 it is widely believed that human beings are attracted to one another as a result of genotypic and phenotypic quality in other words their prospect as a mate who will yield higher quality offspring for the chooser
5773856 my previous research suggested that bodily symmetry is not necessarily what people attend to when they find someone attractive but nonetheless the physical cues that they do prefer may reveal an individuals underlying developmental quality i e degree of symmetry this new research identifies an explanation for the correlation between bodily shape and attractiveness your body proportions shape and stature are signals that conspicuously advertise your good development or health and therefore the degree to which you are a desirable reproductive partner in many species fewer departures from perfect symmetry are associated with good development health and reproductive success

5773858 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5773859 global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the world economy particularly the us economy
5773860 while growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase
5773861 is expected to be somewhat higher over the coming months but to moderate gradually thereafter
5773862 thus it is likely that the economy will return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability
5773863 today the stock markets performance was better than expected and it is likely to spur investors confidence

5773869 the ecb is certainly concerned about inflation but that doesnt mean that theyll raise interest rates given the deteriorating economic environment
5773870 is something which is ongoing and undoubtedly creates more risks
5773871 this should be the peak in producer price inflation but its too early for the ecb to sound the all clear
5773872 the bank is still concerned about the pass through of previous price increases and will stay on hold for the foreseeable future

5773895 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5773896 i think there is little question that the domestic automakers are somewhat strapped for resources and they have to go out and borrow money and stuff like that
5773897 whenever they have to do that it is difficult to come up with the same level of quality and the same level of customer satisfaction
5773898 it was a difficult decision but i want to recover in time for the us open
5773899 i am playing with great confidence it could not have come at a better time
5773900 it took me like more than 30 hours to get here but being part of the australian olympic team was just amazing i met so many athletes its a memory i will embrace forever
5773901 i thought this is brilliant it implies all this power and protection and strength right off the bat
5773902 its not a new product its not new technology they turned what was a niche market they took the undergarment your under sports apparel into something you actually wanted to wear
5773903 they connect better with the consumer than any brand weve seen in a decade
5773904 im really struck by the concept of home protection in their ads
5773905 in one theres this coach yelling at his team nobody comes here and beats us at our game in our house but i am looking at it through the lens of 9 11 at the anxiety and shame that in fact they did come here and did not play our game and beat us in our house
5773906 the best letter i ever got was from a seal serving in iraq
5773907 he said i just want to thank you this stuff makes 120 degrees feel like 110
5773908 i just saw someone walking down the street in las vegas wearing a long sleeve under armour shirt
5773909 it was 100 degrees out and i asked him why he was wearing it he said i love it it makes me feel like i just worked out and how do we say this this guy didnt look like he had been lifting weights any time recently
5773910 even if i say to them if we get the cheaper brand you can have two they say no id rather have just one
5773911 id love to see the brand images of under armour go head to head with abercrombie
5773912 i think under armour would crush them but you know id rather own the shirt from abercrombie
5773913 arsenal can today confirm that togolese forward emmanuel adebayor has signed a new long term contract with the club
5773914 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and he is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him
5773915 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and there was manipulation from agents on both sides but overall i am positive he will recover
5773916 please give me all of your strength we can face yesterdays mistakes
5773917 when the sun comes out again there will still be good weather
5773918 if the charge sticks then he will be thrown out of the sumo association
5773919 owais is going to bat at no 3 for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at no 7
5773920 hes a high scoring quick scoring cricket player who plays cricket shots to get boundaries and i think down the order he was wasted when he has played for us hes always done really well he got a one day hundred against india last year and has got runs this year and i am going to give him the confidence to bat at number three with myself at number four
5773921 i havent thought about the twenty20 side yet but theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5773922 physically im tired three matches in a week its not easy with a return like that as well i hurt my adductors
5773923 where can i find funding or investment for my ideas projects teams or company
5773924 the prophet said if my ummah bears fifteen traits tribulation will befall it someone asked what are they o messenger of allah he said
5773925 just the other day i was standing in line at the grocery store and there was a guy next to me thats all he wanted to talk about we cant get away from it everywhere we go everybody wants to talk about kentucky
5773926 were putting down big south logos on our floor instead of the atlantic sun logos
5773927 last season we tried to play as many big south schools as we could play so we could get a feel for the league we tried to get as much tape on those teams as we could get our hands on this move is going to be hard and it might take a few years for us to get settled but were doing as much as we can to prepare
5773928 im looking forward to playing those guys twice every year
5773929 they give us a goal to shoot for winthrop is definitely the team to beat until somebody can top them on a consistent basis theyre going to be the kings of the court in the big south and they ought to be they deserve it theyve been beyond spectacular
5773930 but they have six of their top seven leading scorers coming back i know that what they try to do is try and spread you out defensively and they really rely heavily on their ability to shoot the 3
5773931 as for getting his rebounds back i dont know yet but the good news is that every one of our returning guys wanted to come back to campus early we havent had that problem in a long time usually they wait until the last minute and take as long as they can
5773932 theyll remember presbyterian coming in here theyll remember high point unc asheville all those people theyll be fired up
5773933 were a team thats been built on our ability to guard
5773934 thats not going to change thats our primary staple were going to work hard at it every single day because thats what were all about
5773935 i think at his time hes in the best physical health hes been in since he was high school
5773936 bigger stronger more mature as well going into the season we can have the best possible outlook about what to expect from kenny right now im very optimistic
5773937 we get great community support and our fans help make it a very tough place to play and now we have nine guaranteed home games per year from the big south
5773938 lo nico que tenemos nosotros son concesiones con las aerol neas y en el caso de aeropostal lo que se est haciendo es sincerar un contrato con respecto a las reas aeropostal sigue trabajando
5773939 i think there were decisions made in years past to build other parts of the beltway and there was probably some good reason for that but now that its been constructed theres not a good reason not to open it to the public
5773940 i think sometimes our job is difficult but what were supposed to do is whats in the public interest this would benefit the community and we spent significant public dollars and we need to finish the job
5773941 im being followed by the paparazzi and its extremely dangerous

5774000 i have never let my schooling interfere with my education
5774001 one of my goals was to have an up sounding bunch of music
5774002 i wanted the music to be sophisticated yet accessible i also wanted the lyrics to be personally meaningful to make sure i was getting out what was in my heart
5774003 but then it got to be an exciting time soon after because i learned that choosing a particular door opens up all these other doorways thats what the song is about
5774004 all these people were calling me up to play bass
5774005 but i decided to work on songwriting and hire myself as bass player
5774006 i was like now im going to take the ball and run with it lyrically i wanted this excited feeling of flying through the air to come through
5774007 she leapt like a frog but got caught by the green sparrow
5774008 i lived in a tucked away rural neighborhood that was like a fairyland
5774009 thats like another bonus its going to be exciting adts obviously been a great sponsor for us over the years so something to keep in mind and work even harder for
5774010 i thought after the first few holes it was going to be a great round but then a few missed putts and it was tough
5774011 it was a battle out there today i am so happy to win but wish i could have played a little better
5774012 i stopped that 64 degree wedge on the last hole a dime pretty much thank goodness i had that club in my bag
5774013 then after jordan and i both missed putts on the first playoff hole i made a putt on the second to win
5774014 i struggled coming down the back nine but pulled it out in the end when it mattered
5774015 all i wanted to do coming here was make the junior ryder cup and i did that
5774016 i played a consistent round with no bogeys and that is definitely what i wanted to do i would have liked for a couple of more putts to drop and i left a couple short too
5774017 this is the biggest tournament that i have ever won
5774018 it is especially good because i was in the lead all four days i am usually coming from behind when i win so it is nice to win when i have been in front of everyone else
5774019 i was telling myself to be patient all day and the putts finally started dropping and i extended the lead
5774020 i came here to get into the junior ryder cup winning the junior pga championship was a huge bonus
5774021 i struck the ball well all week and saved myself from having to make a lot of up and downs
5774022 im really shocked right now because i really didnt play like i was going to win today
5774023 i wasnt hitting many greens but i really believed in my short putting

5774265 they have worked and will continue to work together on ending the war and protecting civil liberties however ron wants to substantially cut the size and scope of the federal government there are too many differences on issues such as taxes and spending to think a joint ticket would be possible
5774266 the pre civil war south was the most harmonious society with racial mixing in history
5774267 if creationism is so scientifically unimportant then why do scientists spend so much time fighting them
5774268 a piece with no factual errors or misrepresentations of any kind that makes a person i like look bad
5774269 ron paul never had a chance so i am perplexed at why so much ink is spent on him

5774319 i want to take a moment to write about a topic that gets little to no coverage anymore i want to write about non rich media
5774320 for the hp touchsmart pc campaign we wanted to do something a little different with the space the product is so unique we could let it speak for itself as much as possible so we incorporated a lot of content normally reserved for a landing page like the tv spot and the specs visually we needed to generate excitement and with a lot of cutting edge flash sites being created with papervision code we thought wed try our hand at creating something that quite literally pops out from the page the 3d effect of the banner is such that every time i see it on a page i cant resist spending some time playing with it myself it was challenging to create and distribute something so advanced but we worked with the best and the end result is fantastic

5774328 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5774329 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5774330 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
5774331 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
5774332 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
5774333 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
5774334 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
5774335 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
5774336 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
5774337 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
5774338 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido
5774339 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5774340 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5774341 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5774342 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5774343 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5774344 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5774345 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5774346 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5774347 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5774348 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
5774349 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5774350 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
5774351 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5774352 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales

5774354 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
5774355 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5774356 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5774357 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5774358 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
5774359 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
5774360 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
5774361 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
5774362 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
5774363 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

5774382 the a amp l board sees no obvious circumstances that are likely materially to improve conditions in the financial markets or the broader economic outlook in the near to medium term and has concluded that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value

5774397 this milestone only serves to illustrate the 432nd wings absolute obligation to our ground forces
5774398 four hundred thousand flight hours is a huge number and it takes thousands of men and women here at creech and our air national guard partners at their bases grinding it out to continue to fight over iraq and afghanistan every hour of every day
5774399 it takes great skill to operate the most persistent strike intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platform in the world
5774400 the men and women of the 432nd wing have proved time and again that they are the most qualified for the job which is why the predator remains one of the most sought after assets in the war on terrorism
5774401 while its an honor to be a part of such a historic event this is only one of many more uas milestones to come
5774402 our airmen are flying missions 24 hours a day seven days a week and doing it so well that our combatant commanders are constantly asking for more and theyre getting it
5774403 thanks to our uas airmen there is no telling in the space of 400 000 hours how many servicemembers lives have been saved how many insurgents have been taken out and how many attacks against coalition forces have been stopped before they began

5774486 we play with just one putter and a whole variety of minigolf balls you dont change the putter but youre allowed to change the ball on each hole

5774506 funding is one of the major difficulties we face in the period that the refugees have lived in the country but i believe this also a responsibility of the international community to be much involved as well
5774507 our small loans are about k 500 000 each about us 140 now however weve switched to giving out agro loans in which we give out bags of fertilizer during the planting season and are repaid in maize after the crops have been harvested
5774508 it is envisaged that the refugees grow enough food to sustain themselves and sell the surplus food
5774509 i now own a bakery and i have been able to pay back the loan i got
5774510 we have found out that refugees can be very reliable when given the right tools education and support
5774511 our goal will be to protect and re settle those refugees as unhcr we think re settling them is a primarily tool we can used to protect them refugees

5774513 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in

5774515 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5774516 it is horrifying the incident further shows that violence in south african schools is a real problem and people especially parents are worried about it
5774517 it is an extreme situation also underlying the general problems facing our youth problems of identity confidence in the future abuse of drugs and breakdown of familys moral system

5774586 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
5774587 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
5774588 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
5774589 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
5774590 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form

5774621 football game is being developed for all of those platforms but most developers dont have the resources to match electronic arts and cant develop for all those platforms

5774817 all uk doctors should seriously consider ignoring such exceedingly dangerous gmc guidance relating to the reporting of knife attack incidents to the police until the uk government can comprehensively guarantee the perpetual safety of such doctors and their families from retaliatory gangland attacks i was born and grew up in south london where most of these horrific attacks are taking place and i can firmly tell you that if the word ever got out that a medical doctor in the community was eagerly gossiping to the police then that particular doctor and his whole extended family will be much more likely to be smoked out of the area with or without a few wrecked limbs or more ethnic minority doctors must additionally be exceedingly careful when dealing with the police as in quite a few cases certain racist police officers have shockingly pounced on the doctors instead of the crooks and wickedly reported them to the gmc over totally unrelated matters which may have happened very many years ago so my basic advice is pure and simple dont snitch without full bullet proofing

5774850 they need relief now so my attitude is lets build up the system we got lets make it more efficient we may be over time as we make the system more efficient and everybodys covered decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively
5774851 ill run through the job then ask you a couple of questions before my colleagues ask theirs and then ill finish off by going through your criminal record
5774852 get out or ill kill you i swear to god ill kill you

5774857 the bengals tried for an extended period of time to support chris and his potentially bright career we had hoped to guide him toward an appropriate standard of personal responsibility that this community would support and that would allow him to play in the nfl but those efforts end today as we move on with what is best for our team
5774858 im just glad theyre willing to let the past be the past and give him a chance
5774859 i just hope that the cincinnati fans will give him the same type of chance
5774860 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5774861 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5774862 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left
5774863 however i think developments in georgia could make the ukrainian leadership and the people in ukraine question whether it is actually worth it now russia has the potential to destabilise ukraine this would be a horrible development for europe
5774864 nothing will change regarding frances policy in afghanistan were determined to remain at the of our allies
5774865 we would not have been able to remove musharraf if we had not stayed together similarly we will not be able to restore judges if we dont stay together similarly we will not be able to correct anomalies in the constitution unless we stay together
5774866 all the accusations are against us as if there was nothing in the text demanding that georgian forces return to their pre crisis positions
5774867 by 22 august a part of the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the temporary security zone
5774868 the remaining contingent that was used to reinforce the peacekeepers will be pulled back to the territory of south ossetia and to russia
5774869 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of president medvedev to abide by the six point peace plan he signed together with the president of georgia which is not happening at the moment which is not happening as we speak
5774870 the united states doesnt seek to isolate russia the behaviour of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia from the principles of cooperation among nations of the communities of states when you start invading small neighbours
5774871 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source

5774888 the a amp l board sees no obvious circumstances that are likely materially to improve conditions in the financial markets or the broader economic outlook in the near to medium term and has concluded that there is a risk of external events further eroding shareholder value
5774889 it is normal sensible practice you might call it good risk management from the companys point of view
5774890 it needs the top people to stay and run the business it a business they like and want to build on not asset strip the executives also know where the bodies are buried

5774918 the standard of competition and the spread that this sport has reached worldwide sometimes we struggle to compete against the africans i feel like im representing a huge range of track and field fans so its just a real honor to be able to carry the mantle and reach the medal podium

5774920 my massage therapist said theres something about it nic where you dont necessarily see it but it oozes out of you that you believe that you can do this stuff
5774921 i dont necessarily realize that but the fact that everyone else sees that just reminds me

5774931 must take critical steps today to avoid locking in to an obsolete high emissions trajectory
5774932 if india wants to be a global superpower it must also take on global super responsibilities
5774933 indias low average per capita emissions is due to the over 800 million poor population whose emissions are negligible
5774934 the cost of climate change in india could even be as high as a 9 13 loss in gdp by 2100 compared to a no climate change scenario
5774935 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5774936 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5774945 traditional procurement models can be a death blow to many large and small companies
5774946 we developed the prorizon software as a service saas procurement concept after spending seven years servicing back office operations like ing investment management llc this model helps companies revolutionize their procurement processes with a combination of business processes software and staff resources that can reduce order processing costs by as much as 75 percent
5774947 the weight of evidence we examined from both historical and modern analyses of the 1918 influenza pandemic favors a scenario in which viral damage followed by bacterial pneumonia led to the vast majority of deaths
5774948 in essence the virus landed the first blow while bacteria delivered the knockout punch
5774949 ranging from changes characteristic of the primary viral pneumonia and evidence of tissue repair to evidence of severe acute secondary bacterial pneumonia
5774950 clearly and consistently implicated secondary bacterial pneumonia caused by common upper respiratory flora in most influenza fatalities
5774951 we are encouraged by the fact that pandemic planners are already considering and implementing some of these actions
5774952 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5774953 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5774954 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5774955 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5774956 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5774957 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5774958 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5774959 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5774960 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5774961 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5774962 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5774963 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5774964 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5774965 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5774966 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5774967 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5774968 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5774969 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5774970 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5774971 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5774972 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5774973 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5774974 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5774975 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5774976 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5774977 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5774978 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5774979 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5774980 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5774981 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5774982 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5774983 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5774984 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5774985 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5774986 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5774987 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5774988 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5774989 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5774996 we want the customers to have the information its just a challenge to present it so its of value to the guest
5774997 if you have a sandwich and you have your choice of hash browns onion rings french fries or fresh fruit theres a range of calories how do you present that so customers arent reading a book
5774998 our big steak omelette has almost as many calories as adult female needs for the entire day
5774999 as the industry moves forward and people are more and more health conscious i believe consumers are going to start expecting that
5775000 people dont want to be fat or obese left to their own devices people want to be healthy
5775001 menu labeling is a powerful education tool and information is power in the dietary world
5775002 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5775003 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5775005 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5775006 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5775007 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5775008 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5775009 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5775010 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5775011 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5775012 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5775013 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5775014 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5775015 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5775016 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5775017 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5775018 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5775019 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5775020 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5775021 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
5775022 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
5775023 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
5775024 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
5775025 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5775026 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5775027 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5775028 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5775029 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5775030 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5775031 mas n o vai ser uma conversa criando expectativas ou sensacionalismo esse grupo n o ag enta mais press o e todas as a es que forem tomadas ser o dentro da normalidade o que eu puder fazer para dar tranq ilidade a todos vou fazer
5775032 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5775033 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5775034 but it is abundantly clear that if you put an immediate stop to this you will certainly cut off supplies of some types of vegetables to cities as almost 75 percent of the cities source at least some of their vegetables from urban and peri urban agriculture which uses wastewater
5775035 this is not an encouragement to use wastewater but a push to improve practices
5775036 wherever this situation is not given we agree with the world health organisation who that it is not necessary to stop wastewater irrigation
5775037 we tested and verified this approach its implementation however requires behaviour change and social marketing of food safety like we see it in hand washing campaigns
5775038 this is part of the global water crisis from a water quality perspective where uncontrolled discharge of wastewater is polluting large volumes of fresh water
5775039 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

5775075 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5775076 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5775077 its not the relationship we would have wanted to inherit
5775078 its going to be in pretty bad shape for the next president of the united states
5775079 there is a reason why they the bush administration were not focused on abkhazia and south ossetia georgias separatist regions because they were focused on iraq

5775084 we are going to carry on with the same work ive been doing since my arrival
5775085 of course the pressure and the questions will increase but i have enough confidence in what i am doing to carry on with the job
5775086 its at this sort of moment that we see how people react
5775087 we won the copa america in 2007 and today we lost and that is the life of the sportsman we have to have the strength to react
5775088 without doubt he has a future he was always an example its not just about what happens on the pitch
5775089 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up you have to give everything up because you cant have it all and it sucks im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5775090 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5775091 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5775092 jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children
5775093 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5775094 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5775095 well i felt myself leave my body i just floated out of my physical form and i saw them cart my body away to the hospital i went with it i wasnt frightened or anything like that because i was fine and it was my body that was in trouble
5775096 i looked around myself and i saw an incredibly beautiful bright loving white light above me i wanted to go to that white light more than anything ive never wanted anything more i know there was love real love on the other side of the light which was attracting me so much it was kind and loving and i remember thinking thats god
5775097 then i saw a hand reach through the light i tried to touch it to grab onto it to clasp it so it could sweep me up and pull me through it
5775098 its not time go back and finish its not time
5775099 the repeated act of dying became for peter sellers the most important experience of his life
5775100 the experience of resurrection intensified sellers spiritual concern and friends discerned the start of a new introspectiveness a sense of his not
5775101 sitting still over lengthy periods saying nothing but staring at her with his thoughts turned inward
5775102 i was pronounced dead once and actually saw the light
5775103 wow this sounds really screwy i think id better keep quiet about this
5775104 for a long time i didnt talk about it and its still hard for me to talk about but i have shared it with people with aids because if the moment occurs and youre really sharing its real i am not afraid of death because i have been there
5775105 when it hit me i felt like id been shot in the head
5775106 i think ive had a stroke i think ive had a heart attack i think ive had a brain hemorrhage i had a real journey with this that took me to places both here and beyond that affected me so profoundly that my life will never be the same i get to be not afraid of dying and i get to tell other people that its a fabulous thing and that death is a gift and not that you should kill yourself but that when death comes to you as it will that its a glorious and beautiful thing this kind of giant vortex of white light was upon me and i kind of poof sort of took off into this glorious bright bright bright white light and i started to see and be met by some of my friends but it was very fast whoosh suddenly i was back i was in my body and i was in the room
5775107 a miracle happened i was given a second chance and this has been a way to stay on the straight and narrow for 30 years with the exception of a period in 1975 where i went off the track prior to ordination when people hear the hell i went through on drugs they listen to how to get off them
5775108 i had the sense that i was about to embark on a very compelling journey but suddenly i was jolted out of the vision i knew i had to make major changes in my life
5775109 if it wasnt for sam i probably wouldnt be here he had to bring me back to life twice
5775110 i didnt know where i was or how long id been there i would drift in and out of consciousness other times there would be a white light shining through the darkness but no f king angels no one blowing trumpets and no man in a white beard
5775111 you are bopping along through life and have your ups and downs but it is amazing how two or three seconds can totally change your life
5775112 i entered into a dark tunnel and suddenly i was in a place filled up with love and a beautiful bright light
5775113 theres always a story mode in almost all of namcos titles these days

5775115 similarly doyle has said publicly that he would sign a bill ending the minimum markup law if it reached his desk no such bill has reached his desk in part due to strange votes of people like sen glenn grothman r west bend who in 2005 voted in committee against ending the law over concerns that gas stations wouldnt be able to cover the cost of credit card transactions its not clear what part of the state constitution stipulates that legislators duties include monitoring gas station credit card transaction fees

5775117 we believe the system is being exploited and we are very concerned
5775118 it is relatively clear that the foreigners are not requesting asylum to stay in sweden but simply to receive support
5775119 more of those who have asked for the return funding retracted their asylum application themselves than had it rejected
5775120 theres been a rush to small cars but that doesnt necessarily mean the shift is permanent
5775121 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
5775122 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
5775123 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences
5775124 the market size for cleantech will be measured in the trillions of dollars its immeasurably deep
5775125 we dont want to take anyones job in these difficult economic times but looking at the most recent weather map we dont see any signs of the heavy rain and winds predicted for the next 24 hours here

5775129 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
5775130 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5775131 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice
5775132 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice

5775137 after the review of my draft article by the wnd editorial staff i agreed the piece should be withdrawn
5775138 as i explained on the radio i am typically interested in scientific evidence that lies outside the explanation of conventional hypotheses
5775139 science advances by rejecting hypotheses not by establishing hypotheses in other words should somebody find convincing scientific evidence that challenges some aspect of any official report that evidence will not automatically confirm the truth of an alternative hypothesis
5775140 put simply even if we had published the article all we would have established was that there were some questions yet to be resolved with the governments 9 11 explanation not that an alternative hypothesis was suddenly correct

5775201 lets consider a reevaluation of the situation in which we assume that the stuckness now occurring the zero of consciousness isnt the worst of all possible situations but the best possible situation you could be in
5775202 the solution to the problem often at first seems unimportant or undesirable but the state of stuckness allows it in time to assume its true importance it seemed small because your previous rigid evaluation which led to the stuckness made it small
5775203 but now consider the fact that no matter how hard you try to hang on to it this stuckness is bound to disappear
5775204 stuckness shouldnt be avoided its the psychic predecessor of all real understanding an egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all quality in mechanical work as in other endeavors

5775228 i think theres always a concern that when you bring in new people that you limit your time with the old people
5775229 i think that the producers have done a very good job this year of balancing that i think they understood that when we were all separated in the second season the fans werent too into that when you bring in a new character bring him in with a reason bring him in with a purpose dont just pack it with a bunch of new faces that nobody knows
5775230 jamies character knox has a great presence in this whole chapter so does breas character shes got a huge presence and theyre both fun
5775231 its a pretty easy going group here and i got to say jamie and brea fit in really nice
5775232 that was always one of those things that had such a huge mystery behind it
5775233 i think every scene that we do were discovering more than what we had just talked about arthurs such a complicated character he impacts everybody for his own need or want to be important and be the most powerful
5775234 its great ive worked with him before in a movie called cursed which died a very awful death he was in the film and then they rewrote the film and he wasnt in it so i got a chance to spend time on the set its nice being back on set hes a great guy and im having a lot of fun
5775235 a lot of it is a bit of pride and a bit of grain and salt you feel proud that theyre talking about it
5775236 youre excited by the fact that theyre talking about it but also you know that if you sit around and read everything that you see online its like man your going to spend a lot of time doing that personally id like to show up at work and then go be with my family and friends
5775237 a lot of that i havent been able to see theres so much information if youre really seeking it
5775238 i guess because i live in that world everyday i dont really have such a pull to go online and find out what mohinder suresh is up to
5775239 it wasnt like i got second by 3 or 5 tenths i had the same exact score thats what makes it a little harder to take but you cant control the judges after you land your dismount its all up to them and you kind of have to leave it at that
5775240 i dont think a lot of people know whats going on right now i have no idea either
5775241 thats the rules and you have to play by them
5775242 getting my medal the fig official that was up there she said sorry its too bad about the rules
5775243 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5775244 i have no idea and cant answer if he is underage but shes done her hard work and her preparation and she deserved that olympic gold medal today
5775245 it wasnt like i got second by 3 or 5 tenths i had the same exact score thats what makes it a little harder to take but you cant control the judges after you land your dismount its all up to them and you kind of have to leave it at that

5775251 at the end of the day like my dad told me
5775252 he might be the best olympic athlete of all time
5775253 you talk about tiger woods michael phelps and michael jordan
5775254 hes part of that class where they dominate the sport
5775255 they hated us it seemed like people hated us and in four years we have completely turned that around
5775256 part of that is changing the culture our culture in athens was terrible this time around we made an effort to let everybody know were good guys
5775257 but overall its been great everything was just a blast better than i thought
5775258 you know one of my big dreams was to be an olympian and i did that and the next dream is a championship so i have three more years left in dallas and hopefully one of those years we can achieve my goal
5775259 he might be the best olympic athlete of all time
5775260 you talk about tiger woods michael phelps and michael jordan
5775261 hes part of that class where they dominate the sport
5775262 they hated us it seemed like people hated us and in four years we have completely turned that around
5775263 part of that is changing the culture our culture in athens was terrible this time around we made an effort to let everybody know were good guys
5775264 but overall its been great everything was just a blast better than i thought
5775265 you know one of my big dreams was to be an olympian and i did that and the next dream is a championship so i have three more years left in dallas and hopefully one of those years we can achieve my goal
5775266 my silver medal is gold to me because of all the bad things that happened to me this year
5775267 athens was my first olympic medal i was so happy because i was in a hole and had to dig myself back
5775268 i just love that part just watching the scores pop up and see if theyre higher or lower thats one of my favourite things
5775269 we knew we were doing well we knew we were right on track weve been saying that the whole first week
5775270 we had faith and we were confident the morale was there the enthusiasm was there and we were just waiting for these medals we knew they were coming tonight its great i feel so great

5775281 ok this is abbey the picture is almost 1 year old but its just too darned cute not too submit plus she has grown up to be a great dog though she has this herding instinct that causes her to pace around the house until everyone is properly situated in the same room her sister zoey deserves a future submission as well

5775289 so far we have not seen any significant movement out of georgia
5775290 we have seen media reports indicating that people are being shot at while trying to leave the area
5775291 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5775292 as the mother of a daughter who is close to entering college it is deeply disappointing to me that many of our educational leaders would support an initiative without doing their homework on the underlying research and science
5775293 parents should think twice before sending their teens to these colleges or any others that have waved the white flag on underage and binge drinking policies
5775294 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5775295 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5775296 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5775297 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5775298 signing this initiative does serious harm to the education and enforcement efforts on our campuses and ultimately endangers young lives even more
5775299 i ask every higher education leader who has signed to reconsider i am old enough to remember life on our campuses before the 21 year drinking rule it was horrible
5775300 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5775301 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5775302 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5775303 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5775304 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5775305 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5775306 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5775307 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
5775308 perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been the best at it
5775309 for a minute there it was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that

5775318 first we are giving opportunity of employment to one quarter of a million of the unemployed especially the young men who have dependents to go into the forestry and flood prevention work this is a big task because it means feeding clothing and caring for nearly twice as many men as we have in the regular army itself in creating this civilian conservation corps we are killing two birds with one stone we are clearly enhancing the value of our natural resources and second we are relieving an appreciable amount of actual distress
5775319 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally

5775343 although the majority 86 8 per cent of hospitalized mental health cases were treated in general hospitals psychiatric hospitals continue to account for more than half 50 6 per cent of all hospital days related to a mental health diagnosis reflecting the longer stays among patients in these specialized facilities
5775344 in comparison with published figures for average length of stay dating back to 1982 1983 both the averages for general and psychiatric hospitals represent historic lows for length of hospital stay in canada

5775349 the georgian air force and artillery struck the sleeping town at midnight more than 1 500 civilians perished in the first hours of the shelling at the same time georgian special forces shot 10 russian peacekeepers who didnt expect such a betrayal from their georgian colleagues
5775350 does that mean that the us and nato can use brute force when they want to his parallel incidentally and russia has to abstain from it even if it has to look at thousands of its own citizens being shot

5775354 through general dynamics acquisition of this strong and rapidly growing organization we will expand our participation in the business aviation industry well beyond that of our current operations
5775355 worldwide creditors are tightening their standards and consumers and businesses are correcting their courses the correction in the housing market has yet to find its bottom credit markets remain tempestuous us consumers are being hammered by declining real income us savers and investors are being squeezed by negative real interest rates and us companies business margins are under pressure
5775356 i expect us economic growth will decelerate to a snails pace if not completely grind to a halt in the second half of this year indeed we may see the slowdown extend into 2009 as the excesses that drove the housing markets unwind before the economy can again gear up to cruising speed
5775357 until we have a clear sense of what will prevail monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures
5775358 since these forecasts were made i think the risks for growth have increased and the risks for inflation remain elevated and a concern indeed total inflation has exceeded core inflation pretty consistently for over five years with both measures above 2 percent during much of this time i view these persistently high rates of overall and core inflation as important concerns for monetary policy
5775359 it has become increasingly clear to me that the fed funds rate alone is neither an adequate or even an entirely appropriate tool for addressing instability in the financial markets however the ongoing challenges in financial markets indicate the continued need for substantial liquidity in order to facilitate their functioning and to ensure adequate funding for creditworthy businesses and households
5775360 there are serious upside risks around that central projection which stem from the possible impact of continuing high inflation in the near term on pay growth and on inflation expectations
5775361 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
5775362 this spiral has to be nipped in the bud and that means having interest rates at a suitable level until the threat of higher inflation has passed all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the two percent target by the end of 2009 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5775363 some have looked to the mpc to cut its interest rate to help but our job is to fight inflation because thats the best basis for the economy to grow create jobs and allow living standards to rise
5775364 he had experienced some chest pains and hes in for testing

5775398 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5775399 is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5775400 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5775401 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5775402 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5775403 when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5775404 now its time to succeed in iraq by turning iraq over to its sovereign government
5775405 we should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched we should not keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq while americans struggle in a sluggish economy
5775406 ending the war will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
5775407 this crisis underscores the need for engaged u s leadership in the world
5775408 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed american leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that were not merely responding to them
5775409 those silvers mean more to me than anything ever could and i wouldnt trade them in for a gold at any time
5775410 when youre training for the olympics youre training for that gold
5775411 when i didnt get that gold of course you get different emotions
5775412 but just looking back on it and actually knowing and appreciating that i had a medal it means more to me than anything the whole experience and everything thats happened its just the best feeling ever
5775413 i was making very uncharacteristic mistakes that i havent made in a long time
5775414 i mean change anything that ive done in the past week i dont know how things would have turned out
5775415 you hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race and its just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life
5775416 when youre racing a car and youre going max velocity and you hit a curb you can either maintain control or crash and burn
5775417 sometimes i think we get tested to see what well do
5775418 weve definitely been under a big test as a family
5775419 i think our childhood comes into play a lot making her the person she is
5775420 everything happens for a reason and for whatever reason we had to endure a lot as children
5775421 it made us survivors no one deserves this more than her
5775422 these are tears of sadness definitely not tears of joy
5775423 they keep saying lolo youre the favorite to go in and i tell them no its hurdles 10 obstacles in front of us and anybody can hit any one of those
5775424 about the middle part of the race the hurdles were just coming up very fast
5775425 and if you cant youre not meant to be champion so today i was not meant to be champion
5775426 i had to walk away from my baby we were always together thats the first time i had to leave her
5775427 i had managed to keep us all together but she was doing so good in high school that i didnt want her to leave
5775428 she was on her way and i knew she was on her way i knew
5775429 has sunk into such economic difficulties that it may be likened to a sinking titanic whose passengers are jumping out in a bid to save their lives
5775430 his passing on is a sad day to the zimbabwean people
5775431 you people in the west redeem yourself before you begin attacking china
5775432 while we are making a lot of improvements the mobileme service is still not up to our standards
5775433 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same times as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
5775434 we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
5775435 when i was informed by i am assuming mr kerrys people that i should not peek in that hangar and that it was in fact closed for the day
5775436 around 6 that evening i peeked in and saw they were putting john edwards name on the airplane
5775437 they concealed it rather quickly they taped paper over the logos i just happened to peek in at the right time

5775469 just as governor jindal established ngo criteria for greater transparency and objectivity in the appropriation of state tax dollars for state priorities this executive order and these guidelines aim to increase accountability by verifying that the money is being used properly
5775470 cost reimbursement is the most effective accountability measure to make sure funds are being utilized the way legislators intended recipients may obtain funding in advance provided they demonstrate and justify need by submitting a business plan commensurate with the complexity of the funded activity whether the organizations are large or small it is not too much to ask these recipients of taxpayer money to demonstrate that they are using taxpayer money in the way its supposed to be used
5775471 the lra realized early on that hurricane recovery was a regional process the city of was proud to be included in the regional planning effort
5775472 the lra produced a redevelopment plan for southwest centered around a remodeled downtown lakefront once the plan is fully implemented it will anchor long term economic development for our entire region
5775473 this demolition in lake charles is the culmination of months of planning that began after hurricane rita and allowed the community to identify the downtown area as its top long term priority for the city
5775474 as the old building crashes down and new businesses sprout up we can all be proud of this citizen led rebuilding in southwest which is exactly what wed hoped for when we started planning for our states future
5775475 were pleased to have played a small enabling role through our early long term recovery staff planning efforts
5775476 we commend the people of and mayor roach on their success and look forward to the continued partnership in recovery efforts

5775699 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5775700 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5775701 this is a planning took where all things are going
5775702 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5775703 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5775704 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5775705 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5775706 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5775707 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5775708 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5775709 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5775710 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5775711 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5775712 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5775713 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5775714 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5775715 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5775716 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5775717 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5775718 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5775719 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5775720 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5775721 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5775722 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5775723 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5775724 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5775725 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5775726 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5775727 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5775728 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5775729 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5775730 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5775731 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5775732 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5775733 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5775734 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5775735 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5775736 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5775737 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5775738 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5775739 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5775740 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5775741 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5775742 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5775743 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5775744 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5775745 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5775746 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5775747 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5775748 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5775749 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5775750 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5775751 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5775752 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5775753 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5775754 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5775755 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5775756 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5775757 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5775758 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5775759 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5775760 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5775761 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5775762 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5775763 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5775764 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5775765 ce qui ne me tue pas me rend plus fort
5775766 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5775767 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5775768 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5775769 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5775770 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

5775816 there is no correlation between the letter received two weeks ago and the incident that happened yesterday
5775817 were continuing to look at how the piece of pipe got there it did look suspicious but there was nothing in it that would make it dangerous
5775818 there was no note it was more of a coincidence its certainly logical the two are connected but theyre not
5775819 early in the week they go through a car check the condition of the car clean out any trash its just part of the daily operation

5775855 i hope ill have a trouble free weekend to try to set up the car the best way possible especially for the qualifying lap
5775856 the qualifying will be extremely important although i think that there are some possibilities on the track to overtake
5775857 like at montreal you also need a bit of luck and i hope that it will not end for me as it did in canada
5775858 we just have to fight until the end and try to win
5775859 again this season shows that you should never give up
5775860 there were some races where things didnt go to well but for one reason or another i was able to collect some precious points
5775861 my position after hungary is better than before the race we havent lost anything but we need to get better results consistently
5775862 i think that the outcome of the championship will be very tight with ferrari and mclaren very close together in terms of performance and three drivers in a position to win the title

5775876 ma non contro le prostitute straniere che volete le prostitute sono le navi scuola dei giovani
5775877 oltre alle 6 ragazze che hanno reso denuncia si ritiene siano state sfruttate tra il 2004 ed il 2006 circa 80 giovani met delle quali minorenni con guadagni non inferiori ai 100 000 euro lo sfruttamento avveniva in massima parte
5775878 eravamo il paese dei latin lover e siamo diventati un popolo di clienti della prostituzione cos le bande di trafficanti si adeguano la domanda di sesso a pagamento aumenta loro procurano lofferta con ragazze sempre pi giovani fino alle baby squillo insulto un po cinematografico per indicare ragazzine strappate dai banchi di scuola e mandate in tanga e canottiera a vendersi sui viali alla periferia di roma le fanno dormire nelle grotte la via salaria un postribolo di minorenni al chiaro dei lampioni e spesso anche alla luce del pomeriggio lo stesso dopo le 11 di sera diventa via cristoforo colombo larteria che porta al mare e allaeroporto di fiumicino a milano non occorre uscire dalla citt ragazze europee e africane sono tornate a occupare piazzale loreto viale abruzzi la circonvallazione fin dentro i quartieri semicentrali come i navigli e il parco ravizza dalle parti di perugia hanno scoperto una gang di moldavi che legava le adolescenti alle pareti di una stalla abbandonata ma la distribuzione di ragazze capillare su tutta la penisola raggiunge le campagne sperdute perch l la domanda dei clienti su camion e trattori altrettanto forte come lungo la statale 16 tra foggia e san severo dove non esistono altro che campi di pomodoro e vigne la notte le nigeriane bruciano i copertoni per farsi vedere di giorno vanno a dormire nellex zuccherificio a rignano garganico oppure la statale adriatica da rimini a san benedetto del tronto e ancora bari catania cremona prato aosta treviso al di fuori dei confini dellunione europea il mondo pieno di famiglie ridotte alla fame i trafficanti non fanno altro che portare le figlie di quelle famiglie l dove clienti ricchi possono mantenere loro e i loro sfruttatori
5775879 larrivo di minorenni purtroppo un effetto indotto involontariamente da noi gli organismi investigativi negli ultimi anni hanno snobbato le indagini sullo sfruttamento per contrastare il fenomeno le questure hanno scelto la via pi veloce dei rimpatri come azione preventiva sono state espulse le donne questo ha fatto crescere larrivo di minorenni perch i minori non possono essere espulsi le organizzazioni hanno poi cambiato politica ora alle ragazze lasciano anche il 30 o il 50 per cento dellincasso ed evitano di sottoporle a violenze rapimenti e stupri cos le ragazze non scappano non denunciano e hanno pi incentivi a rimanere nel giro laltro aspetto nuovo la mobilit delle prostitute le fanno spostare in continuazione una settimana sulla salaria poi sulla domiziana poi le ritrovi sulla romea lo spostamento impedisce eventuali legami affettivi con i clienti ma questo nasconde un dato preoccupante che dobbiamo approfondire lesistenza di una rete comune di contatti tra le squadre di sfruttatori che sulla strada sono quasi sempre romeni o albanesi

5775884 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5775885 were obviously focusing on aspects that have to do with strategic or military situation but we will of course review everything
5775886 there can be no business as normal with russia under the current circumstances
5775887 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5775888 this still hasnt happened every day several episodes still occur when our servicemen detain georgian troops
5775889 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5775890 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world
5775891 angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5775892 and therefore did not fully vet the candidate they shoved down everyones throat
5775893 the court finds that the ballot title and summary provided in the proposition for amendment 5 fail to fairly inform the voter in a clear and unambiguous language of the chief purposes of the amendment and the language of the title and summary as written is misleading in the foregoing respects
5775894 the interactions with the people in the network arent as much about problem solving as they are about presence and connectedness
5775895 a lot of things have happened in this century and most of them plug into walls
5775896 a change in an environment is rarely only additive or linear what you have is a totally new environment requiring a whole new repertoire of survival strategies
5775897 when you plug something into a wall someone is getting plugged into you which means you need new patterns of defense perception understanding evaluation you need a new kind of education
5775898 as the number of messages increases the amount of information carried decreases we have more media to communicate fewer significant ideas
5775899 change isnt new whats new is the degree of change change changed
5775900 change occurs so rapidly that each of us in the course of our lives has continuously to work out a set of values beliefs and patterns of behavior that are viable or seem viable to each of us personally and just when we have identified a workable system it turns out to be irrelevant because so much has changed while we were doing it
5775901 the trouble is that most teachers have the idea that they are in some other sort of business some believe for example that they are in the information dissemination business
5775902 while students have to live with tv film the lp record communication satellites and the laser beam their teachers are still talking as if the only medium on the scene is gutenbergs printing press
5775903 while students have to understand psychology and psychedelics anthropology and anthropomorphism birth control and biochemistry their teachers are teaching subjects that mostly dont exist anymore
5775904 while students need to find new roles for themselves as social political and religious organisms their teachers are acting almost entirely as shills for corporate interests shaping them up to be functionaries in one bureaucracy or another
5775905 future shock occurs when you are confronted by the fact that the world you were educated to believe in doesnt exist
5775906 we just may not survive another generation of inadvertent entropy helpers

5775992 lifting of emergency holding of parliamentary polls first and permanent release of sheikh hasina will be our main issues for discussion
5775993 at the talks we will point out the inadequacy in the election commissions competence level and ask it to concentrate on the issue from now because it could be an important factor for poll results
5775994 we are observing the situation and will accordingly take decision about the time of discussion and agenda for it

5775999 we all are proceeding with graft cases in the trial court with the spirit of quick disposal but it appears that the same spirit is absent during dealing of the appeals
5776000 i dont want to move for quick disposal of the appeals as my client thinks he wont get justice during the caretaker government rule he wants the hearing to begin after the elections when an elected government will be in power
5776001 some convicts may choose this strategy but i think the appeals against graft case verdicts are not coming in the serial for hearing due to long queue and backlog of cases
5776002 this sort of case is not new every week some workers are deported from dubai for similar reasons
5776003 our mission bangladesh embassy in dubai cannot attest all the visas issued for our workers besides the small number of officials cannot attest all of the approximately 30 000 visas issued a month
5776004 the government should take up the issue immediately with uae authorities otherwise workers will continue to suffer and the travel agents that arrange the air tickets for the workers will also be affected as they have to pay the cost of for the return ticket of the deported workers
5776005 we shall take actions against the recruiting agencies who processed the documents for the deported workers

5776031 being black in america from the ghetto you need that extra little bit of confidence so thats kind of my mission to give other kids that kind of confidence
5776032 he is truly a scholar and a humanitarian who just happens to be a chart topping rapper
5776033 i feared him getting involved in drugs feared him getting involved in a lot of stuff that could have been devastating to him
5776034 i told him if you are going to rap at least dont use bad language and dont talk down about women and he said mom thats not me anyway i dont do that so i was able to hear his music it wasnt church music but it certainly was a positive message
5776035 but i didnt do it quick enough or he thought
5776036 i got to the point whats this all about am i really having a significant impact on peoples lives just showing up in a city for an hour and doing a show and then leaving
5776037 i thought stardom and fame would bring me a kind of a joy when i attained that it was empty
5776038 to see ahmad break down a lot of stereotypes of folks who go into the music industry in general let alone hip hop or rap and then return to higher education and go to stanford is a remarkable story

5776046 it is horrifying the incident further shows that violence in south african schools is a real problem and people especially parents are worried about it

5776060 i think club musicians share similar situations trying to please an audience placate the management keep the band in line and get paid

5776064 i knew the street language picked up by jack kerouac and the beat generation was designed to confuse outsiders and thought i could use it to thoroughly disorient my readers as author anthony burgess did with his future speak in a clockwork orange it was a revelation to me that much of the beat generation slang is in frequent use today the hippie slang i used when young 10 years beyond kerouac was more than an offshoot of beat it was nearly identical still theres enough unrecognizable slang in jazz cool birth to feed readers curiosity dig

5776146 i left a very special situation at marquette when indiana offered me this opportunity
5776147 i wanted to make sure that if i left i would be going to a place that would be a destination for my family and allow me to build a program for the long haul with the same security
5776148 i appreciate the confidence that president mcrobbie and the university have shown in me by offering the two additional years to the agreement
5776149 it is a great responsibility to lead this program and i look forward to the challenge of bringing the program the respect it deserves the process of restoring this great program is going to take a lot of time more than probably any of us anticipated
5776150 once again the nit season tip off tournament features an outstanding field and we look forward to another exciting start to college basketball
5776151 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5776152 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5776153 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5776154 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5776155 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5776156 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5776157 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5776158 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5776159 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5776160 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

5776165 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
5776166 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle

5776190 bagged salad and salad dressings in the united states 2008
5776191 we argue that humans possess an innate system for enumeration that doesnt rely on words
5776192 basic number and arithmetic skills are built on a specialized innate system
5776193 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5776194 perhaps the most striking result comes from the cross modal matching task where the child has to put out the number of counters corresponding to a sequence of auditory events
5776195 this cannot be done using visual memory but requires the child to generate a mental representation that is abstract enough to serve to represent both auditory and visual enumeration
5776196 in order to demonstrate their desired conclusion the authors would need to evaluate an age group across languages with and without number words where the participants in the language with number words can succeed in getting close to 100 percent accuracy on the tasks then the effects of the absence of number words can be evaluated in the population speaking the language that lacks number words
5776197 in our recent work we have demonstrated that piraha speakers achieve high accuracy on matching tasks despite having no count words whatsoever not even a word for one
5776198 were so looking forward to working with each again and we just need to find a time in our diaries when we can get into the studio together

5776200 and then there was the time that one of them simply wouldnt return her calls to his office so she called the number he did not know that she had and she said to the woman that answered that this was so embarrassing but as he was no longer talking to her he be told that she was still waiting for the return of her lacy black underthings which he had taken because he said they smelled of her of both of them oh and that reminded her she said as the woman on the other end of the phone said nothing could they be laundered first and then simply posted back to her he has her address and then her business joyfully concluded she forgets him utterly and forever and she turns her attention to the next one day she wont love you too it will break your heart

5776214 there are many many places where a homeland for the palestinians could in fact take place that would be consistent with their roots
5776215 but there is only one place on earth where the jewish people could have a homeland that is consistent with their roots
5776216 we have a moral obligation to the jewish people to honor the commitment that has been made through decades and decades of understanding that there is going to be a homeland for the jewish people
5776217 the question shouldnt be do arabs have a right to live in jewish territory
5776218 but do jews have a right to live in jewish territory
5776219 to say that jews cant live in jerusalem is the equivalent of telling the boston red sox they cant play in fenway park obviously that would never go over very well on beacon hill
5776220 in terms of the deepest roots and attachment to the land of israel mike huckabee really wins out

5776241 for i see him as the king of sorrow and the crown on his head is a crown of thorns and the nailprints in his hands and feet are the scars of terrible agony i also give myself to him forever for sorrow with him must be sweeter than any joy i have ever known
5776242 for no one but he could unite joy and sorrow

5776246 well i think we are fortunate in scotland we have a number of top class midfield players so thats an area where we have players with similar talents to barry
5776247 ive got selection problems in that position ive got no problem filling that role
5776248 of course you miss barry barry was the captain he was a big inspiration on and off the field
5776249 i think at the beginning of the season it shows how much rangers have missed him but we have other players to come in and i have already said people like darren fletcher top class player playing regular for manchester united and hes got everything you would need for a midfield player
5776250 stephen did really well because a lot of players would have went down as if they had been pole axed
5776251 i can also think of a few who would have been stretchered off before coming back on to resume the game
5776252 but stephen craigan the consummate professional that he is didnt go down and probably saved the lad
5776253 of course we have seen referees give red cards for such an action
5776254 i dont think he should have sent him off but he could maybe warn him or book him
5776255 in the end though my player hasnt overreacted and in doing so has prevented an opponent from being in trouble with the ref
5776256 luckily its not a recurrence of his foot injury but he will miss the next two games at least which is a blow for him and the team
5776257 hes already missed most of pre season and could have done without this latest setback
5776258 i havent been able to announce him mcfadden before thankfully we have done now
5776259 i will be pleased to have a look at him in a scotland shirt on wednesday
5776260 james has ability and talent and you can utilise him in various roles his attacking prowess is his strength rather than in a defensive role but he is capable of producing chances and scoring goals
5776261 miller is another player who has been doing well for scotland and it will be an interesting combination and so we will be looking at that carefully on wednesday
5776262 kenny going back to rangers after being at celtic was never going to be easy
5776263 part of the plot as it said in the script was that this event would be used to start an international war on terror
5776264 aston villa havent accepted a bid from anyone so unless that happens i will do nothing
5776265 if that happens then the final piece of the jigsaw is for me and the player to discuss a move to that club
5776266 i have been contacted by people on behalf of clubs but i have told them if they are interested they have to agree a fee with villa
5776267 if the footage shows any acts of misconduct that were perhaps missed by the match officials we will deal with it
5776268 the footage would have to be clear cut but there have been incidences in the past when players were banned on the strength of video evidence
5776269 tommy is a young lad but he has a responsibility to the club to his team mates and to himself
5776270 it was his first game we had a great support there and the lad was desperate to do well
5776271 ive had a word with tommy and told him he has to channel his aggression
5776272 if he misses games his bank balance will take a knock and he will miss games he is here to play and he has to give himself a chance
5776273 zander felt a tightness in his thigh and didnt want to take any risks
5776274 luckily enough it is not his ankle but it is still a blow to be without him
5776275 he came off at the right time and hasnt made the injury any worse
5776276 i feel i have already improved being down at west brom
5776277 playing with better players improves you and so does the experience of going to places like the emirates
5776278 this is our game in hand effectively and if we win that we would be level with denmark and two points behind finland
5776279 but all we need to do is win the next game
5776280 finland won their first five games and are in a great position
5776281 to finish top we need them to drop points but theres still a lot to play for and the important thing for us is to win our next game

5776285 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5776286 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5776287 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5776288 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5776289 he wants to work and to keep things as they are
5776290 people my friends were saying it would be better for me if spain doesnt win but they are wrong
5776291 if we had lost again there would have been an unbearable atmosphere more doubts and differences we might have been talking about revolution and in football the best thing is continuity
5776292 we are one game away from the gold medal and we cant repeat the mistakes we made in the first half against germany there were lapses in concentration which could be fatal
5776293 weve played brazil before and we know theyre a pretty awesome team with a lot of great personalities but this team player for player is unified and strong and were together
5776294 there are many dead bodies here i think at least 5 other people here have killed someone and locked the body in a box

5776338 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5776339 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5776340 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5776341 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5776342 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5776343 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5776344 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5776345 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5776346 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5776347 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5776348 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5776349 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5776350 who are open to doing something on the production side
5776351 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5776352 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5776353 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

5776368 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5776369 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5776370 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5776371 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5776372 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5776373 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5776374 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5776375 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5776376 the amazing thing to me is that a significant percentage of what ive written has turned out to be valid im one of these guys who gets up at four in the morning after ive handed in a column thinking that i got it all wrong i dont trust myself any more than i trust the politicians i write about

5776385 its especially difficult because it was argentina its difficult to lose at any time but to lose to argentina is a tremendous shame
5776386 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5776387 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5776388 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5776389 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5776390 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5776391 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5776392 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5776393 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5776394 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5776395 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5776396 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5776397 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5776398 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5776399 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5776400 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5776401 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5776402 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5776403 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5776404 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5776405 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5776406 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5776407 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5776408 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5776409 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5776410 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5776411 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5776412 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5776413 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5776414 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5776415 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5776416 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5776417 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5776418 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5776419 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5776420 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5776421 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

5776452 he always struck me as being naturally and philosophically opposed to regulation at the outset and it took an enormous amount of discussion and analysis to convince him otherwise
5776453 i cant think of a case where chase advocated more environmental or health protections
5776454 hes got an incredible amount of authority and a portfolio seemingly without end
5776455 one of the original foot soldiers in the 94 recapture of congress
5776456 chase and others wanted a yes or no decision understanding that the decision to deny or grant the permit is within an agencys discretion
5776457 its not surprising that the bush administration is considering a candidate who has a track record of putting politics ahead of science over and over again appointments like this one have damaged the governments ability to protect the environment and public health
5776458 are these editors serious are they paying any attention to what they are publishing
5776459 however a lot of the old activists stood in the path of an advancement rather than blazing it while democratic black voters embraced obama by ratios of eight or nine to one in a lot of districts the 42 house members in the congressional black caucus for a time split more or less down the middle between obama and clinton
5776460 it is hard for any outsider to fully understand the thinking that led many older black leaders to spurn the candidacy of a man who is now routinely pictured with revolutionaries like angela davis and malcolm x on t shirts sold at the street corner kiosks of black america
5776461 on a surface level those who backed clinton did so largely out of a combination of familiarity and fatalism
5776462 embrace the idea that black politics might now be disappearing into american politics in the same way that the irish and italian machines long ago joined the political mainstream
5776463 he would also initiate the war on poverty a set of federal programs aimed at creating new social service structures that would greatly benefit poor blacks
5776464 may god punish them for the crime they have committed against these youngsters and their country
5776465 once again the algerian people are victims of indiscriminate and barbaric terrorist attacks
5776466 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5776467 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5776468 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look the i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5776469 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5776470 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the gi bill as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but the people of arizona and of all america expect more from their representatives than that and instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5776471 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5776472 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5776473 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5776474 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5776475 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5776476 one may use the radio a cellphone a blackberry bluetooth wireless a slingbox and perhaps a satellite tv feed whether mccain actually used any of those devices we have no idea but he absolutely had the ability to use them which is all that mitchell had reported
5776477 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle

5776483 despite their ineptitude in a lot of other areas and how poor they are at governing one of the things the bush administration has been very good at is using administrative mechanisms to control policy outcomes
5776484 i have worked on regulatory issues inside the beltway since 1976 and have watched five presidents come and go
5776485 the bush administration is the most hostile and aggressive toward these agencies by a couple of orders of magnitude making the reagan era look relatively benign
5776486 no matter who is elected in november it will take years to repair this damage
5776487 politics is injected and elevated into decisions where science and rational judgment should prevail
5776488 politics supersedes scientific and technical information that is critical to protecting our environment and health and safety at home and in the workplace
5776489 many of the politicization scandals in this administration came from cases where unqualified or inexperienced people got into key jobs often with the power to hire others or control information flows
5776490 despite the presidents promise to bring business like thinking to the federal government the bush administration has overseen or at least permitted a significant expansion of both the height and width of the federal hierarchy
5776491 there have never been more layers at the top of government nor more occupants at each layer
5776492 weve been particularly concerned that some of the scientific community is being co opted by political manipulation and that policy is being presented as fact
5776493 the power to coordinate information collection and to review proposed final regulations in a policy office of the white house made omb the equivalent of a political censor over agency actions
5776494 protect his right to select appointees based not only on their managerial prowess but also on their commitment to his policy agenda and their ability to advance articulate and defend it
5776495 one of the things this administration is going to be most known for is that they provided a lot of special access for business interests
5776496 theyve allowed an unprecedented level of involvement by private interests in creating political policy with regard to regulation with regard to rules their energy policy their greenhouse gas policy all of that
5776497 not since oira was created has there been a less appropriate nominee
5776498 dudleys work shows that she is not so much prejudiced against regulation as wary of it
5776499 dudley will bring to the job a wariness of new rules and an expertise in analyzing rules likely effects both of which are appropriate even essential

5776503 we dont need ideological stowaways undermining the work of the next administration
5776504 the history of these issues demonstrates that at some point the pendulum reaches a limit in its rightward swing

5776654 the necessity of critique without a method to distinguish true from false theories investigations of the crime will remain mired in ambiguities the scientific method is the proven method of distinguishing between true and false theories the scientific method depends on critique peer review a culture hostile to critique is antagonistic to science and to the development of a persuasive actionable case for investigation of the crimes of 9 11 01 such a culture supports stereotypes of challenges to the official story as irrational and faith based
5776655 rational critique is discouraged by some within the 9 11 truth movement and

5776677 we wanted to get the details of joseph millbank circulated as far and wide as possible the ceop website will give us access to more people throughout europe possibly throughout the world
5776678 clearly any sightings of joseph millbank or any sightings of his vehicle would be of great value to ourselves in order to track this male down and bring him back to this country and put him back into custody as quickly as possible
5776679 we will not stop at our own borders in trying to locate high risk individuals who may pose a threat to children wherever they may be
5776680 i hope that people will look at his picture and look out for him on their travels
5776681 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
5776682 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
5776683 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
5776684 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
5776685 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
5776686 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
5776687 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
5776688 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
5776689 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
5776690 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
5776691 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
5776692 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
5776693 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
5776694 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
5776695 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
5776696 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
5776697 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
5776698 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
5776699 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
5776700 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
5776701 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
5776702 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
5776703 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
5776704 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
5776705 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
5776706 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
5776707 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
5776708 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
5776709 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
5776710 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
5776711 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
5776712 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
5776713 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
5776714 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

5776721 i wanted to work with the sound of the park itself
5776722 youre encouraged to get up and walk around get different perspectives its not a formal thing
5776723 i grew up right next to the park and spent more than half my life here so i know it inside out its close to my heart
5776724 just the fact that it will be outside the experience of being there will trump whatever ones aesthetic tastes in music
5776725 what about my own contract situation i am just happy playing my football but if anything like that comes about ill be delighted
5776726 ive got this season and two more years left im happy really happy with how things are going happy here at aston villa
5776727 i am just looking to build on the performances of last season during this season and im glad we got off to a good start at the weekend against manchester city
5776728 would i like to commit to a new contract of course it is a fantastic club i am delighted im playing here
5776729 ashley has been fantastic for us and we are in conversation with him over that a new contract
5776730 he hasnt come and asked for anything he has got a number of years left of the deal he signed when he came here to run but id like to sort him out with a new contract
5776731 he is the goalkeeper at chelsea one of the best teams in the world
5776732 i think he has the ability to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world
5776733 everyone has made mistakes it has left him now and i think he is still the best
5776734 i have played three times since last years opening of the new wembley but this will be different
5776735 england dont know the words friendly games every match is equally important and they are deservedly very proud of their team
5776736 it is a test match and now england are playing more technically and with combinations compared to the past
5776737 i was surprised that they didnt qualify for the euros but i think they have a good and strong team and im sure they will qualify for the next world cup
5776738 they play offensive football with quick passes and the names show that they are a very strong team
5776739 hopefully the fans will see to the future that we have a new era after euro 2008

5776767 so far one thing thats very clear is this is very much the group rod wants to go forward with i think that says a lot
5776768 it appears all the coaches and all the players are on the same page and buying into rods system
5776769 we havent had that in the past weve had some talented players but they often were either selfish or didnt buy into what the coaching staff was doing
5776770 a lot of it will depend on how the team does
5776771 late in the season if were in the hunt people are going to want to see us
5776772 this is a thing that happened and you learn from your mistakes
5776773 you always have to take the right steps in everything you do thats life in general i took full responsibility for what happened im here in court everything worked out

5776775 i said to him okay just do your job the decision of course is not just for me but also the board but i think shaun will stay with us he has done a good job till now and the players love him
5776776 we have spent some money on peter crouch so the situation is that we have two other options but shaun wright phillips is a terrific player
5776777 youre always looking for one or two players to improve your squad
5776778 hey admit it or not there are some guys who will kill again if theyre allowed to live you cant hold them in the prisons especially when you have liberal hippies running around unleashed struggling to come up with new excuses every year for releasing criminals from prison
5776779 waitaminnit how can you say killing is wrong and then prove it by killing someone
5776780 when you think about the way people treat each other in africa about witchcraft and people inflicting cruelty and pain on each other then come back here and you know people taking pictures of people when theyre in their homes being taken to hospitals or suffering and selling them getting energy from them thats a terrible infliction of cruelty so whos worse off you know what i mean

5776812 if i challenge any of you to beer pong i just might have you beat
5776813 i am extremely pleased we are thrilled we worked very hard and it is a fantastic result
5776814 i need to know where the enemy is i need to know where the civilian population is in order to kill the enemy more efficiently and effectively
5776815 the grand challenge has proven a showcase for the wealth of talent that exists in the uk not just in large defence firms but in universities schools and even garden sheds across the nation
5776816 they have brought fresh exciting ideas to the defence table which could have battle winning applications for our armed forces
5776817 ive always pronounced the english word forte meaning strength or expertise fort but people deride me for it
5776818 these national numbers for chronic lead poisoning are staggering but the percentage of affected children in older urban areas is much much higher than in rural areas or newer cities the blowing soil and dust young children ingest contains large amount of lead from lead paint and leaded gasoline deposited decades ago and from industrial contamination in indianapolis we found high levels of soil contamination many older urban centers have lead poisoning rates that are 5 to10 times the national average
5776819 our review plus the new directions we suggest for remoisturizing soil to prevent blowing of contaminants confirm that our approach to estimating lead burden and its remediation can be done anywhere in the u s where there is a lead concern the environmental protection agency and the u s department of housing and urban have focused their attention on indoor contamination as the direct source of lead to children it is now time to open the door and solve the contaminated soil problem we hope our study will raise awareness and ultimately funding to stop the poisoning of americas children especially those living in older urban areas
5776820 theres no evidence these breaches caused or led to the sinking of the melina and keith ii
5776821 whatever happened after the sinking was not relevant to this case
5776822 although smoking is the overwhelming cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd only 20 percent of smokers develop the disease
5776823 our findings suggest that mycoplasma pneumoniae mp infection may be one of the co factors that lead to copd and other diseases among smokers
5776824 without it all smokers would suffer significantly more lung damage
5776825 the mycoplasma infection completely blocked the protective response mice normally mount against tobacco smoke reducing antioxidant levels well below even those of mice breathing fresh air
5776826 the mycoplasma infection blocked the lungs protective response to tobacco smoke by lowering levels of the enzyme that normally recycles oxidized glutathione back into its protective reduced form
5776827 this resulted in severe oxidative stress and increased tissue damage as measured by oxidized dna

5776834 my bubble of enthusiasm for presidential politics was really deflated
5776835 some people might get discouraged from getting involved because they really believed in him and he let them down
5776836 there is a feeling that it was very selfish of him to pursue the presidency knowing that this skeleton was in his closet
5776837 the democratic party would be in a very tough position now if john edwards was our nominee
5776838 finally a politician who had compassion for the plight of the middle class who was not tied to washington and big corporations
5776839 now the people wont remember the programs he put forward theyll just remember now that he had an affair when his wife was so sick
5776840 if edwards had not been in the iowa caucuses its very likely that hillary would have won
5776841 he was saying that while he knew very well what was going on in his own life
5776842 i didnt expect him to be so caught up in himself its not just the affair its the cover up we dont know the truth
5776843 but theyre a lot more angry at george w bush than they are at john edwards or the national enquirer or anybody else
5776844 we all call him bobby but the world calls him bob
5776845 were just watching every minute watching phelps swim which is great and of course we love to catch a glimpse of bobby on tv
5776846 its a nice feeling to know that hes part of the family
5776847 he couldnt believe that bobby was my nephew coaching michael phelps
5776848 the first meet he went to he wasnt assigned to swim there was a free lane and he asked his coach to let him swim and he won
5776849 neither of us knew what in the world he meant
5776850 we had never been around any year long swimming but we found out
5776851 he says hes a much better coach than he was a swimmer
5776852 with music or swimming or trying to make his as in school
5776853 we just accepted the fact that he was always going to be somewhere else
5776854 i remember him saying that there was a little kid in the group below his that could really swim
5776855 bobs had a big part to play in michaels life
5776856 he and michael went for years and never took a day off
5776857 we spent christmas with him one time in baltimore and we went to the pool and worked out while they swam on christmas day they figured theyd have a practice in that somebody else wouldnt
5776858 if theyd ever been with a guy over 40 and if they wanted to and discussed watching x rated movies with them
5776859 we are not aware of any misconduct or suspicion of misconduct when he was on the job
5776860 rick had been involved with monroe swim team for many years both as a parent of swimmers and as a coach
5776861 the board never had any complaints or concerns from parents or swimmers regarding rick and we are all shocked by the allegations
5776862 if our proposal is approved we can begin to create a blueprint for a sustainable energy future
5776863 our company needs to more fully embrace energy efficiency and capitalize on energy efficiency as a zero emissions fifth fuel
5776864 ive got plenty of energy left and they certainly do too
5776865 we think we can cause some changes and create some innovative interesting things
5776866 i dont really want to go to work for anybody anymore
5776867 this allows me to do what i want to do
5776868 completely different type of a deal that nobodys seen before
5776869 i havent figured out exactly what im going to run on it
5776870 we can do stuff like that again that was my baby from the start
5776871 i enjoy the mechanical as much as the promotion end
5776872 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
5776873 women play a central role in the provision management and safeguarding of water and sanitation and must be involved in all water related development efforts
5776874 the united nations general assembly also stressed the need to involve women in all water related development efforts in many cultures women are the guardians of water they need to be able to participate more meaningfully in decision making on how water is used and managed so that their countries can make full use of their knowledge skills and contributions

5776882 my bubble of enthusiasm for presidential politics was really deflated

5776889 but theyre a lot more angry at george w bush than they are at john edwards or the national enquirer or anybody else
5776890 i was in the womb when all of that was going on
5776891 i grew up in a different era this is sports its never been a political statement on my end i don t agree with everything that our government does and i don t agree with everything the russian government does
5776892 you re going to look down at any roster and see two or three americans
5776893 they treat us very good we have personal drivers everywhere we want to go they take good care of us i m not shocked that people are going over there for the kind of money that they re throwing at the girls
5776894 if my story has motivated just one little girl on american or russian soil to dream big and go after it to me its all worth it
5776895 we know shes going to be there you guys know shes going to be there
5776896 shes playing for russia right now and like the rest of that team that makes her the enemy
5776897 we were watching television and we heard the storm come and the lightning
5776898 it was a really loud thunder bolt and we heard a crash and saw a fire ball come in through the kitchen
5776899 saw that there was smoke upstairs in the house so we grabbed her and ran out and got everybody out ok and called the fire department
5776900 it lit up the whole room kids were jumping we werent sure what was going on
5776901 the damage was in the attic and in one of the bathrooms upstairs
5776902 we have such a great neighborhood we had several people offer
5776903 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
5776904 the bush epa went out of its way to overturn a system that required states to adequately monitor air pollution at power plants and factories instead epa actually outlawed states from requiring monitoring good enough to protect the health of their citizens epas consistent polluter biased practices have amounted to industry foxes having a house party in the henhouse
5776905 requires that e very one of the permits issued to large factories and power plants must require adequate monitoring and that epa had failed to
5776906 today the court slapped down epas see no evil approach to the clean air act which would have eliminated emissions monitoring required by law responding to an outstanding argument by earthjustice the court understood that emission standards that arent monitored can never be enforced todays opinion is only the latest in series of decisions that have thoroughly rejected epas seven year campaign to unravel the clean air act
5776907 the federal appeals court held that communities across america have the right to know the amount of air pollution discharged by thousands of industrial sources
5776908 the court reinstated bedrock public health protections undermined by what it properly called an epa about face and sharply admonished the agency to carry out the nations clean air laws
5776909 public health should be a top priority not polluters profits
5776910 todays decision will give states back the tools they need to hold polluters accountable and help ensure that everyone has clean healthy air to breathe
5776911 deserved the support of people everywhere who care for justice and freedom
5776912 sure why do we have bases in the middle east we totally violated the rights of that country why do we get to have bases in the middle east
5776913 good thing we dont have to spend the night with the lights on the sheets are so loud wed never be able to get to sleep
5776914 this magazine has been in this room for thirteen years can you believe that
5776915 if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother
5776916 i understand that raising children is universally difficult and that people read an article hoping for something worthwhile in it the truth is i am not on some inside track i have no incredible revelations to share
5776917 confidence intelligence and goodness theres nothing sexier than that combination
5776918 ive never had good habits or a formula for how to shape a day a month a life i appreciate anything that makes me focus
5776919 his rise from obscurity to international stardom his universally acknowledged gifts as a supreme sportsman and his hollywood lifestyle all have the elements of an aspirational fable
5776920 we know in new jersey thats not exactly how the makeup goes
5776921 even if we take it at its face value i think it shows again that we have a governor whos got some significant problems here we are 14 months from his reelection and hes barely scraping 45 of the vote thats not a good place to be as an incumbent and its as a direct result of the way hes conducted himself in office
5776922 the decisions hes made the taxes hes raised failure to improve the economy sweetheart insider deals like youre now seeing with former gubernatorial aide gary rose
5776923 zogby is not going to fudge results because of whos paying the contract otherwise it really denigrates their name if theyre just doing this as a gun for hire part of it is they need to be accurate
5776924 i think that is what governor corzine and his campaign staff will be looking at because those are the voters that gov corzine will be targeting in negative campaigning
5776925 jon corzine is in trouble since most new jersey voters say they dont know a lot about christopher christie gov corzines record and inability to unscramble the states budget mess is pulling him down
5776926 i think it speaks as much to the way people get information in new jersey as to anything else and if you were to put him up against assembly speaker joe roberts for example in name identification chriss is probably 3 4 times what robertss is
5776927 lets put it this way corzines not going to have it looks like at this point an easy reelection bid and if christie is running against him of those people who know christie it looks like he can give him a run for his money
5776928 but at this point you dont have a really good picture of that because of the high percentage of people who dont have any impression or knowledge of christie
5776929 de russen stelden een ultimatum ofwel een ruil ofwel zou tbilisi aangevallen worden

5776933 im rei en haben wir beim gewicht etwas zu hoch gegriffen
5776934 bei einer solchen grenzlast macht der linke daumen etwas auf und dann geht auch die hand auf
5776935 eigentlich konnte mir nichts besseres passieren oft bin ich mit dem kopf schon beim dritten versuch das ist ein riesenfehler
5776936 this record is the history of my town its the history of my family and friends in this town
5776937 i really should leave some blogs for my well deserved recipients to nominate
5776938 there are emotional ties with ronny that go beyond basketball
5776939 i think that makes it difficult i think organizations that draft players who turn out to be good players its hard for them to let go of those players and if you know ronny you know hes a special kid
5776940 while shawne williams was not involved in any arrest or any criminal wrongdoing we are extremely upset and hugely disappointed he once again has put himself in a position that jeopardizes shawnes future as a member of the indiana pacers
5776941 hes not going to be charged he did nothing wrong
5776942 janneros probably one of the higher profile players to go over
5776943 four springs and icarus rise based on the poems in
5776944 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5776945 barack obama has been a very strong champion of equal pay for equal work sen mccain over and over again has opposed the opportunity for pay equity bills to move through congress
5776946 human rights violations and the breach of freedom that are taking in this province
5776947 in its fight against terrorism france has just been struck severely
5776948 heartfelt thanks for the sacrifice that they are making and the commitment that the french are making to help secure afghanistan
5776949 the afghan national army is saying that anytime we get close to them they detonate themselves
5776950 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5776951 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5776952 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5776953 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5776954 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5776955 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5776956 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5776957 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5776958 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5776959 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5776960 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5776961 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5776962 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5776963 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5776964 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it
5776965 we dont want to use this sort of pressure but we also dont want this document to remain a dead letter
5776966 neutral peacekeeping force in georgia because russia is clearly party to this conflict
5776967 russian peacekeepers gt russian peacekeepers have engaged in wanton destruction and this has isolated russia the us has not isolated russia
5776968 the use of force is not a basis to redraw the map of countries around russia
5776969 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5776970 the future of our relations will depend on the concrete actions russia will take to honour the words of russian president dmitry medvedev to abide by the peace plan which is not happening at the moment
5776971 it is now in the hands of russia to take action russia should adhere to the six point plan and russians should go back to their positions on august 6th
5776972 i should add we will certainly not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia the future will depend on concrete actions on the russian side
5776973 which can be seen as the same kind of consultation mechanism we have with our other partner ukraine
5776974 georgia is a sovereign country with a democratically elected government at the moment that principle is not accepted by some
5776975 there was very strong language around the table of the need for russia to honour the ceasefire commitment that its president has undertaken
5776976 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces from georgia back to the august 6th 7th status quo ante
5776977 i am not one that believes that isolating russia is the right answer to its misdemeanours
5776978 we are at risk of entering if there is not a very rapid evolution on the ground into a relationship which will be of a different nature to what it was until now
5776979 such actions seriously complicate the general situation and impede the withdrawal process
5776980 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
5776981 wir w nschen pakistan stabilit t wir wollen dass dort frieden herrscht und die demokratie gest rkt wird

5776983 we look forward to exhibiting shotwatch at the 2008 pga fall expo
5776984 pro shop buyers retailers instructors and avid golfers are discovering the value of shotwatch as an invaluable tool for practice and game improvement so it is our pleasure to display the product at the expo
5776985 renaldo really had no role after we drafted gallinari and with the emergence of wilson chandler his minutes would be nonexistent
5776986 so it really wasnt fair to him to keep him in a spot that he wouldnt play and also gives us an opportunity to clear up a roster spot and move on
5776987 beijing city authorities say they have received 77 applications for demonstrations in the specially designated olympic protest parks but none have been cleared to take place
5776988 majority of australians think the country is taking too many refugees
5776989 for every athlete it is like a dream to participate in the olympic games especially for us because basketball in iran is not that important
5776990 everyone is looking for you and taking care of you
5776991 un rinnovato clima di fiducia e complicit tra capitale e lavoro che consenta di cementare una alleanza strategica tra gli imprenditori e i loro collaboratori
5776992 the basis for our leave to appeal is that the case is of national importance that there are some significant flaws in mr justice blairs logic with the greatest of respect and that there is a senior appellate court that takes a different view of the matter than the ontario court of appeal

5777007 its about completing the task of living with enough spontaneity to splurge some of it on bystanders to share with others working through their own travails a little of your bonus life
5777008 it was a beautiful model but there were parts of it that didnt add up and those parts directly conflicted with the model published in 2001

5777010 dish network deeply regrets the disruption of service but prior to the loss of goltv the network refused to offer to negotiate a fair and reasonable price for continued carriage
5777011 we are working hard to negotiate a fair contract with goltv
5777012 but we must also protect our customers from unreasonable demands we take pride in offering consumers the best value for pay tv service in the industry and we remain committed to keeping our cost structure low to the benefit of our customers

5777020 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
5777021 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
5777022 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences

5777042 considering we tried to sell bejeweled outright to more than one industry giant back in the early days of our company and got no takers even after reducing our asking price to 60 000 this little game has done all right for itself
5777043 i vividly recall prospective buyers telling us its not even a game while showing us the door
5777044 it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing
5777045 this is not about one country versus another the chinese have been fabulous its about one routine versus another
5777046 if theres an olympic record for looking like youre not trying hes won that as well

5777050 if theres an olympic record for looking like youre not trying hes won that as well
5777051 what it comes down to bob costas is that the people on the floor judges have to follow the rules
5777052 i think that they dropped the ball on this one the judges
5777053 this is not about one country versus another the chinese have been fabulous its about one routine versus another and i thought that the one girl wearing the red white and blue was definitely better today
5777054 it should not have gotten to that point a tiebreaker
5777055 she should be waving to an olympic gold medalist on the uneven bars and that is my very strong opinion
5777056 the problem is you end up with judges that arent that experienced
5777057 the one that really jumps out at me is the australian judge that took a full point from nastia liukin and only 07 for he kexin
5777058 this is adding to the already brewing controversy and frustration in the heart of the athletes including the viewers

5777060 our wood bodied controller is inspired by the image of our favorite guitars
5777061 we always aim to give the electronic musician and video artist an instrument they can appreciate just as much as a musician appreciates a custom guitar

5777063 hemos hablado con gente muy mayor que ha sufrido estados de esclavitud hasta los a os 90 gente que estaban al servicio de los terratenientes no ten an derechos eran maltratados hemos visto fincas recuperadas por las comunidades zapatistas desde 1994 y la instalaci n de nuevas poblaciones la extensi n de fincas recuperadas es de 600 000 hect reas en todo el estado de chiapas
5777064 uno de los ejemplos de dignidad mayores que hay en este planeta
5777065 hemos visto un avance de los niveles de educaci n de salud de descenso de la mortalidad infantil y de la mujer
5777066 hay intereses econ micos muy serios de recursos energ ticos proyectos de ecoturismo e interesa desplazar a esta gente como sea pero est n resistiendo
5777067 se trata de una verdadera democracia los sistemas de participaci n democr tica son absolutos es decir son sistemas rotativos de representatividad se respetan todos los acuerdos de las asambleas y se rota en la gesti n del gobierno
5777068 existen proyectos de ecoturismo por parte del gobierno estatal que afectar an a territorio zapatista y podr an generar estos desplazamientos de las comunidades
5777069 se est vendiendo territorio a empresas privadas transnacionales como coca cola en un cerro en el que hay zonas de manantiales que pertenecen al territorio zapatista y que han sido vendidas a esta multinacional impidiendo el acceso de las comunidades a su agua no tienen posibilidad de acceder a ese manantial por lo que actualmente se abastecen s lo del agua de lluvia no tendr n agua en poca de sequ a cuando disponen de ella en su propio territorio
5777070 hemos escuchado testimonios de intento de compra de campesinos ind genas para que abandonen el proyecto de construcci n de la autonom a zapatista pero los zapatistas no se venden no claudican ante gente que quiere comprar su voluntad y su energ a y fuerza para construir lo que creen leg timo
5777071 los intentos de compra de campesinos la entrega de territorios zapatistas y los intentos de confrontaci n son las excusa perfecta para la intervenci n del ej rcito y justificar as la represi n
5777072 se puede comprobar que es posible vivir de otra manera todos son personas e importa la opini n de todos
5777073 se han desarrollado programas de salud y educaci n que est n proporcionando educaci n ha descendido la mortalidad infantil tienen escuelas de primaria en casi todas las comunidades est n trabajando en el proyecto de universidad aut noma zapatista etc

5777081 if only we could offer a single chip solution at 399
5777082 we have got nothing against gx2s and recently we just had another gx2 with the 9800 gx2 it has its advantages and its disadvantages so i dont know that theres any particular philosophical approach that we take here we just have to look at the market and build the right product we think our approach is the right approach the best approach is to do both if we could offer a single chip solution at 399 it certainly does not preclude us from building a two chip solution at something higher

5777087 iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki has flatly told gen george casey the top american military commander in iraq that he doesnt want more u s personnel deployed to the country according to u s military officials
5777088 that within three to six months our need for the american troops will dramatically go down
5777089 individually most politicians have a deep understanding of the plight of our health system collectively especially at the federal level they are reluctant even afraid of engaging in a meaningful public policy discussion on health
5777090 in canada we pay dearly to keep patients on waiting lists this is illogical preventing patients from getting treatment is not my definition of preventative medicine
5777091 this excluded the growing costs of waiting to see a gp or specialist and it excluded the costs as patients deteriorate and develop chronic severe irreversible damage addiction to painkillers or depression
5777092 the private public rhetoric on health care is a relic of tedious and tiresome propaganda those who relentlessly argue against and demonize the private sector need a reality check
5777093 if our governments are unable to fund the education of the number of doctors we need we must consider alternatives public private partnerships are used in such circumstances to build infrastructure including roads bridges and hospitals
5777094 overall the environment for equity markets remains very difficult as it has now become clearer that we are witnessing a more severe economic slowdown
5777095 the strength in the dollar index has little to do with dollar strength but more the weakness of the other currencies
5777096 the markets focus is just very one sided at the moment the market has decided to focus on the weakness of the euro zone and hasnt taken a balanced view of risks in the u s
5777097 it is horrifying the incident further shows that violence in south african schools is a real problem and people especially parents are worried about it
5777098 it is an extreme situation also underlying the general problems facing our youth problems of identity confidence in the future abuse of drugs and breakdown of familys moral system
5777099 gwyneth paltrow wont be the apple of her daughters eye if she flaunts the skins of once beautiful animals
5777100 promoting an industry that electrocutes animals snaps their necks and skins them alive is a shocking example to set for a young child

5777104 while governments and the police can discourage speeding and drink driving through education and enforcement its impossible to legislate against absent mindedness
5777105 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in
5777106 the lifestyles of working professionals stay at home parents and even secondary and tertiary students is such that when they get in their car they have a tendency to go into auto pilot leaving them free to focus on everything else that is happening in their lives when they should be thinking about their driving
5777107 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5777108 theres a bit of a down draft from what happened in the us overnight and commodities are a bit weak too
5777109 the chinese stock markets steep losses since the olympics began are also denting sentiment towards heavy industry such as steel makers and shipbuilders there are worries the chinese economy may not grow as robustly after the olympics

5777115 the grand challenge has proven a showcase for the wealth of talent that exists in the uk not just in large defence firms but in universities schools and even garden sheds across the nation
5777116 they have brought fresh exciting ideas to the defence table which could have battle winning applications for our armed forces

5777121 what about the security concerns of the protesters they want to secure the bill of rights they want to secure peace and an end to foreign occupations they want to secure themselves from arrest for bullsh t crimes i guess these are the rare cases where the freedom to tyranize trumps security
5777122 federal and local authorities are girding for huge protests mammoth traffic tie ups and civil disturbances
5777123 the city said they couldnt disclose information because the secret service wouldnt tell the city their plans
5777124 mark cohen testified that the security conditions around the dnc will make demonstrators look like animals in a cage and that the delegates wont hear them
5777125 we are going to file our appeal in the street
5777126 learned that a manufacturer of pepper ball guns had earned a contract with the city because the information was posted on the manufacturers website but the city has refused to say whether the purchase was made
5777127 reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
5777128 they hate our freedoms gee george w was right after all whoops wrong country
5777129 if an organization were to plan to hold hundreds of dogs in those cages the humane society would have to get involved
5777130 the center will have air conditioning water restrooms and medical staff as well as telephones for detainees to reach family and attorneys
5777131 colorado law requires that confidential attorney visits be accommodated at the temporary detention facility as well
5777132 the secret service the pentagon the federal bureau of investigation and scores of police departments are moving thousands of agents analysts officers and employees to denver for the aug 25 28 convention they will operate through a complex hierarchy of command centers steering committees and protocols to respond to disruptions the denver police department will nearly double in size according to federal officials involved in the planning the city is bringing in nearly 1 500 police officers from communities throughout colorado and beyond even inviting an eight person mounted unit from cheyenne wy
5777133 ignoring a city prohibition against the collection of first amendment related intelligence the denver police developed files on 208 organizations and 3 200 individuals the department appears to have continued its surveillance until the fall of 2002 despite the aclu lawsuit monitored groups included the american friends service committee a pacifist quaker group amnesty international and many others with no history of criminal activity documents obtained by the aclu describe how police intercepted e mails recorded the license plate numbers of vehicles at demonstrations and infiltrated advocacy group meetings
5777134 federal and state law enforcement officials in colorado plan to increase intelligence operations during the democratic national convention in denver and run a fusion center where intelligence analysts will collect and analyze reports of suspicious activity civil rights advocates fear the fusion center could enable unwarranted spying on protesters exercising their first amendment rights at the convention
5777135 these centers have very robust police powers and domestic intelligence collecting powers and what weve seen in the past is that when police agencies are given secret powers to spy they abuse those powers and where there is very unclear line of accountability the chances of something bad happening under that system were very high
5777136 meant to facilitate communications between federal state and local law enforcement agencies to share information about quote unquote suspicious activities which can include taking pictures or taking notes the definition is very broad when its defined by them
5777137 one of the precursor behaviors to terrorism thats identified in the order is taking video and we put in our report a couple of instances where people taking video were stopped by police officers simply for taking pictures or video and in some cases particularly where theyre taking photographs or video of police it actually resulted in arrests

5777142 if they attack us we will die thats all we will burn in the crematorium
5777143 had a light and an umbrella with me the police caught me and said i would need a passport i told them that i worked here had been coming to work for a couple of weeks didnt know where to get a passport they told me to speak to my employer to get a hold of the police chief bakshi my cow mooed i said sir thats my cow right there stuck in the sand
5777144 why dont you come to work with us we will all work together
5777145 they tried to cheat us by telling us that we hadnt worked hard enough that we only deserved rs
5777146 we are working and when the movement calls us we go there too stopping work
5777147 if the factory closes then we want land if it goes on we want work there but we will never get work there because we do not have the education the skills or the experience needed
5777148 dont know there must be a channel of work somehow
5777149 first let the government ask us what we want then we can think
5777150 you have to come see what i did with my space
5777151 i was at the star for 20 1 2 years starting in the newsroom as general copy editor mac systems editor final editor of business news and on to indystar
5777152 i think we all knew the layoffs were coming its mostly a surprise it took this long i went through all kinds of emotions after my buyout last summer and found i didnt like not having a job the good news is theres very good life after gannett less stress for sure
5777153 the tough news is it wasnt easy hitting the pavement and looking once i decided i didnt want to be retired but from my experiences i can say the web is the best source many companies require filling out forms on the web anyway for journalists craigslist and mediabistro are good resources
5777154 beyond that anyone laid off should be sure they understand about cobra health insurance and realize that a lot of jobs any more dont include health benefits and of course set up an e mail account at one of the free sites like gmail if you dont have one makes life much easier theres also blogging but thats a really high stress endeavor since theres so much competition to be first with a story and attract advertisers
5777155 gannett i think will survive intact and have time to right the ship on the web since it has a poison pill that would have otherwise caused raiders to snap it up by now and it does have 14 of the internet space the last time i checked so its chances of survival and comeback are pretty good just notthe way it used to be i dont expect it to be broken up like knight ridder which i also worked for
5777156 youre much more interesting to read now that you left the star liberating isnt it
5777157 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3
5777158 there were titles like wario which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased
5777159 we were excited that mr miyamoto made the commitment that pikmin is coming it would have been nice if we could have said that on stage but we think it was a good recognition for us that we care for our core fans and not just the new people who are now discovering nintendo

5777179 he preyed on vulnerable young people and turned them into recruits to his cause using internet chat rooms to lure them in then incite them to fight
5777180 while these men may not have been actively planning acts of terrorism themselves they sought to incite others for terrorist purposes promoting al qaeda ideology and training programs

5777194 ik heb een aanbieding van mijn huidig team silence lotto voor volgend seizoen maar ook een andere ploeg hengelt naar mijn diensten een buitenlandse protourploeg wie dat is kan ik nog niet zeggen er is met die laatste ploeg enkel een mondeling akkoord

5777200 we are the leading premium paper company in north america and with that comes a level of accountability that we have not only chosen to meet but to exceed our whiting mill was an obvious choice for this project because it represents over half of neenahs fine paper production including the companys classic crest r and classic r linen flagship brands
5777201 our commitment to the environment is based on real internal change such as investing in innovative energy efficient upgrades and manufacturing processes versus simply buying carbon credits this project supports that strategy and complements existing initiatives already in place at our other manufacturing sites where we burn biomass and utilize local hydro solar and wind power

5777203 my husband will be retiring in a few years and i can just see us in a place like this pottering about
5777204 while governments and the police can discourage speeding and drink driving through education and enforcement its impossible to legislate against absent mindedness
5777205 drivers need to make better decisions about their fitness to drive whether it be refraining from driving when emotionally charged or consciously taking a break when fatigue sets in
5777206 the lifestyles of working professionals stay at home parents and even secondary and tertiary students is such that when they get in their car they have a tendency to go into auto pilot leaving them free to focus on everything else that is happening in their lives when they should be thinking about their driving
5777207 getting safely from a to b must be the priority for drivers from the time they turn on the ignition to the time they turn it off
5777208 this sort of willingness to get behind the wheel when all the signs say you shouldnt suggests some drivers are either ignorant of the law or just plain stupid
5777209 it is horrifying the incident further shows that violence in south african schools is a real problem and people especially parents are worried about it
5777210 it is an extreme situation also underlying the general problems facing our youth problems of identity confidence in the future abuse of drugs and breakdown of familys moral system
5777211 this is traumatic parents leave their children with us in schools and expect to find them in one piece
5777212 the government must take immediate steps to develop bi lateral cooperation agreements and joint investigations with other countries to return sex offenders to the uk and give clear guidance on when travel bans should be used to protect the worlds most vulnerable children

5777281 the cards battled back against the astros tonight would it be enough
5777282 look for some huge changes in idol next season more about that later
5777283 my heart is still pounding and i have chills up and down my arms
5777284 for weeks now david cook the 25 year old husky voiced rock dude from blue springs missouri has ensured his survival on the seventh season of american idol by taking some fairly memorable pop and r amp b hits and putting his own sometimes unique rock and roll stamp on them
5777285 over the course of the last 10 weeks cook has turned pop standards like mariah careys always be my baby into bona fide rock cuts
5777286 with the exception of michael jacksons billie jean which was a blatant and admitted cop on chris cornells cover of the song cook has been able to take these classics and make them his own
5777287 but i also think hes a really good singer and performer i could definitely see him taking advantage of this nickelback period this is a time where that type of music is doing well and fits quite easily into that world of radio play
5777288 david cook seems to have held onto his credibility about the type of singer he wants to be throughout the competition he hasnt lost any of that if mariah carey week didnt do him in what will the thing is you dont expect to see rock covers of pop songs during idol weve grown accustomed to people belting big songs cook doing something you dont expect to see on the idol stage i think thats given him a real edge
5777289 youll never be lonely if you learn to befriend yourself
5777290 i would advise david to focus on being the kind of singer he is he strikes me as an adult contemporary singer like a josh groban or norah jones who could likely have some crossover success to the pop charts if he tries to put on a show and look like something hes not he will get thrown to the wolves
5777291 the biggest hurdle archuleta seems to have at the moment is his inability to connect emotionally to the material hes singing critics and audiences are starting to question how much this young man wants to be doing what hes doing and how much is an agenda being pushed by a controlling stage dad archuleta is really not cut out for the rock tinged pop music that has become kelly clarksons trademark nor does he fit the musical theater track followed by jennifer hudson and clay aiken id say archuleta from what hes shown us on idol thus far falls into more of a pop balladeer genre perhaps similar to the type of music sung today by josh groban or even the equally breathy john mayer without the sexual overtones id dare say hed also have an exceptionally successful career in christian pop music
5777292 being a mormon isnt the cross to bear that it once was mitt romney got past that in politics even though he dropped out of the presidential race for other reasons and 40 years ago the osmond family navigated a lucrative career as well all david archuleta will need to do is find his own voice and he will do fine if season 2 competitor clay aiken can come out as a winner and say im not going to be the next justin timberlake and still do fine with the right management david archuletas prospects are bright
5777293 as a publicist i see no reason why he cant be a pop icon given he is mormon donny osmond did it and others with strong religious persuasions have done well too like michael jackson with the jehovahs witnesses if i were representing him i would play down anything that might be too controversial or impede his success rather than exploit it my big concern is the stability of his incredible voice he has had past problems and the demands this tour will might be difficult for him but as for religion i dont think that matters besides with jamie lynn spears and lindsay lohan and now miley cyrus in vanity fair david has an edge in coming on the pop scene as someone refreshing and clean just what the public wants
5777294 i have always seen archuleta as a groban aiken type and could easily see him going in that direction doing that type of adult contemporary leaning vocal pop
5777295 next week we would have had to sing three songs
5777296 locarno has an excellent reputation in the tourist and cultural fields

5777314 while lovett says a disease being carried by the varrao is a likely cause of the disappearing bees he cant be absolutely sure
5777315 nobody has carried out the work to see if it is these mites
5777316 vanengelsdorp a sandy bearded 37 year old quickly eliminated the most obvious suspects varroa and tracheal mites which have occasionally wrought damage on hives since the 1980s at the state lab in harrisburg pa vanengelsdorp checked bee samples from pennsylvania and georgia he washed bees with soapy water to dislodge varroa mites and cut the thorax of the bees to look for tracheal mites he found that the number of mites was not unusually high
5777317 the disturbing phenomenon is presently predominantly attributed to the varroa mite in newspapers and periodicals
5777318 in the course of the investigation all previous hypothesis had been ruled out
5777319 other viruses and nosema parasites had been suggested as the cause of ccd but the researchers found that those pathogens appear in both ccd and non ccd samples
5777320 infestations such as the varroa mite can be tested for quickly and easily and could confirm this as the current cause but this has not been reported this time
5777321 it was first discovered in devon in the early 1990s and no one is really sure how it got here
5777322 then three or four years ago we began to realize the treatment we were using for it which was approved for treatment of varroa mites they became resistant to it and strangely that also started in devon
5777323 the english channel has been a good protective element for the uk for some years its a hell of a flight for a bumblebee the most likely thing is someone imported a queen and they normally come with workers and attendants and they probably had the mites
5777324 the viruses dont cause any illness to the varrao but they are the carriers european bees had no exposure to it and no ability to handle it
5777325 nobody has carried out the work to see if it is these mites
5777326 funding for defras bee health program is expected to be unchanged in 2008 2009
5777327 there are currently significant pressures on financing across all areas of the departments work
5777328 the fact that funding for the bee health program has been maintained at the same level over a number of years when other programs have faced major cuts is a positive signal of the importance government attaches to this area of work
5777329 nearly 200 000 and the uk governments national bee unit will be given an additional 90 000 this year
5777330 it is ridiculous to say they havent got the money 8 million is literally small change it is nothing
5777331 this is no time for the government to put at risk the greenest the most effective fertilizer you can get bees

5777344 i was carried to the table seated where i dont belong
5777345 we cant expect to win so many games if you concede three goals and two
5777346 there is definitely some defensive aspects we need to look at weve played quite a lot and were a little bit tired today which was a bit of concern
5777347 our defence really really did a great job in the one against one and two against one situations
5777348 but it was important for us to go two goals up that helped us play calm and smart
5777349 why should it be spoiled unless someone tries to spoil it for me
5777350 im very happy i picked up three gold medals from three championships and as far as im concerned nothing can spoil that
5777351 ohuruogu won her appeal against the boa ban in november in a sports arbitration panel which decided there were mitigating circumstances she had been the first british athlete banned for missing three out of competition doping tests

5777353 im very proud ive worked very hard getting to the championships ive kept my head up
5777354 her coach lloyd cowan said the off track dramas had steeled ohuruogu he said ohuruogu almost felt as if she was locked up
5777355 she gets training in the morning finishes at 12 she goes home she sleeps she doesnt want to see nobody
5777356 to win the world championship last year that showed me she had the mentality
5777357 cowan said the testing procedure did not allow for flexibility
5777358 they could turn up at your house you say youre at the track at 10 and change to go somewhere else and they turn up and dont call you
5777359 all you do is get a letter in the post that you missed a test

5777395 this is all to protect poor muslims from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
5777396 if some copts are angered by the law then why is it that muslims are not
5777397 it is degrading for both religions if lets say a poor christian has to sell his kidney to a rich muslim or a poor muslim has to sell his kidney to a rich christian it is not right for either religion and that is why we made this law so we can stop organ trafficking
5777398 it is not about trying to promote differences between religions but its just to minimize the trade of organs as much as we can
5777399 we all have the same egyptian blood but if the reason for the measure is to end organ trafficking we reject it because it may also occur between believers of the same religion
5777400 we are afraid that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
5777401 could lead to discrimination between a muslim and a christian living in the same country
5777402 is discriminatory since it violates human rights the constitution and national unity
5777403 if organ donations are from the third or fourth degree of the family then there is less of a chance of a trade happening as its not likely that family members will sell organs to each other
5777404 no one really comes up and says they want to donate their organs to other people who are not in their family this happens in the west but in egypt it is mostly the poor people who are desperate and end up selling their organs for money

5777430 the public interest can best be served by getting as much broadband in front of as many people as possible as quickly as possible and ensuring that investment keeps up with demand
5777431 to a large extent this is a matter of taking down the barriers to investment and refraining from erecting new ones
5777432 removing entry barriers to facilitate investment as new york city has recently done in granting a franchise
5777433 forming partnerships and revamping the universal service fund to bring broadband to rural communities
5777434 over taxation of innovation such as we currently see to a disproportionate degree in the wireless industry
5777435 we believe that network and applications providers can and must work together to find solutions that work for the industry and for our customers
5777436 and verizon has taken a leadership role in doing just that
5777437 techniques which in field tests have dramatically reduced network costs and congestion while noticeably improving the performance of the service to the customer

5777440 dynamic industries like ours require flexible solutions that can evolve and adapt to a changing environment not rigid regulatory solutions that are one step behind the marketplace
5777441 weve re engineered the common flashlight into a more powerful tool that will help give professionals and do it yourselfers the vision to do their jobs better
5777442 the difference isnt subtle and we named it daylite for a reason its like bringing a beam of daylight to the job its powered by duracell batteries but its another example of how the company is bringing more than battery innovation to the market
5777443 its important for ford to remain active in hydrogen and fuel cell development as a long term renewable fuel solution
5777444 weve had a lot of great experience with these cars and theyre running quite well
5777445 we expected the fuel cells to be much more problematic under real world conditions but its a credit to our development process that the vehicles have been very robust
5777446 were very satisfied with the fords performance range and overall reliability and were encouraged that the doe is extending the program because much more work needs to be done to advance this technology to commercialization
5777447 having zero emission vehicles like the ford in our fleet ensures that we continue to promote clean transportation
5777448 with continued advancement and rigorous testing of this technology automakers will be in able to produce fuel cell vehicles that compete very effectively with internal combustion engines without compromise to performance safety cost or reliability
5777449 were so much farther ahead than we were on the first generation
5777450 we have better development processes and robust disciplines in the way were doing things
5777451 our fuel cell customers are very interested to know whats next and were looking forward to demonstrating it

5777480 it has been always our position that we support comrade mugabe even if it means going to war we will detain tsvangirai if the talks break down

5777507 im very happy to be back at days where i began behind the scenes in the early 80s its wonderful to be given the opportunity to work with ken corday
5777508 this is about controlling government spending not increasing taxes in new york state and making it less competitive quite honestly than it is right now
5777509 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he appreciated the life he was taking that this was a human being
5777510 i feel now at 53 that i have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is i have changed a lot
5777511 i think that was something the press elaborated on that didnt happen he didnt turn i shot him in the back
5777512 for my conscience sake i felt the lord had told me to plead guilty at that time and i did
5777513 i had been going through some problems and was very confused and i just had dug a big hole for myself and was feeling like a big nothing and a nobody
5777514 it was more about me and not him i was probably mad at myself for my failures
5777515 i just saw his face and it seemed like it all came together the solution to my problem of being confused and feeling like a nobody
5777516 i would become famous i would be something other than a nobody and that was my reasoning at the time

5777520 come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in i needed clothes and you clothed me i was sick and you looked after me i was in prison and you came to visit me
5777521 lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
5777522 i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
5777523 we have been tremendously encouraged by the generosity of both our existing donors and donors giving to us for the first time
5777524 massive natural disasters like these bring out the compassion in people many see them as must give situations recession or no recession its life or death people understand both the urgency of the need and the impact their donation will make thats why were not seeing any signs of donor fatigue among our supporters in fact in the case of myanmar we expect to raise four times what we initially estimated
5777525 depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink i was a stranger and you did not invite me in i needed clothes and you did not clothe me i was sick and in prison and you did not look after me
5777526 alabama quarterback john parker wilson was pretty precise with the ball
5777527 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5777528 were really looking forward to going deep and revisiting not only the songs but also the story
5777529 interestingly enough us going over all the old material seems to be influencing our writing of the next record which were sort of doing simultaneously and to me that seems appropriate since the next story is the prequel to the amory wars
5777530 we had made this car specially for this kind of thing
5777531 once you get in sangsue cant smell you something that addison over there came up with
5777532 ok so that one driving is jackson im oliver and next to you are addison and tanner
5777533 i cant believe this i thought i was the only human left
5777534 well then youll probably go into shock once we get back to base i mean come on do you really think youre the only special human who was able to keep away from those diseases thats just mean
5777535 thats our niche winning the wac is very important for us but being in a non bcs conference we had to do something especially being in the state of california to give us a chance to recruit
5777536 whats the point of difference for fresno well the point of difference for fresno is great hometown fans they play great teams on the road and theyre on tv all the time so that became our point of difference and i think that outweighs the negatives
5777537 when i look back on my college career i want to know that i played the best teams possible the best way to gauge yourself and figure out where youre at is to play against the best thats a barometer for college football so i wouldnt change it at all
5777538 right after the sc game they had already given us our bowl game and we went to reno and nevada just outplayed us and beat us and in the last week of the season we werent physical and louisiana tech came in and beat us not taking anything away from them it just got to the point where i had to do a better job of making sure were ready to play every week
5777539 if we could make money and be successful off of playing that type of schedule then it would be different and we could play it but we cant
5777540 the super bowl is game one because if you lose that game everything you planned for all your hopes and dreams are gone
5777541 i look at it as heres a chance to play some of the best teams in the country and really see how we stack up we talk a big game about wanting to be one of the big boys so we have to back that up and prove that we belong there
5777542 at that point in time i was thinking that this is my chance
5777543 you only get one shot most of the time so when you do get it you have to make the most of it you can only play your best and as hard as you can and i thought i did that looking back on it there are some things i would have done differently but you cant change that now
5777544 kaepernick is as good a quarterback as there is in terms of running the ball and throwing it
5777545 the biggest transition hes going to have to make is from being a thrower to a passer
5777546 my concern with graz is getting him back playing football hes got that linebacker mentality the bulldog part of the offense is fine but the finesse of the offense weve got to get him back into the groove
5777547 just because something happened yesterday doesnt mean its going to happen today ive got to come out and prove to the coaches again that i can play at a high level and get the respect of my teammates again
5777548 i think youve got to get your quarterbacks in a rhythm during a game and you dont want one quarterback looking over his shoulder
5777549 if we feel like the two quarterback system is the way to go and we develop it we develop it id rather not be in that capacity what id like to be in though is when your offense is sputtering a little bit and you have to pull a guy and you can put the other guy in there and maybe not miss a beat
5777550 what can i say about graz ive never seen a guy come back with so much determination to get his spot back
5777551 in his mind its his spot even though kap ended the season with the honors that he did and theyre both going to make each other better the more competitive it is the better the no 1 is going to get and thats good for us as a team
5777552 i did a terrible thing to you by killing your father who was my neighbor and my friend
5777553 i had even helped prepare the feast when he received confirmation in the church but the evil one invaded my life and i committed this horrible crime of killing your father im falling before you begging for mercy for the crime i committed
5777554 it was meaningless to have you arrested i regret that
5777555 for a murderer to be released from prison to go home he was really going to be shoulder to shoulder with people whose families he killed
5777556 i wanted to depict people in the process of reconciliation rather than tell about a reconciliation that had already happened
5777557 i knew that to have a powerful film you need to show something happening in transition progress being made before the camera
5777558 i feel like im just at the beginning of this thing and the film isnt even formally distributed yet
5777559 he ended up being the key to our entire shoot
5777560 he would go into the homes of these widows who had lost everything in their lives their children had been slaughtered their husbands had been shot in the head or macheted to death clubbed to death
5777561 he would listen to their story and empathize and sometimes he would pray with them and then he would say let me tell you about the muzungus white people im working with
5777562 it ended up being a beautiful shoot because we all just worked so effortlessly together
5777563 when i was in rwanda i really had to kind of shut down in order to move through it whereas my friend my roommate cried through the whole thing and in a way i lived vicariously thought her mourning
5777564 i was sitting there in my dirty shirt and my chacos and my dusty capri pants
5777565 it just confirmed that it was an experience i felt was being divinely led
5777566 the house that was here was demolished by its owner when i pass by this place i get chills and i feel terrified
5777567 i think there are lot of people who say that theyve reconciled but i think what it means is that theyre just not killing each other i think a much smaller number a minority that is truly engaged in authentic reconciliation where real healing is happening
5777568 i think you can have practical forgiveness where you say i will forgive you so i can be released from this anger
5777569 but thats not the same as reconciliation forgiveness is simply a giving up of your right to be angry reconciliation goes a step further and is a restoration of the relationship between the person whos been aggrieved and the perpetrator in the case of rwanda i dont think its possible for people to reconcile without a relationship with god
5777570 how can i refuse to forgive when im a forgiven sinner too according to gods word i am called to forgive the killer for i did not create this man
5777571 even my family that he killed i did not create them either his crime was against god who created the people he killed so i placed everything in the hands of god
5777572 i did not believe there could be any deliverance for me
5777573 my greatest hope is that god would use as we forgive to bring about reconciliation on multiple levels in this broken world
5777574 this is the most incredible example of faith and courage and the resiliency of the human spirit that ive ever heard
5777575 and i want people to be transformed by that and to believe that its possible in their own lives if rwandans can forgive those whove slaughtered their own families how much more can we forgive the small offenses in our lives
5777576 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5777577 to be honest i scored two goals and didnt have a very good game last week
5777578 but im not even thinking of anything like that just now
5777579 i will just keep on working hard for hibs and see what happens
5777580 if you think about it neither of them have played a full match for quite some considerable time
5777581 that was their first 45 minutes and they have both come through it okay
5777582 thank you lord for blessing this sinner i dont deserve anything but you blessed this family so much
5777583 a town can only become a cittaslow if the local council makes the application and agrees to adhere to a set of rules developed in italy that require it to consider cittaslow principles on every aspect of council decision making for that town in other words its a way of interfering unduly with council processes

5777609 shes talking and talking meanwhile you have the entire audience waiting almost two hours for the taping to start
5777610 she had the audience prance down the street and then release black balloons some were whining that it was so bad for the environment it was so disorganized people fell over the press outside and almost trampled two little girls tyra was acting like it was a live sporting event instead of the most self indulgent narcissistic crap

5777838 that game in shanghai we were working on a lot of new things trapping the post when we hadnt put it in in practice it was a game we just were ready to get to beijing and start the olympics
5777839 we were looking forward to getting the olympics started now its going to be a different story
5777840 my gut is basically this the first five dont really count
5777841 thats the way were looking at it and the intensity builds up from this point on because weve been talking about being on a mission and there are a lot of things being said and theyre all wonderful but they dont mean a thing if we dont finish the job
5777842 i feel good about the way our team has been approaching each of the games and thats something weve been trying to instill take nothing for granted no one for granted and so far weve maintained that but i really do believe we all understand that the focus is all funneled down now to three games
5777843 when you get into these moments its when you see great things happen and im hoping we can do that not just win but play at such a high level that we cant lose
5777844 youll see something different from an opponent that you havent seen in an exhibition or in pool play and we need to be prepared for that but maybe theyll see something in us too thats different and thats the excitement

5777875 the biggest challenge facing a young journalist in todays media is
5777876 wij zijn heel blij met deze onverwachte overwinning wij zeilen normaal enkel olympische banen en daarom is het de eerste keer dat we aan dit belgisch kampioenschap lange afstand deelnemen na een matige start in oostende konden we tijdens het opkruisen op de weg naar nieuwpoort toch al snel naar een tweede plaats zeilen toen we middelkerke bereikten eenmaal op de terugweg van nieuwpoort naar blankenberge hadden we het echter een stuk moeilijker onder spinnaker en sloegen we terug naar de derde plaats in het laatste stuk van blankenberge naar oostende viel de wind weg en werd het echt zoeken naar stroken met een zuchtje wind het is pas in de laatste kilometer dat we erin slaagden om de leiding over te nemen
5777877 wij waren al van in het begin niet in de wedstrijd na een matige start rondden wij pas als achtste de eerste boei en waren wij constant op achtervolgen aangewezen in blankenberge hadden wij al meer dan 6 minuten achterstand op de leider toch slaagden wij er nog in om in het laaste stuk de schade te beperken en naar een vierde plaats terug te komen
5777878 wij hebben vanaf de start tot 1 km voor de finish ruim op kop gevaren op bepaalde momenten zelfs met meer dan 4 minuten voorsprong op de tweede deelnemer door het wegvallen van de wind op het einde vielen we zelf volledig stil en konden de achterlopende boten langs het windloze stuk omzeilen en ons zo voorbijgaan op dat moment kun je niet meer reageren en dit leidde wel tot de nodige frustraties op de boot
5777879 ook aan de kant was er spektakel te beleven voor de eerste keer in belgi was het mogelijk om dank zij het gebruik van mobiele technologie aan ieder checkpoint de wedstrijd live vanop de kant en het internet te volgen tien deelnemers kregen zelfs een gps mee waardoor hun positie permanent werd doorgegeven en op satellietbeelden geprojecteerd fans en vrienden van de deelnemers konden zo de positie van hun favoriet constant volgen zonder zelf op het water te moeten zijn het was de eerste keer dat deze oplossing voor een zeilwedstrijd in belgi werd ingezet en met succes met deze technologie trachtten we om de mensen dichter bij de watersport en meer specifiek het wedstrijdzeilen te betrekken
5777880 we hebben een heel mooi en spannend kampioenschap gehad we hadden de luxe te beschikken over een internationaal deelnemersveld van dertig teams met verschillende nationale en internationale kampioenen wat het niveau bijzonder hoog maakte de krachtige zuidoosten wind zorgde ervoor dat er bijna parallel met de kust kon worden gezeild met snelheiden tot 40 km u zo hebben we ook de bezoekers van de belgische kust het nodige spektakel kunnen geven

5777947 its hard for the existing facilities to address the need
5777948 there will be more alzheimers and other age related dementias we know we are going to need more options as people age

5777953 my corporate goal is to fund an abs building in all of the maritime academies in the u s
5777954 it is our sincere hope that this commitment is the start of what will continue for generations to come here at the academy
5777955 abs wants to be a catalyst for helping to make american maritime colleges the best in the world

5777960 these are not the actions of curious individuals or even those who are sympathetic to terrorist objectives
5777961 he was certainly the youngest ever to be charged with a terrorist offence
5777962 while these men may not have been actively planning acts of terrorism themselves they sought to incite others for terrorist purposes promoting al qaeda ideology and training programmes
5777963 our society is in the midst of a profound technology and communications revolution this so called digital revolution is transforming the nations economic social political and cultural landscapes

5777965 this arrival into boston marks the beginning of our second tour of grassroots organizing adding 18 municipalities to our national reach after having successfully established councils in five other major metropolitan areas
5777966 the key to expanding opportunities for all communities is through digital empowerment
5777967 educating communities about the value of broadband technology and pursuing policies at all levels of government that ensure equal access to cutting edge technologies products and services that can empower all communities regardless of race ethnicity or income
5777968 as i crossed the line i was thinking oh my gosh i think ive won

5777970 we got the customers out and checked the toilets on the first floor there was thick smoke everywhere
5777971 the fire is in ducting between the floors firefighters are being hampered by plasterboard ceilings which weve had to break through
5777972 weve smashed a number of windows on the first floor to vent smoke and heat out of the building to make it easier to work in
5777973 were checking that the fire hasnt spread to adjoining buildings
5777974 it is a major step to go from a bag system to three bins in one go we felt it was needed

5777976 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5777977 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5777978 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation
5777979 for the u s arguably the top priority is border control between pakistan and afghanistan but these two go together

5777986 what kind of person would use that kind of language about someone like harry teague tinsleys democratic opponent who has been well known and well respected in the district for decades
5777987 i dont know mr tinsley maybe the same way you can talk about how you can conjure up the image of your own kin getting their throats cut just to score points in a political campaign
5777988 to its credit the crowd booed so vigorously the rest of mr tinsleys exploitation of his nephews could not be heard

5777990 zoom from the little dfnm blog in out of the way new mexico to the nations tv screens in less than 24 hours there really is nowhere to hide in this election cycle
5777991 in april it was reported that the fbi had been focusing on as many as four suspects
5777992 confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
5777993 i was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described the tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years this is not spin this is not true
5777994 the fbi has completely shut congress out of its investigation into anthrax attacks on capitol hill and around the nation
5777995 scientists in and out of government say the rush to destroy the spores may have eliminated crucial evidence about the anthrax in the letters sent to congress and the media
5777996 this was an astonishing thing to do it should have been preserved as evidence this was a roadmap of everybody and anybody that had gotten access to develop the super strain that hit leahy and daschle
5777997 fbi scientists early on had but destroyed the unique strain of anthrax used in the deadly 2001 attacks that years later would lead them to dr bruce ivins this was anthrax that ivins took from his army lab in february 2002 and gave investigators
5777998 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged

5778000 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
5778001 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
5778002 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5778003 the strong performance of autotrader com for two consecutive years is founded on its most notable strengths the quality of leads and the amount of contact with the dealership both of which are especially important to dealers
5778004 cars com has been steadily improving in the used vehicle lead segment rankings during the past two years so it is not surprising that the service improves from its second rank position in 2007 to earn the highest rank in 2008
5778005 as both new and used vehicle sales decline it is now more important than ever for dealers to cast as wide a net as possible toward the limited supply of vehicle shoppers which is one reason why dealers are increasing their use of online lead providers in the hopes of generating more traffic and sales for their dealerships
5778006 also dealers use vehicle lead notification systems to try to differentiate themselves from their competitors through faster lead response times in this highly competitive industry creating even a slight edge over other dealers is critical during a period of slow sales
5778007 but there is no reason in principle that they should be any more legally vulnerable than google youtube of course thats no guarantee that they wont be sued

5778021 it is notable then that mccain is doing only about as well among military veterans as bush did in 2004 despite the two republican candidates varying military backgrounds
5778022 van business as usual kan onder de huidige omstandigheden geen sprake zijn
5778023 de toekomst van onze betrekkingen zal afhangen van de concrete stappen die rusland zet om gevolg te geven aan de woorden van president dmitri medvedev dat het zespuntenplan voor vrede zal worden uitgevoerd hetgeen op dit moment niet gebeurt
5778024 we zijn zeer teleurgesteld want ondanks de aan ons gedane belofte is er geen sprake van een troepenterugtrekking
5778025 wij willen niet zulke druk gebruiken maar we willen ook niet dat dit document de vredesovereenkomst een dode letter blijft
5778026 well it doesnt matter now that was so long ago
5778027 things were different back in the old country none of that makes any difference anymore
5778028 this imaging modality allows us to see things weve never been able to see before
5778029 we shine light on a nanotube and listen to the ultrasound waves coming out of it
5778030 we will be able to ask a tumor are you responding to chemotherapy or not
5778031 this should give us early information long before the tumor shrinks or grows
5778032 in order to fashion an extremely standardized and thus safe gospel culture impose restrictions well into the realm of the acceptable
5778033 if we have free will so do subatomic particles mathematicians claim
5778034 this week last year was the peak of the driving season and was the highest volume week in all of 2007
5778035 maybe when you see prices come down further youll start to see another tipping point where people will start to change their behavior
5778036 it doesnt seem as though weve hit a price threshold thats really going to stimulate a behavior change yet
5778037 we started this conversation with policymakers and the american public in 2000
5778038 weve significantly turned up the volume on that conversation in the last year
5778039 clean coal means the next president wont have to choose between the economy and the environment
5778040 in the name of the king a dungeon siege tale
5778041 string that boy up from the tallest tree in the county
5778042 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5778043 we won a massive victory in a few weeks and we did so with very limited loss of american and allied lives we were able to end aggression with minimum overall loss of life and we were even able to greatly reduce the civilian casualties of afghani and iraqi citizens
5778044 well then why was there a banner that said mission accomplished on the aircraft carrier look i have said a long time that reconstruction of iraq would be a long long difficult process but the conflict the major conflict is over the regime change has been accomplished and its very appropriate
5778045 senator obama commits the greater error of insisting that even in hindsight he would oppose the surge even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5778046 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5778047 as a political proposition it would have much easier for me to have just signed on to what i considered flawed legislation but the people of arizona and of all america expect more from their representatives than that and instead i sought a better bill im proud to say that the result is a law that better serves our military better serves military families and better serves the interests of our country
5778048 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president
5778049 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded ten days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5778050 mccain may not have been in the cone of silence
5778051 may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5778052 the fact is that during senator obamas segment at saddleback last night senator mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5778053 one may use the radio a cell phone a blackberry bluetooth wireless a sling box and perhaps a satellite tv feed
5778054 this is irresponsible journalism and sadly indicative of the level of objectivity we have witnessed at nbc news this election cycle

5778080 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5778081 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5778082 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5778083 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5778084 this was an evolutionary change to the microsoft licensing that everyone expected

5778111 corporate strategy is all about collecting information from many different sources evaluating the probabilities of potential outcomes and making decisions in the face of an uncertain future
5778112 diversity helps because it actually adds perspectives that otherwise would be absent and because it takes away or at least weakens some of the destructive characteristics of group decision making
5778113 the important thing about groupthink is that it works not so much by censoring dissent as by making dissent seem somehow improbable
5778114 fostering diversity is actually more important in small groups and in formal organizations
5778115 diversity is on its own valuable so that the simple fact of making a group diverse makes it better at problem solving
5778116 groups that are too much alike find it harder to keep learning because each member is bringing less and less new information to the table
5778117 when decision makers are too much alike in worldview and mind set they easily fall prey to groupthink
5778118 the more personal contact they have with each other the less likely it is that the group decisions will be wise ones

5778122 right at the beginning of understanding media he tells us that a medium is any extension of ourselves classically he suggests that a hammer extends our arm and that the wheel extends our legs and feet each enables us to do more than our bodies could do on their own in other words a medium this extension of our body or senses or mind is anything from which a change emerges and since some sort of change emerges from everything we conceive or create all of our inventions innovations ideas and ideals are mcluhan media
5778123 ausweitungen des menschlichen k rpers die das menschliche handeln optimieren bzw ersetzen
5778124 mcluhan tells us that a message is the change of scale or pace or pattern that a new invention or innovation introduces into human affairs mcluhan p8 note that it is not the content or use of the innovation but the change in inter personal dynamics that the innovation brings with it
5778125 die erfindung des buchdrucks und die hieraus resultierende massenhafte produktion von b chern f hrte zu einem enormen bildungsschub in allen gesellschaftlichen schichten die lateinische sprache wurde in westeuropa durch nationalsprachen abgel st auch sei die stereotype aneinanderreihung von gedruckten buchstaben das embryonalstadium des fliessbandes und der massenproduktion gewesen der buchdruck implizierte ein streng lineares denken buchstabe an buchstabe zeile f r zeile in der typographie sah mcluhan die erste mechanisierung eines handwerks f r mcluhan ist die botschaft des buchs also nicht was es dem leser inhaltlich vermittelt sondern welche auswirkungen es auf individuum und gesellschaft hat insofern verwendet er den begriff botschaft gleichbedeutend mit wirkung
5778126 he pointed to the light bulb as a clear demonstration of this concept
5778127 a mcluhan message always tells us to look beyond the obvious and seek the non obvious changes or effects that are enabled enhanced accelerated or extended by the new thing
5778128 this is merely to say that the personal and social consequences of any medium that is of any extension of ourselves result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves or by any new technology
5778129 thus we have the meaning of the medium is the message
5778130 whenever we create a new innovation be it an invention or a new idea many of its properties are fairly obvious to us we generally know what it will nominally do or at least what it is intended to do and what it might replace we often know what its advantages and disadvantages might be
5778131 the medium is the message tells us that noticing change in our societal or cultural ground conditions indicates the presence of a new message that is the effects of a new medium
5778132 with this early warning we can set out to characterize and identify the new medium before it becomes obvious to everyone a process that often takes years or even decades
5778133 and if we discover that the new medium brings along effects that might be detrimental to our society or culture we have the opportunity to influence the development and evolution of the new innovation before the effects becomes pervasive
5778134 as mcluhan reminds us control over change would seem to consist in moving not with it but ahead of it

5778239 centrism is the philosophy of the american media and that essentially backs the status quo when youre a centrist and this game of objectivity that they play is really limited by parameters that youre allowed to ask questions and to investigate and in a sense then youre transmitting these assumptions and reinforcing every day that the us is really a functioning democracy

5778473 we in canada have understood over the past several years how difficult this mission is
5778474 we of course are very proud to have the french making an enhanced contribution in afghanistan

5778485 i think were going to all enjoy a nice summer day
5778486 three days with john is like three months with another gymnast
5778487 team coordinator ron brant told me that nobody ever puts in a new routine during the olympics and hits it but ive been working with john four years and once i saw him doing it in practice we were very comfortable putting it in
5778488 then id do the other half later it was too tiring to do all at once but ive done every one of those skills before just never all together in a single routine i trust myself go big or go home thats my motto
5778489 if id stuck my landing i might have had a different color medal
5778490 but i cant complain this was my first event final and i just had fun with it im a daredevil and i just went crazy
5778491 hell come back and say but ive got two gold
5778492 but having nine olympic medals in the family is pretty cool it was so great to be able to share this experience with my dad it made it more than a dream come true its a little sad now we trained our entire lives for this moment and its over like a flash
5778493 she proved that over and over at these olympics shawn tumbles on the beam like anyone else on the floor and its hard to figure out why the judges kept holding back her marks
5778494 i did seven beam routines in the afternoon and i kept making very uncharacteristic mistakes
5778495 it was just fatigue my coach liang chow was getting nervous and he finally told me to stop to take a second and gather myself so i sat down and settled myself down then i did one good routine before we went out once i was on the beam in the competition i felt calm and just let myself go i didnt worry about the score or the placement i knew in my heart what i deserved
5778496 to get a gold in my favorite event its the perfect ending

5778498 this past may matts inspection found the tower was approaching poor condition due to its age and harsh environment the new tower supports our 3 element steppir yagi with a newly installed 40 30 meter dipole kit recently donated by steppir antenna systems hq staff can now enjoy these additional bands and have peace of mind with the new tower
5778499 i am pleased to report that the w1hq tower replacement and installation of the 40 30 meter dipole element on the steppir antenna was successful hq hams may now enjoy a rotating dipole for these bands at the push of a button on the steppir controller the crew from xx towers did a fine job thanks to his regular inspections we were able to avoid a more costly removal of the 50 foot 35 year old tower arrl building manager greg kwasowski w1gjk assisted with and arranged for the roofing company to remove part of the roof for the tower base and replacement after tower installation arrl lab manager ed hare w1rfi saved the day with the needed metric hardware many thanks to all involved for the successful replacement of the tower having a rotatable dipole on 30 and 40 meters is a very welcome addition to the station

5778512 ich habe auf meinen reisen nur ein einziges land gesehen das sich nicht gen gend auf das thema bildung konzentriert und das ist das in dem wir uns hier gerade befinden
5778513 i find attractive the arguments of scholars such as stephen macedo who defend an activist supreme court that would
5778514 that caught me off guard and i had no recollection of making so atypical a statement which shook me up even more
5778515 now it would seem to me what you were talking about
5778516 is you find attractive the fact that they are activists and they would like to strike down existing laws that impact on restricting the use of property rights because you know that is what they write about
5778517 it has been quite some time since i have read professor macedo but i dont believe that in my writings i have indicated that we should have an activist supreme court or that we should have any form of activism on the supreme court
5778518 but the libertarian argument overlooks the place of the supreme court in a scheme of separation of powers one does not strengthen self government and the rule of law by having the non democratic branch of the government make policy
5778519 it doesnt matter to me whether im confirmed or not but i entered this process with a good name and i want to have it at the end
5778520 but if any of these last two matters come up i will be your biggest defender
5778521 he accused tsvangirai of being unreasonable and told the meeting that he would soon form a government with like minded people and not tsvangirai
5778522 it has been always our position that we support comrade mugabe even if it means going to war we will detain tsvangirai if the talks break down
5778523 mugabe is trying to cheat tsvangirai into believing that he will be in charge but tsvangirai smells a rat
5778524 the economy will plunge to unprecedented levels if these talks collapse
5778525 nebraska wanted me to come in and play quarterback and be part of their experience there in the four years i was at tulsa i think they went to two orange bowls a sugar bowl and maybe even a cotton bowl and johnny rodgers was a heisman trophy winner
5778526 in the four years i was at tulsa we had three losing seasons three head coaches and on probation three of the four years
5778527 i was center field and i was darn good i played short center field and dared a guy to hit it over my head no one ever did i could catch anything
5778528 id tell the left fielder and right fielder just take a break
5778529 thats when i decided to make that commitment to football put all the eggs in that one basket and try to make it as a football player and give up baseball
5778530 but i knew in doing that if i was going to play pro football it wasnt going to be at quarterback
5778531 he finally saw to it to move me but he also says even when i see him nowadays or talk to him on the phone he says youre the reason i got fired at tulsa because i granted you your wish and i would have been better off leaving you at quarterback
5778532 while im watching nebraska doing this im saying why did i choose tulsa
5778533 but i chose tulsa because it fit me it fit my personality
5778534 if you got a pass thrown to you at tulsa as a receiver you better catch it because itd be a while before it comes there again
5778535 in order to compete in the ncaa youve got to know how to compete one way to learn how to compete is to create an atmosphere around your athletic programs that other kids see and want to be part of and i think tulsas doing that now
5778536 were seeing an uptick now but we dont consider this to be more than upward pressure from low prices in the past

5778539 i have said repeatedly that i would have been fully in support of the federal bill that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion
5778540 so for people to suggest that i am somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies common sense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics that we have to get beyond
5778541 senator barack obamas four year effort to cover up his full role in killing legislation to protect born alive survivors of abortions continues to unravel
5778542 senator obamas position in the illinois senate was to oppose any legislation that would protect such innocent life everyone else was clear that the bill addressed infanticide not abortion
5778543 that it was the senator himself who was actually wrong on the facts

5778564 because you have made the lord your refuge and the most high your dwelling place
5778565 do not therefore fling away your fearless confidence for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward
5778566 for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which ive committed unto him against that day
5778567 for this reason we also from the day we heard of it have not ceased to pray and make special request for you asking that you may be filled with the full deep and clear knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom in comprehensive insight into the ways and purposes of god and in understanding and discernment of spiritual things that you may walk live and conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the lord fully pleasing to him and desiring to please him in all things bearing fruit in every good work and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of god with fuller deeper and clearer insight acquaintance and recognition we pray that you may be invigorated and strengthened with all power according to the might of his glory to exercise every kind of endurance and patience perseverance and forbearance with joy giving thanks to the father

5778569 we affirm the gospel invitation as a biblically consistent means to call people to come to christ southern baptists have for most of their existence used the invitation successfully furthermore we affirm the many gospel evangelists pastors and churches who have responsibly used the gospel invitation to the glory of god and the good of his kingdom however we sadly but clearly deny that every use of the invitation has been either responsible or healthy for the kingdom of god therefore we call on all evangelists pastors preachers and churches everywhere to employ the utmost care in offering a public invitation avoiding at all costs manipulative measures that would likely deceive convert congregation or community causing immeasurable blight to the body of christ
5778570 you shall not be afraid of the terrors of the night nor of the arrow the evil plots and slanders of the wicked that flies by day nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness nor of the destruction and sudden death that surprise and lay waste at noonday

5778667 we believe that missile defense is a substantial contribution to natos collective security
5778668 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia
5778669 in fact its just not even logically possible for it to be aimed at russia given how russia could overwhelm it the purpose of missile defense is to protect our european allies from any rogue threats such as a missile from iran
5778670 we have finally got understanding of our point of view that poland being a crucial partner in nato and an important friend and ally of the united states must also be safe
5778671 we agreed this negotiating phase a week ago which was before the events in georgia and because of the u s calendar there was some urgency

5778706 last year fars news agency was visited by several journalists and media people from turkey they demanded fars which they said has proved to be a brilliant news agency in the region to start a turkish desk
5778707 consolidation and expansion of islamic unity and solidarity will be on the agenda of the turkish desk of the fars news agency similar to other desks
5778708 and we strongly believe that promotion of islamic values moving toward forming islamic civilization and islamic world are possible only through the unity and solidarity of all islamic groups and sects
5778709 biden voted for the iraq war but beyond that even if we stipulate that he has foreign policy chops how does that make him a good veep choice it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws
5778710 is serious about the possibility of a pro choice vp nominee
5778711 is mccain going to screw conservatives again wouldnt put it past him would you
5778712 biden is not a reinforcing choice as he has served in the senate for 36 years and supported the war back in 2002 2003 in two key ways iraq judgment and change election that is very much the opposite of barack obama and could muddle his message still when it comes to ideological leanings and campaign ability biden is a preferable choice to bayh and kaine as a campaigner while biden is often criticized online as never finding a camera he didnt think should be filming him he is very familiar on the national stage with the national media and is a strong debater he is also a good attack dog and you shouldnt have to worry about him falling down in that category maybe my support for biden is mainly a testament to how poor the crop of potential candidates is than anything else after all being preferable to evan bayh isnt really saying much of at all
5778713 on the one hand its not the most exciting choice biden doesnt bring a state delawares going to go democratic biden also occasionally says something really whacked which well probably find out more of if hes the pick on the other hand wholly separate from the cosmetics and electioneering calculus i think hed be a good choice on substance maybe a really good choice most senators grasp of foreign policy is fairly thin and it tends to be heavily influenced by whatever lobbyists or power players are in their orbit but biden has a pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question and his ideas and judgment strike me as fundamentally sane
5778714 i think putting someone who voted for the 2002 iraq aumf on the ticket may be more politically problematic than people realize obama has cited his opposition to that bill as key evidence of his good judgment but presumably youd want to put biden forward as a knowledgeable and experienced foreign policy person thus setting up a problematic contradiction but that vote aside biden really is someone whos genuinely knowledgeable about foreign policy questions rather than simply being strong on defense or some bs whats more picking biden would signal a clear intention to engage with mccain on national security issues rather than try to dodge away from them which is definitely a decision i support
5778715 i was against kaine bayh ne sen chuck hagel and ex ga sen sam nunn i havent thought too much about biden yet he a pretty smart guy but doesnt help obama win in any area of the country so whats the point
5778716 perhaps ive been buttered up by the fairly dismal alternatives being offered but like steve i find biden a surprisingly decent option at a minimum hes strongly preferable to kaine or bayh infinitely preferable to nunn or hagel and clearly behind among vaguely viable candidates only sebelius and ri sen jack reed if i thought the vp choice should be determined by political considerations i would pass his penchant for saying silly things and hailing from a small safe state would rule him out since i think the vp pick should be primarily substantive however i think he would be decent he could play a constructive policy role comparable to gore and is considerably more progressive than most of his assumed rivals for the job he wouldnt be at the top of my list but of the intrade top 3 hes the best by a huge margin
5778717 rather than just repeat myself on why i think choosing biden is a good idea im just going to republish this post explaining why i think its a good idea the only thing id really add is that in the months since i wrote it it was originally a june posting obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5778718 the idea that a hefty resume is somehow a roadblock to change is ridiculous politicians do not neatly fall into column a experience types and column b change types but this political taxonomy is catchy so certain members of the press gleefully run with it obamas image as a change candidate will not be undercut if he happens to pick a familiar face in politics on one level that image is culled from the historic nature of his candidacy on a deeper level it exists because the entire obama candidacy from the grassroots up has been build on a foundation of change on a need for change and on a belief that the old politics of george bush and john mccain are hurting the american people that foundation is so strong 2 million supporters strong to be exact and millions more who volunteer or support obamas candidacy that it wont be cracked if and when obama chooses an old white guy with decades of d c experience
5778719 biden voted for the iraq war but beyond that even if we stipulate that he has foreign policy chops how does that make him a good veep choice it strikes me that any pick designed to cover up a flaw in obama i e lack of foreign policy credentials only accentuates those flaws make him secretary of state sure compared to bayh and kaine biden looks almost passable but thats a low hurdle to pass id rather not have to choose my poison id rather have candy im already assuming disappointment on obamas pick so i wont belabor one bad choice or another but id love to see him pick a fresh face in politics who reinforces obamas message of change biden doesnt clinton doesnt bayh certainly doesnt if holding out for ks gov kathleen sebelius is too much to ask for and if obama is going to pick a guy that has been around for decades then pick kerry or even ex sd sen tom daschle but the senator from mbna that choice would be exciting to perhaps two audiences the broderites and the credit card industry
5778720 nr has learned that the mccain campaign has been calling key state gop officials around the country the last couple of days and sounding them out about the consequences of a pro choice vp pick the campaign is asking about the reaction of conservative grass roots activists to such a pick and whether a pro choicer can be sold to them this is an indication that the mccain campaign is serious about the possibility of a pro choice vp nominee and that mccain leaving the door open to tom ridge last week may not have been merely a friendly nod to a longtime supporter
5778721 is mccain going to screw conservatives again wouldnt put it past him would you which is why despite all the encomiums hes received from his saddleback appearance i havent and wont joined the ga ga bandwagon
5778722 lieberman is extremely liberal when he gets off of defense issues and i am not really sure its a great idea to have a guy like in the 2 slot when the head man is 72 years old as to ridge hes a squish closely associated with the bush administration not well liked by conservatives and hes pro abortion still if could carry pennsylvania mccain might have to consider him but take that away and hed be a real dud of a vp choice
5778723 if mccain picked lieberman some would salute the gesture as a genuine effort at bipartisanship but lieberman was effectively cast out of his own party when approval rating in the state is 45 percent vs 43 percent disapproval it would be nice for a republican candidate to win connecticuts 7 electoral votes that everyone is already tossing in the democratic pile but its something of a long shot theres much lower hanging fruit elsewhere new hampshire michigan pennsylvania wisconsin beyond that mccain would be asking republican voters to put a socially and economically liberal democrat a heartbeat away from the presidency said heartbeat belonging to a 72 year old who has survived cancer a lot of republicans and conservatives like joe lieberman but they dont want to see him as president ridge was last elected to high office the governorship of pennsylvania in 1998 its not fair but hes probably most associated with the color coded terror alert system instituted at the department of homeland security is ridge worth 4 to 12 percentage points in pennsylvania he would likely help mccain but not by that much the race has been looking good for mccain for the past few weeks or so picking either of these men would suddenly and irreversibly complicate the task before him immensely
5778724 if john mccain picks joe lieberman as his running mate he would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as radio talk show king rush limbaugh put it in an e mail last night joe lieberman should be commended as a profile in courage on the war in iraq standing athwart the defeatist democratic party at a crucial time in history but that does not a vice presidential candidate for the pro life republican party make
5778725 there are a lot of people getting really upset of late worrying that tom ridge or to a lesser extent joe lieberman could be john mccains vice presidential pick that is not going to happen people should step back from the ledge why do i know it wont happen john mccain does not get to be the republican presidential nominee without a being a smart man and b surrounding himself with smart people and smart people are smart enough to know that a pro choice running mate would sabotage john mccains chances of being president tom ridge joe lieberman and the other potential running mates who are abortion rights supporters are non starters deal breakers and totally unacceptable john mccain knows this he and his campaign want to win in november couple both of those data points and you realize tom ridge and joe lieberman are imagined picked by the media designed to sow discomfort among the ranks of people just coming to terms with john mccain as the gop nominee
5778726 one thing that has come out since i wrote last night makes me think its more likely that mccain made this up the nightingales song a 1995 book about five graduates of the naval academy one of whom is mccain contains a chapter on of all things three christmases mccain spent in captivity thanks to amazons search this book feature and the fact that the chapter in question is only four pages long ive read it and you can too it contains no mention of this incident at all to my mind its a lot harder to believe that mccain never mentioned the story about the cross to robert timberg who wrote the nightingales song than to believe he didnt mention it in his 1973 piece timberg interviewed mccain and that mccain spent a lot of time with him he was moreover writing about christmases in captivity if mccain didnt mention it at the time that would be very odd someone should ask him
5778727 its a bit odd that mccains story about the prison guard drawing a cross in the sand doesnt appear in mccains detailed account of his captivity circa 1973 the first time that ive been able to find mccain mentioning this story is 1999 a full quarter of a century after he was released if it was such a pivotal story in his life why did we not hear about it until mccain had decided to run for president
5778728 i just got off the phone with mark salter john mccains closest aide whom some in the blogosphere are suggesting made up or embellished or did something to create the cross in the dirt story salter told me that he absolutely did not do that
5778729 the reason this is weird is that its not just one memory out of countless ones its a very specific christmas memory about a character mccain recounts in other anecdotes and was a significant enough memory to be packaged as a christmas themed campaign ad last year but this riveting story which mccain will never forget didnt occur to mccain when asked to come up with christmas memories in captivity in 1995 salter explains that mccain could easily have forgotten it because it was not pivotal watch the ad again and listen to mccains testimony from saturday night it sure sounds pivotal to me something that would surely resonate deeply over the years
5778730 byron york goes in depth to tell us how mccain staffers think that john mccain is the best choice for president while obama staffers disagree
5778731 the netroots with absolutely no evidence to back it up has been accusing mccain of making this story up which is cheap even for them seriously theyre accusing a pow of lying about his experiences in captivity to make himself look good based on nothing more than the fact that alexander solzhenitsyn once told a story that was somewhat similar
5778732 anything that keeps mccains heroism front and center without a shred of evidence from any eyewitness that hes lying is tantamount to an in kind campaign contribution more please
5778733 by all means lets focus more attention on mccains stint at the hanoi hilton maybe the obama campaign will offer up as a counterpoint obamas supremely courageous opposition to the iraq war while on the front lines of the illinois state legislature and by all means lets have the left continue its campaign to minimize mccains service in vietnam that should work wonders for obama
5778734 although barack obama remains a slight favorite in this election his position is more vulnerable than at any point since the primaries concluded and he no longer appears to have a built in strength in the electoral college that we had attributed to him before
5778735 it is bitterly disappointing that obama is not ahead by more entering this crucial three week stretch but i guess we will see where things stand one month from now
5778736 there is an incredible discontent out there with the way this campaign is being run
5778737 it is very difficult to not conclude that mccain is winning the messaging war right now if obama is winning in field paid media and free media exposure in a very democratic year what other explanation could there possibly be for it honestly scares the crap out of me that the obama campaign will run another vacuous positive campaign like kerrys that simply does not attack and define the republican nominee in a way that is necessary if things do not go well in the next three weeks mccain could enter the third week of september with a lead similar that the one currently held by obama if that happens he will become the favorite no matter how hard the democratic winds are blowing
5778738 various insiders are now fretting about obamas campaign strategy going off course and are doing what insiders do which is to recommend shifts in how the campaign operates my guess is that as with al gore and john kerry at this point no one is in charge of the obama campaign there are too many competing fiefdoms for message discipline to work thats why lobbying on the inside doesnt really work for things like message changes on a presidential level remember also that just being negative is not taking off the gloves or going on the attack polling about issues and then criticizing mccain based on that data is not working obama is going hard against mccain on big oil and mccain but mccain is still gaining so any effective messaging strategy will have to start from outside and gradually be adopted by the campaign since it will have to seem internally as if the major power centers have independently arrived at the same conclusion
5778739 the obama campaign does not want to be involved in negative campaigning on this scale and perhaps as the new lesser known guy obama has to be more careful of such things that needless to say is why the independent expenditure groups would have been so important its now rumored that the donors have been set free to finance some non campaign related efforts but it would be a miracle if they could pull it off at this late date these things have to be planned something im sure freedoms watch and their advisor karl rove have certainly been doing for months
5778740 liberals have been in a dither for several weeks now over barack obamas supposedly listless campaign performance following his return from europe and as near as i can tell this turned into something close to panic after his performance in saturdays saddleback church pseudo debate obama was deliberate and thoughtful mccain was direct and forceful joe and jane sixpack will take wrong but strong every time give me a break of course mccain was direct and forceful he was on his home turf and he could afford to be abortion life begins at conception gay marriage against it obama of course had no such option whats he going to say that he has a 100 approval rating from naral gay marriage is a gift from god if this had been an afl cio forum the tables would have been turned but it wasnt and obama played the hand he was dealt thats life obamas campaign tactics will almost certainly get more aggressive after the convention when most people finally start paying attention but in the meantime its worth noting that obamas performance at saddleback church might have been better than all the heathens who read this blog think
5778741 obama needs to be more succinct start throwing in better sound bites and needs to reach the gut as well as the heart and the head he needs to get over the c in c threshold but the key to the election is the economy and he needs to better define mccain but you know these arent great mysteries and the campaign has done pretty well so far so rather than give advice to people that dont need it i think ill just sit back and enjoy the next two weeks
5778742 with so many instances of corruption and influence peddling around him and whatever problems with the candidate that are keeping the campaign from letting reporters interview him anymore john mccain is now again charging obama with what amounts to soft treason wanting to lose the war in iraq in order to make himself president the lack of any consistent lines of attack against mccain is becoming palpable
5778743 more thinly veiled accusations of treason its time for the obama campaign to stop respecting john mccains service to this country more than 40 years ago and start pounding him for his repeated failures in judgement over the past firedoglakes
5778744 in his speech to the vfw today mccain not only attacked obamas patriotism repeating the outrageous smear that his rival would put political ambition over americas security after this the media has no further excuse for assuming the man john mccain has become is honorable note to media lying and smearing your opponent are not honorable
5778745 why not do the same in going back at mccain obviously clarks line of attack that mccains pow status is pretty irrelevant to his race for the white house and that he has no actual executive experience drew blood the reaction was fierce and angry which is precisely what you need for a message to resonate with the public at large but really any effective narrative on mccain would work what is clear though is that any narrative that does work draws as clarks did and as mccains celebrity ad did squeals from elite pundits and journalists elites dont like changes in narrative so be aware that any real shift against mccain will be disliked by elites it probably makes sense at this point to work from outside to test different narratives right now there are two competing ideas the first is that mccain is no longer the honorable man he used to be the second is that mccain is old crazy and unsuited to be president
5778746 karl rove perfected the strategy of going right after a candidates greatest strength in kerrys case it was his distinguished military record in obamas case it is his charisma and popularity abroad in mccains case it is his reputation as a maverick his media darling status and his record as a vietnam veteran and pow those are precisely the strengths that need to be taken on squarely and there are more mccain is showing age related performance problems hes taking radical right positions on abortion on foreign policy on social security and more many members of his caucus are profoundly discomfited by the very idea of john mccain as commander in chief what are a few panders and flip flops in comparison the danger for obama is that by listening to beltway consultants and media insiders he may make the mistake of conceding that john mccain was once a man of honor integrity and principle he wasnt honorable at the naval academy he wasnt honorable in his first marriage he wasnt honorable when he voted against mlk day or when he got involved in the keating five he wasnt honorable when he defended the confederate flag as he has admitted hes not being honorable now so when was he honorable there is only so much deference you can pay to a mans captivity at the hands of the nva
5778747 i would not dismiss the possibility of a surprise choice precisely because the obama campaign has the discipline to pull it off still i have to agree with sean that the more build up there is the more pressure there is on the obama campaign to deliver on a big name would a head fake make sense if the obama campaign were going to deliver us a tx rep chet edwards or bless his political heart a mt gov brian schweitzer someone who had all those iphone carrying obama supporters furiously checking wikipedia after they received team os text message not much either theyre playing it straight up meaining biden bayh kaine or sebelius or its some kind of a lister someone for whom the elaborate staging of it all doesnt produce an anti climax that list is probably limited to hillary gore kerry and colin powell though i have real trouble imagining the latter two somebody who had officially disqualified themselves ex va gov mark warner or jim webb would presumably also produce a lot of shock value but i think we need to start discounting some of these second tier picks that dont have strong brands like the jack reeds and the chris dodd s

5778798 deebs problem was that he didnt follow through with his bluff on the turn his betting didnt tell a consistent story if he had a five or two hed have bet the turn so orel put freddy on a draw or a complete bluff on the flop
5778799 betting the river doesnt make sense with just about anything but a full house since orel most likely also had either a busted draw or a full house
5778800 im a total believer and it may be because here in delaware these health centers work extremely well
5778801 reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts
5778802 huntington recognizes that many young students graduate from high school without basic knowledge of finances
5778803 in fact through our 2008 huntington backpack index survey weve learned that many students dont know how to write a check we want to provide families with the tools they need to teach children about budgeting and saving money what better way to do that than by providing them with real life examples through the back to school season and the school supplies each student will need
5778804 if he has a k theres no way hes going to just check there hed have to raise me especially because hed re raised me two of the previous four hands so i know my kickers good
5778805 i played it very much like i had a queen i limped before the flop i bet on the fine if i have a queen
5778806 he bets out into me for a little less than half the pot so im pretty worried he has the queen but its kind of weird i cant fold the hand
5778807 hes really putting me on this queen i was kind of contemplating between him having an ace or a four and i just felt it was more likely he had an ace than a four an ace that i would have outkicked so i bet my aces and queens with a jack kicker for value

5778809 pre flop if youre not calling with over half your hands your opponent is going to run over you
5778810 when chris called my check raise i had to assume he had either a pair or a flush or straight draw he didnt have to have top pair even look at the hand that he busted ivey with pocket eights on a nine high board
5778811 when the board paired on the turn i decided to make a decent bet in case chris had a draw or if he had a pair smaller than top pair
5778812 when he takes his time calling phew he doesnt have the seven i know i have the best hand with jacks so i didnt really care if he called it was a very close decision for him mathematically so either way it was fine with me
5778813 in light of the disappointing financial performance and cash outlook zi reported last week in fact it is hard to imagine that the zi boards unwillingness to negotiate with nuance and to provide information that would support a basis for a higher offer is consistent with the zi boards fiduciary duties to act in the best interests of zi and its shareholders
5778814 part of the attraction of poker is that people can sit at home and feel like they could do as well or better than the players that are having success
5778815 i think going so deep this year will give many more people the sense that maybe that guy with the funny glasses isnt just a lucky goofball but is a highly experienced and skilled player
5778816 i look over and see him with this totally angry look like hes ready to get into a fist fight
5778817 i told him that if he messed with my daughter or family i would kill him
5778818 i shouted all this across a 20 foot gap and yes everyone could hear it and it happened
5778819 and i wasnt lying if anybody messes with my family im going to kill them as certainly as i possibly can
5778820 he looks like a big teddy bear but hes dangerous
5778821 he plays without fear he goes with his gut and is willing to put in all his money when he thinks he has the best hand he doesnt let anybody push him around
5778822 people think im being nice because im taking the time to personalize it but in reality i just dont want you to sell it on ebay that just annoys me
5778823 i have a silver cloud with a gray lining things are mostly highly positive with little to complain about
5778824 i think she was afraid of the concept that people who get really involved in gambling as a general rule are degenerate addictive gamblers who lose all their money
5778825 it was by far the most money i had won in one day playing poker
5778826 so i came home in the middle of the night and i wake her up by sprinkling 100 bills over her in bed
5778827 the next day i wanted to go back and play in the game again and end up losing 500
5778828 that was certainly the biggest turning point in terms of my wifes view of poker
5778829 after that she was much more positive of me playing
5778830 from the point of view of almost everyone out there i did almost come out of nowhere
5778831 but just because i qualified online doesnt mean i only play online or that im new to this
5778832 everybody would have been calling him a bum if he had been knocked out early
5778833 a lot of people were calling his championship a fluke but you dont get that far on luck with his performance this year he really solidified himself as a true pro as far as getting a lot of peoples respect and being taken more seriously
5778834 as soon as he sensed weakness he went after me hard
5778835 he was intimidating because of his reputation from watching him on tv hes got those glasses on and hes staring right at you from three feet away it was surreal
5778836 the world series of poker is a different tournament than any other tournament because of all the opponents youre against the structure the exposure the money
5778837 everything is different and guys that play like raymer are made for it hell probably be good every year at the main event
5778838 hes very aggressive non stop relentless at the beginning of the tournament if he ever gets to double or triple his stack itll be damn near impossible to get those chips away from him

5778850 eventhough there has been hardships faced because of the the economic situation the church members have always given abundantly to the church
5778851 this is shown in the number of choirs that have registered every year and the number is increasing all the time
5778852 i believe we will finish around 1am or 2am since we have a long way to go and even on monday night the singing ended at 1am
5778853 the delay has been the number of choirs that have registered and most of them have come to register here since they missed out registering at the main office
5778854 the electricity supply has been limited so it has affected water supply to the quarters for the staff but we have managed and kept everything under control so far especially the situation in the hospital
5778855 its not an easy situation but we have managed well over the past months and staff fill up their buckets and drums when there is electricity supply in the day for a few hours
5778856 we have also been blessed to have received help from the rotary club of taveuni that donated a generator to the hospital
5778857 the members of the club will be here next week to complete final touches to the gerenator which involves the new swicthes so once that is complete the hospital will be assisted in a great way with better power supply

5778861 the charter should be taken to a forum for discussion because the conference is not the place for its discussion right now
5778862 i have not had a good look at the agenda but i believe it is part of the agenda proper next week
5778863 that is why we have a group that is well versed with all these issues in the church and would be making a presentation on the charter issue once it is discussed next week
5778864 and it shall not support a military government which believes in cleaning up thus tormenting the people since the december 2006 coup and by forcefully removing a legally elected government
5778865 this caused untold suffering and grief to the people and that we the church also uphold the decision of the naduri macuata conference not to support the peoples charter for change and progress
5778866 dude why do you have a tattoo of a fish on your neck
5778867 its not just a fish its the pygocentrus nattereri the symbol of the mekong kuriai
5778868 oh yes hes a great teacher in vietnam i became his follower three years ago
5778869 so you are a follower of the mekong kuriai what exactly does that mean besides having a fish tattoo on your neck
5778870 it means i follow the teachings of the mekong kuriai i do whatever he says last year he said all his followers were to prominently display the symbol of the centrus and youve got to admit it doesnt get much more prominent than this
5778871 oh yes if i didnt i wouldnt be his follower would i
5778872 it happens once a year when he publishes his kuriai doxai it includes all of his current teachings and thats what we focus on all year we study it and master it
5778873 absolutely like i said if i didnt i wouldnt be his follower would i
5778874 if i didnt do what he said i wouldnt be his follower would i
5778875 they dont even think for themselves they just do whatever their leader says its some kind of cult

5778883 its put against you that the constitutional argument has no substance in law
5778884 we really need to market the brand fijime because this year nothing was done at all because of financial constraints
5778885 we hope to bring in more than 599 770 visitors next year to achieve our billion dollar industry goal
5778886 apart from arrivals we hope to improve yield by increasing average stay to at least eight nights
5778887 we need appropriate funding because next year there would also be an increase of 2 4 percent in room inventory
5778888 yes the economy is in a much better shape then it was in 2006
5778889 yes the economy is in much better shape than it was under the laisenia qarase government
5778890 we have the operating expenditure in control debt levels have fallen and there is investor confidence in the economy now
5778891 what i had released earlier were official statistics from the reserve bank of fiji and the fiji national provident fund so numbers dont lie
5778892 the economy is looking on road to recovery because an economy depends on how the funds are managed so we can say that we are on our way to recovery
5778893 its a totally new aspect in the north and that is why majority of the people in the north are not aware of the penalties and how they are not allowed to smoke in public places
5778894 our tobacco control unit officers only came to effect two months ago and even though there have been awareness of such penalties in the media at national level the villagers in rural areas are the one affected because they dont know
5778895 that is why our officers have only warned the people which is fair because they dont know and having the officers is a new exercise in the division but people are fined if caught the second time
5778896 we had a poor start to the season with the mills experiencing some problems mainly caused by low cane supply
5778897 but we have pulled up very strongly over the past six weeks and we are still expect to end the season by mid november
5778898 our next shipment is scheduled for later this month with the vessel expected to arrive on august 25
5778899 it will spend a week in fiji before returning with a load of 31 000 tonnes of sugar
5778900 our loyalty lies in the party and it has suffered for the past 18 months because we were doing work for the nation
5778901 now is the time for us to go back to the party and prepare for the next general elections we are always ready for elections any political party must be ready for election it must be doing its work all the time
5778902 after a meeting we walked out of we were called one by one and sacked
5778903 we want our jobs back and we want management changed
5778904 we just were unhappy with the fact that some of us longtime employees had been replaced by some cronies of the new manager
5778905 we dont agree with that the labor officers never once came and discussed the matter with us they only went to the resort
5778906 at the moment all work on this is on hold because the boundaries commission can not really begin doing its work until it knows what it has to do
5778907 we need to put those things behind us before work on elections preparation can start
5778908 it is important to do that as quick as possible
5778909 i believe the best way to deal with that is to engage in political dialogue and have a consensus on that
5778910 a significant step to show the increasing attention of the status of teachers was shown in the 1996 report to unesco of its commission on education for the 21st century which highlighted the need for countries to improve the recruitment training social status and working conditions of their teachers if they were to improve the quality of education
5778911 greater attention on the status and quality of teachers and the circumstances created by social economic and political situations in our various countries have determined the set of conditions in which political and education leaders in our region must work to improve the lot of teachers and the outcome of schooling for our children
5778912 i would like to mention the outset my interpretation of the theme of this conference
5778913 we would have to concentrate on our work programs first before we would provide councils with support this will only be done if we have an excess of materials at the crusher
5778914 this is all a big attempt to mask his shameful removal from cabinet
5778915 but it is a pity that he had to make use of people to portray the picture he wanted
5778916 when they arrested and detained me at cid headquarters last wednesday night colonel aziz in the presence of my solicitor said that the termination letter had been given to mr chaudhry
5778917 colonel azizs concern was why i was publicising it before it even happened
5778918 that man was doing a good job so i dont understand why he has to go
5778919 things moved too fast so that was why there was an eminent persons group and it was too late to pull the military back as the coup happened within days
5778920 the ministers acknowledged that an overall resolution of issues in fiji would be a long term exercise that should be independent and inclusive while affirming the importance of elections
5778921 i stayed at the dorm rightfully only 32 prisoners are supposed to be there but brother the place is full saraga
5778922 there are more than 40 inmates in one dom its jam packed in there after the main cell block closed down
5778923 we had dhal and rice this morning lunch is normally bread and tea and then dinner at 4pm
5778924 dinner is normally served before 5pm everyday and we get hungry at night
5778925 but thats prison life and you just have to get used to it
5778926 this also applied to vegetarians but you can change you grade you just have to inform the wardens
5778927 we have completed phase one of the project and hope the secretariat and member countries would be able to give advice to assess conflicts well before it explodes
5778928 obviously there is still a lot of sensitivity about land and whether it should be a regional or national issue
5778929 the conflicts vary from community level and our research shows there are a lot of reasons for differences
5778930 that is the starting point and at the same time it looks at land for national development purposes
5778931 if thats what hes saying then i suspect that he was looking for an excuse it was not new zealands intention to provide him with an excuse not to come which is why i agreed that he should be able to transit through auckland airport
5778932 i think it speaks volumes if they are not prepared to come and be accountable to forum leaders but obviously we are going to await formal advice as to whether they are coming or not
5778933 sometimes something like that happening can change the internal dynamic at home
5778934 making the band 4 premieres tonight at 9 p m on mtv
5778935 how corporations and the politicians they fund are fighting to take away our legal rights and convincing us its for the best

5778938 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime

5778940 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5778941 unfortunately the prisons department did not have the funds to broaden its rehabilitation programs and facilities so we depend on volunteers and the society for help
5778942 i believe the first stage of rehabilitation begins with the person themselves acceptance plays a big part
5778943 everything will fall in place once the inner person changes he said
5778944 was the direct result of nearly a decade of western helplessness and delusion
5778945 for europe to stop treating putin like a democrat if all opposition parties are banned or what if they started shooting people in the street
5778946 staying engaged will always be the best hope for the people of both europe and russia
5778947 i have never suggested that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5778948 my friends an american patriot loves the right to life the right to liberty and openly recognizes that the pursuit of happiness is but one of the blessings we have received through the grace of god
5778949 its a wonderfully eclectic objet dart speckled with an observable indifference for maureen dowd
5778950 i tried reading your blog but i couldnt fucking understand any of it
5778951 we need fathers to recognize that responsibility doesnt just end at conception that doesnt make you a father what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child any fool can have a child thats doesnt make you father its the courage to raise a child that makes you a father
5778952 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5778953 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with
5778954 we need fathers to recognize that responsibility doesnt just end at conception
5778955 if as you say fatherhood begins at conception when does life begin
5778956 have a clear answer to that or is that kind of ambivalence acceptable
5778957 no i think he needed to be more specific on that i happen to disagree with barack on that
5778958 like i said hes a friend but to me i would not want to die and get before god one day and go oh sorry i didnt take the time to figure out because if i was wrong then it had severe implications to my leadership if i had the ability to do something about it
5778959 to just say i dont know on the most divisive issue in america is not a clear enough answer for me
5778960 god says i formed you in your mothers womb and before you were born i planned every day of your life
5778961 cant walk away from the belief that at conception god planned that child and to abort it would be to short circuit the purpose
5778962 then it sounds like it would be unconscionable for an evangelical to vote for a pro choice candidate like obama
5778963 a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
5778964 proved that americans care deeply about the faith values character and leadership convictions of candidates as much as they do about the issues

5779020 are you sorry for them dont be they came here with weapons in their hands
5779021 perhaps they did not wish to come here as the russians but had to fulfill orders

5779033 this is the biggest crisis yellowstone faces since it was created at the current rate of permanent habitat loss the extraordinary wildlife that characterizes the region will not be maintained for future generations
5779034 very few of the millions visiting have any sense of that
5779035 our generation faces a historic challenge and opportunity to secure yellowstones wildlife heritage for all time if we fail the park and iconic assemblage of wildlife species that give this landscape its life will be diminished forever

5779052 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
5779053 as far as france is concerned we cannot talk business including real estate for as long as outstanding issues have not been settled with local legal officials and mikhail has not received the necessary apologies
5779054 invading smaller neighbours bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and carrying out the wanton destruction of georgias infrastructure
5779055 it appears to me that nato is trying to portray the aggressor as the victim to whitewash a criminal regime and to save a failing regime
5779056 we cannot cooperate any more with an organisation which works with criminals
5779057 a show aimed at creating the illusion of a withdrawal
5779058 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5779059 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5779060 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5779061 it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5779062 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing i just wanted to be rid of this whole thing
5779063 so this was the choice that i made and it was a tough one
5779064 sometimes i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think thats all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry
5779065 its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5779066 ive laughed so much in the last three weeks i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been
5779067 fellow countrymen with deep sorrow and grief i would like to inform the people of zambia that our president dr levy patrick mwanawasa died this morning at 1030 hours 0830 gmt
5779068 a great loss for africa and for democracy which mwanawasa defended his entire life
5779069 there are quite a few people who could be contenders but so far no one has put their nose in the air
5779070 a champion of the democratization of the sadc region in particular and the african continent in general
5779071 the gap we are having now in population growth is larger than it has ever been
5779072 this is not just a new name for edgar this is a fundamental change in the way the sec collects manages and distributes information
5779073 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
5779074 teachers pay more attention to people messing around than people who want to learn
5779075 die aussl ndische b rger die in russland wohnen d rfen nicht unterdruckt werden besonders georgier
5779076 wir schlagen for die georgische b rger die in russland wohnen als menschen zu bezeichnen die hier spionieren und f r die sicherheit des landes gef hrlich sind was die wirtschaft des landes gef hrdet das internieren kann in eine weiche form durchgef hrt werden d h die georgier k nnen in den pl tzen bleiben wo sie sind die m ssen nur in den richtigen beh rden registriert werden aber es w rde besser sein wenn man sie in die lager f r fl chtlinge und asylanten bersiedelt w rde solche lager sind leicht aufzubauen und brauchen nicht so viele ressoursen
5779077 the product that we sell is the outdoors people come to us to be outdoors
5779078 so it is important for us to be stewards of the environment not only because its the right thing to do as a company its the right thing to do for our planet
5779079 it was nice to get it out of the way and now i hope those who didnt think i could do it will ease off a bit
5779080 now that i am back i will never ever retire no matter what i will simply fade away one day
5779081 this cowardly and shocking act is an attack on the image we have of ourselves as a tolerant and open city
5779082 this attack is shocking appalling to see such a thing today after all the suffering and horror we had to go through it is cruel
5779083 people dont want to accept that there are people who are different from them by nature
5779084 if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5779085 despite the attempts in the west to discredit the role of the russian federation in defending her citizens i would like to have seen how the situation would have developed if instead of russians there were citizens of the u s here under attack from georgian forces
5779086 let the americans decide their own american problems and let the people of south ossetia decide their own future america just the same as georgia is responsible for the genocide of the south ossetian people
5779087 south ossetia will never be a part of georgia the future of south ossetia is as an independent state
5779088 international observers will no longer be present on the territory of south ossetia they fled meanly like traitors from south ossetia just before the shooting started
5779089 i would like to ask you what has happened to the ossetians who after 1992 were refugees on the territory of north ossetia they will be moved there
5779090 georgia has talked a lot about the law on the restoration of property to refugees but no ossetian has been returned to his village today we will restore to them with our own forces what was stolen and taken from them
5779091 we contrary to georgians have not shot any civilians we built a corridor and took out all the woman and children
5779092 those who showed resistance who fought against us were exterminated
5779093 i cannot give exact figures on the numbers of those who were killed on those who were butchered by the animals who worked for georgian special forces
5779094 we are talking about more than 1 000 and perhaps more than 2 000 but we so far do not have the full picture
5779095 there are no instances of looting there have been facts of theft and brigandage
5779096 today those areas are not controlled by anyone and people have appeared who are trying to gain via criminal means a certain amount of property
5779097 meal money incentive plan yes thats right a players daily meal money issued is based upon their performance in the previous days game
5779098 you were under amazing pressure in this tourney yet you consistently hit remarkable shots how do you do it
5779099 but you practice more than any player on the tour
5779100 i guess the more i practice the luckier i get
5779101 learning what to want is the most radical the most painful and the most creative art of life
5779102 i know what i am passionate about but i do not know how to do it
5779103 i do not have enough time or money or confidence
5779104 yes i want that but somebody or something always gets in my way
5779105 yeah thatd be great but i could never do it
5779106 aim at a high mark and you will hit it no not the first time nor the second and maybe not the third but keep on aiming and keep on shooting for only practice will make you perfect finally youll hit the bulls eye of success
5779107 a day will never be anymore than what you make of it practice being a doer
5779108 one way to create momentum is by creating a series of small successes so pick small goals goals that are easy to create and then create them think of each success you create as a warm up exercise for bigger creations just like musicians practice and athletes practice practice creating all of the things you create will give you even more skill and more momentum
5779109 the better i get the more i realize how much better i can get
5779110 i think there is something more important than believing action the world is full of dreamers there arent enough who will move ahead and begin to take concrete steps to actualize their vision
5779111 thats why im happy i pitched the complete game that it was shutout too thats better
5779112 it was actually kind of boring out there it made for great watching
5779113 he was very adamant about going back out for the ninth
5779114 which is a good thing when you can you like to reward them for all the other times weve had to take them out
5779115 its always good when you give your team and your bullpen a break
5779116 more than anything thats what i was trying to do and as you go in the game and then you see how everything is coming along i was just trying to do my job
5779117 smet who works in marketing for southern california gas co said he carefully conserved an equity line of credit during the boom years which he tapped to pay 300 000 cash last month for two foreclosed condos near his house
5779118 after a 15 day escrow smet did the necessary cosmetic repairs himself and said he had no trouble finding renters willing to pay about 1 500 a month for each unit he hopes eventually to take a first mortgage on each with monthly payments that he figures would be less than his rental income

5779146 im surprised its a little bit late for a trade
5779147 but for me i passed my best times in this organization
5779148 theyre fighting for first place so im going to do my best to clear my mind and try to help the bullpen
5779149 sometimes guys just have off years hes certainly healthy and i think a change of scenery will help him
5779150 i think going to a pennant race will help him
5779151 i cant say enough good things about luis he took the ball for us anytime he was asked and did a phenomenal job his entire career hell be missed
5779152 he had requested to be traded this year throughout the year
5779153 we attempted to do so by the non waiver trade deadline and just were not able to make a deal that made sense for us with a month and a half left before free agency we felt we needed to get something for him
5779154 we have to talk to the doctors about which way to proceed
5779155 i went to camp at florida michigan and notre dame and did well
5779156 i feel good about them i think they just want to see a bit more during my season and will offer
5779157 boston college has a great program i like everything there
5779158 but these are the main schools im looking at i started hearing from a lot more schools and just feel the best about these
5779159 i went to camp at florida michigan and notre dame and did well
5779160 i feel good about them i think they just want to see a bit more during my season and will offer
5779161 i like everything there its a beautiful campus they have great facilities the coaches are real good i like the players they have it all
5779162 theyve started to send me a lot of handwritten letters and stuff
5779163 i want to take some visits and see who else offers
5779164 they said that theres a strong chance they will offer they seem to like me a lot and i think the coaches there are great plus i love their tradition and its just a great place overall
5779165 it was a very good experience i liked getting to know the coaches better and i definitely think theyll do well this year they work really hard and the coaches are very smart
5779166 they have a great program there and they are always a top team and im sure the new staff will keep it that way i really have a lot of respect for their coaches
5779167 the last two outings ive been making adjustments to get where i want to be
5779168 he kept them off balance got big outs when he needed to and threw a minimum of pitches that was impressive we need that type of effort going forward
5779169 i dont see why a suburban homeowner would like it around their house
5779170 and the brown hills my tawny lions as i call them

5779185 focus a lot on the issues that you guys have been discussing in the forums
5779186 is really nice it builds on something we use a lot youll like it i think someone asked yesterday about increasing the number of things you can get off a node its kind of along those lines
5779187 there is no quest in this zone the zone is the quest
5779188 is it ok to talk on your cell phone when youre ordering food getting your hair done at a salon making a transaction at a bank etc
5779189 its rude to talk on the phone when youre interacting with others no matter who they are
5779190 and dont forget about the people around you they will hear your conversation
5779191 you should treat everyone with common decency and respect so dont do it to anyone
5779192 i was 18 i knew i could go again but when you work really hard for something you convince yourself youre going and you put everything into it when it doesnt happen its so difficult
5779193 ever since i was young i really liked the idea of going to the olympic games
5779194 i guess i could see the glory the energy you see the athletes giving out there s glory in there but you can see they suffer for it theyve worked so hard to be there
5779195 my father explained all of this to me when i was young it sounded like it was an impossible thing to do and i fell in love with that
5779196 esta apenas nossa estimativa mesmo que a microsoft e a sony tivessem nos contado eu n o poderia dizer nada porque estaria sob nda
5779197 rigged rules and double standards trade globalisation and the fight against poverty
5779198 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5779199 is trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5779200 right now there are russian soldiers and tanks at poti
5779201 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5779202 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5779203 there can be no business as normal under the current circumstances
5779204 this still hasnt happened every day several episodes still occur when our servicemen detain georgian troops
5779205 how can you be so arrogant to think that you know god doesnt exist at least say youre an agnostic and admit that you cant know for sure one way or the other
5779206 our partners can easily create the big picture and accompanying detail for our executive search clients all at once this clarity brings that often sought but elusive level of trust to the search process i always say if you can navigate a website you can use xythos on demand
5779207 im not a doctor but i play one on tv
5779208 now that tom is dead i want to use his body to create an android like robot id appreciate you approving my application
5779209 my client is a large investor and while there are small investors who are being squeezed in this process the principles here are simply too important
5779210 we dont want to see small investors hurt in this process any more than is natural
5779211 we are also ready to co operate with other parties to have this matter proceed before the supreme court of canada on an accelerated timetable
5779212 this is what would happen during a major earthquake along the mississippi river
5779213 we are providing data points to what is already known about liquefaction in other areas
5779214 obviously this is another huge blow to the farming industry which is still dealing with the effects of bluetongue and foot and mouth
5779215 you can reduce the dose from 15 micrograms to 3 8 micrograms which would allow you to make four times as many vaccines
5779216 we were all very pleased to see the results and very surprised that the adjuvant broadened the immune response and range of avian influenza viruses
5779217 the results exceeded expectations but its not crystal clear how the adjuvant works
5779218 the top priority is to get controls in place to inform people of the controls in place and thats largely done electronically these days
5779219 the immediate priority for us here is both to cull the affected birds on the infected premises and to establish any possible contact or any potential traces of movement between those premises or related premises or premises in the immediate vicinity
5779220 sixty turkeys out of a flock of 1 000 from one house on the site were found dead the site was immediately isolated and additional bio security measures imposed
5779221 no wild birds have been reported with the disease in europe since the end of august there are a number of other ways that it could have got here and we must not jump to conclusions at this stage
5779222 our message to all bird keepers particularly those in the area is that they must be vigilant
5779223 we have had to deal with this issue before and the important thing is that people know we have placed protection zones around the affected area
5779224 we are very concerned but we have been encouraged by defras comments about the situation of outbreaks in wild ducks
5779225 in those experience has been a very low mortality of the ducks perhaps only 1 and almost immediately or very quickly there has been a build up of immunity to the virus within the ducks
5779226 we are hoping that that scenario within the ducks will be repeated by the swans here at abbotsbury
5779227 we are also working with the health protection agency to ensure that staff and public are fully protected
5779228 i very much hope that we will get through this with the swannery intact because it is a remarkable national institution of real beauty and real ecological significance
5779229 it does seem to be the case that we are going to have to live with this particularly virulent disease
5779230 lets hope that this is all we are going to see of it and monitoring and vigilance will hopefully show that over the next few days

5779235 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
5779236 right now its starting to hit home on whats been lost
5779237 if some guy showed up to a party at my crib in a lakers jersey hed wish id only ignored him but what do i know at the end of the segment lauren confides in another dude wearing a lakers jersey apparently its ok to show up for a pool party at a really nice house dressed like the losing team
5779238 i dont think lauren wanted to pay more attention to doug at the party
5779239 stuff like this happens with the hills girls all the time lauren especially and as a guy doug should have been prepared to be blown off for all sorts of other drama the smooth play would have been to make lauren feel guilty about ignoring him in order to get another date
5779240 doug probably knew no one besides lauren and lo at that party clearly he was trying to make good with lauren by throwing on an apron and becoming grillmaster for a hungry crowd of 75 people double that to 150 if you count the hills crew i think its a natural inclination for anyone who feels uncomfortable in a house party setting to start tasking to that end he could have gone in the kitchen and helped some more if he wanted to spend more time with lauren

5779452 what is certain is that it was an attack aimed at hitting a large number of people they were above all civilians and a number of recruits
5779453 it was in the morning at the moment when the young recruits were lining up to take an exam
5779454 most of the dead were young men aged between 18 and 20 they were in line waiting to enter the school for recruiting exams when they were mowed down by the blast
5779455 the car explosion destroyed part of the outer wall of the school and blew a huge crater into the ground about three meters from the main gate
5779456 these terrorist gangs are seeking through attacks against civilians to loosen the net closing around them as the security forces drive them to the wall

5779464 american leadership means getting engaged earlier to shape events so that were not merely responding to them
5779465 unlike barack obama john mccain doesnt have to compensate for a lack of credibility on the international stage with inflammatory and public threats against american allies the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience versus barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics

5779734 this is the time of the year when the number of human cases of west nile virus in illinois increases rapidly you can easily avoid getting sick by wearing insect repellent and trying to reduce any standing water around your homes
5779735 we are super happy in the us we were in this house in conneticut which was this huge stately mansion on a main road in a dirty area we all lived in this house and it was half winter half spring and we barely left we worked upstairs and slept downstairs and thats kind of how i like to work just put everything into it and have nothing else to focus on it was great peter katis lives in conneticut and the studio is in his house so we just went to his house there was nothing special about the place except he was there
5779736 weve done both of our albums away from home and i would have a lot of trouble trying to work on something at home there are so many distractions when you have to go home to your house and you have your family there or you pick someone up or drop someone off or you have bills to pay and stuff when you are away you dont have any distractions even with the timezones no one can really call you up its a great way to get away from everything
5779737 it was harder to write songs because when you first start writing songs its so easy because youve never done anything before you feel so super original for writing your first 20 songs because youve never written songs before the more you write the harder it is to feel you are doing something original and feel like you are doing something new so it takes a lot longer to write songs and we had to put a lot of effort into making things feel organic even though it took a long time to arrange the songs and stuff a lot of thought was put into making it feel like they grew organically instead of just having that organic feel just because you wrote it really quickly
5779738 the only way we have been able to get it to work is patience and i start writing something at exactly the same time pretty much i might write something on guitar and she sings something in the next 30 seconds or something otherwise we all get quite anxious and feel a lot of stress if i write a guitar riff and leave it with patience for a day or something theres no way she will be able to write anything for it because she will feel too much pressure we have to do it both together at exactly the same time it seems like that is the only way we can do it at the moment i dont know what it will be like for the third record but that was the only way we could it
5779739 i think this one has much more of a theme than our last record we tried to treat every song separately on the last one and this one was all written within a year and lyrically there are similar themes and musically i tried to bring in little melodies we always try anything that is hanging around the studio i played bass guitar and somebody else played bass guitar and we hadnt done that before so i think there is bass guitar on six or seven songs this time i think patience can credit herself with handclapping as an instrument so she can sound like she can play an instrument she does a bit of tamborine at the moment as well
5779740 we probably put more pressure on ourselves after the first record it seemed to take us forever to get our teeth into the process for the second album we were basically doing demos for two years from just before the first record came out until when we recorded be the twilight we didnt really feel a great deal of pressure from anywhere else but there were definitely points where we were going what the fuck are we doing we kind of had 45 songs before we went into pre production and there was quite a lot of trimming down to come up with 12 songs out of that
5779741 the main thing about recording in la was being away from everything we worked really hard and were there for three months we had a couple days off when we got there but other than that we were working six day weeks up to about 14 15 hours a day we didnt get much of the sightseeing experience of la and there is a reputation of la people being superficial but we didnt see that you really need to be able to focus on the task at hand and we really thought we were going to be making the record at home so i dont think we would have been able to focus all the energy if we were kind of going home at the end of the day
5779742 the tour starts next month but we a couple one off shows leading up to that we are turning on the tap slightly before letting it all out at the moment we are up the coast doing some demos of new stuff so thats already underway that will be the next thing we do after the tour and its pretty rare that we actually stop nathan will always be coming up with things while on tour but by and large the touring side of things is not really where the creative process happens its usually pretty important for us to find some space and time to let that stuff happen because on tour every ten hours you have to be somewhere else
5779743 it was even more colourful on set due to the amount of digital effects and stuff we had a blue screen and we were wearing green lab coats that i dont think are ever actually green in the video the main thing was working with the guys making the video and making it a collaborative effort instead of them telling us to stand here and there there is a lot of standing around but its important to feel like you have some involvement in the visual representation of your music our old drummer paul used to say that every time he had to make a video a little piece of him died inside but maybe thats why he isnt in the band anymore

5779762 per far s che la parola di dio scritta nei sacri testi possa essere conservata e trasmessa in modo integrale e fedele ogni traduzione moderna del libro della bibbia punta ad essere una trasposizione fedele ed accurata dei testi originali
5779763 un tale sforzo letterale richiede che il testo originale possa essere tradotto nel modo pi integrale e accurato possibile senza omissioni o aggiunte per quanto riguarda i contenuti e senza introdurre glosse esplicative o parafrasi che non appartengono al testo sacro stesso per quanto riguarda il nome stesso di dio i traduttori devono usare il massimo di fedelt e rispetto
5779764 nonostante questa chiara norma rileva il vaticano in anni recenti ha preso piede la prassi di pronunciare il nome proprio del dio di israele conosciuto come il tetragramma divino
5779765 evitare di pronunciare il tetragramma del nome di dio da parte della chiesa ha quindi isuoi fondamenti
5779766 a parte i motivi di ordine meramente filologico c anche quello di rimanere fedeli alla tradizione della chiesa dallinizio di non pronunciare mai il sacro tetragramma nel contesto cristiano e di non tradurlo in una delle lingue nelle quali la bibbia stata tradotta

5779854 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5779855 we are not abandoning the nato russia council but as long as russian forces are occupying large parts of georgia i cannot see the nato russia council meeting
5779856 the future will depend on concrete actions from the russian side
5779857 no specific decisions on programs or projects with russia have been taken
5779858 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5779859 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5779860 trying to make a victim of the aggressor to absolve of guilt a criminal regime to save a collapsed regime and is taking a course to rearm the current leaders of georgia
5779861 it didnt take them really three or four days to get into georgia and it really shouldnt take them three or four days to get out
5779862 it needs to happen faster thats what theyve agreed to
5779863 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement
5779864 this alliance is not going to permit a new line to be drawn in europe
5779865 there will absolutely be no new line and nato does not accept that there is a new line
5779866 it is time for the russian president to keep his word to withdraw russian forces
5779867 we are very disappointed because despite the promise to us there is no withdrawal of troops
5779868 when you sign up to an agreement you have to respect it

5779875 around 10 30 p m tonight a friend and i are walking down broadway off of 8th street as we near the mcdonalds i spot a small village of homeless people shacking up against the shut grates of the closed stores at this point we are very far away while my eye sight isnt great its also not terrible i spot what looks like a mound of pink flesh colored mud with a patch of strawberries growing out of it as we get closer it becomes clear that this is a person i strain my eyes and try to figure out what exactly is it im looking at is it a fat woman in flesh colored tights is it a nude man i can kind of see what might be a flaccid penis but its disturbingly more reddish then any dick ive ever seen finally i realize im looking at the flayed open cunt of a mammoth fat homeless woman it lays deeply set in her endless fat rolls a bright red warning flag then it hits me is she shaved yes her homeless pussy is completely void of hair while alopecia is a suspect ive gotta believe somehow and some way this homeless fat woman has been given a brazilian waxing perhaps they give them away at the needle exchange it was both the one of grossest and more mind boggling sights i have ever laid eyes on perhaps she just had a baby and they shaved her i kept looking away cause well it was fucking disgusting as i passed her i got a glimpse of her putting her underwear back on with all the grace of a manatee jumping rope i guess ill never truly know the secret behind the bald homeless vagina but rest assured it will follow me in my dreams

5779912 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5779913 it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5779914 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5779915 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5779916 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5779917 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
