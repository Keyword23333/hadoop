4560027 it is to walthamstow what the eiffel tower is to paris its absolutely unique the heart of the community
4560028 i always remember my time working at walthamstow dogs it was my first ever job and i was so happy to be getting a wage for the first time
4560029 it has been very popular in the last month or so but thats because of the closure
4560030 but we lost half a million pounds 900 000 last year the directors decided they just couldnt keep it going
4560031 its been a tough time for businesses theyve not had a great time of it
4560032 theres no question of the sport coming under threat it wont die out
4560033 the substantial extent of the work and the complexity around revenue recognition and vsoe vendor specific objective evidence regarding delivery of product in particular will probably cause us some further delay
4560034 we think this uncertain market is not going to have the patience for another delay
4560035 not surprising as we have heard the same comments from most of our other companies
4560036 we expect the significant business and accounting uncertainties to present meaningful headwinds for the stock
4560037 the lack of sec filings now for over two and a half years
4560038 we would like that to be the case there is nothing technologically keeping us from making it so
4560039 legal duty to act unlike a moral duty to act
4560040 urges us to raise our gaze toward heaven not a heaven of abstract ideas nor an imaginary heaven created in art but the true reality of heaven which is god himself god is heaven
4560041 our goal he is the dwelling place from which we came and toward which we are called
4560042 we are all children of god the father brothers and sisters of jesus children of our mother mary
4560043 and all of us want happiness and that happiness is found in god
4560044 helps us encourages us so that every moment of our existence would be a step in this journey toward god
4560045 gazing at mary assumed into heaven we understand better that our everyday lives although marked by problems and difficulties flow like a river toward the divine ocean toward the fullness of joy and peace
4560046 the sad spectacle of so much false joy and at the same time so much agonizing pain
4560047 this firm conviction of the church found its coronation in the dogmatic definition of the assumption pronounced by my venerable predecessor pius xii in the year 1950
4560048 from paradise the blessed mother continues always especially in difficult hours of trial to watch over her children whom jesus himself entrusted to her before dying on the cross
4560049 mary assumed into heaven indicates to us the ultimate aim of our earthly pilgrimage
4560050 she reminds us that our whole being spirit soul and body is destined for the fullness of life that one who lives and dies in love for god and for ones neighbor will be transfigured into the image of the glorious body of the risen lord that the lord casts down the mighty and raises up the humble
4560051 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born
4560052 questions about the historical jesus of nazareth considerations after writing a book on jesus
4560053 try to demonstrate how jesus himself understood his passion and death
4560054 jesus of nazareth from the baptism in the jordan to the transfiguration
4560055 there seemed to be a policy assumption in the department of education that every new school at second level should be multi denominational we dont accept that should be the case
4560056 committed to denominational education and intended to remain a provider as long as parents choose catholic schools
4560057 relegate them to the past and seems to consign their role in school ownership to history
4560058 i feel that it is important to place on the record unambiguously what heretofore could be assumed but now needs to be expressly stated namely that the catholic church makes no apology for its ongoing presence in education delivery
4560059 the matters fall into the wider space of the planning for future school provision
4560060 they will be considered along with the views of other patron interests and the wider education partners as future policy in this area evolves
4560061 this would have involved all relevant stakeholders from the bishops to the department to teachers parents and politicians and would have allowed all issues to be fleshed out
4560062 a national forum would allow public debate and would make any other arguments as seen yesterday with the bishops comments unnecessary it should be established immediately
4560063 clearly however there is a demand from parents for multi denominational education
4560064 estamos capoteando un mal temporal est la cosa muy complicada ciertamente pero estamos trabajando

4560069 i am not impugning the integrity of individuals i am just saying that in a society which is so interwoven and has such a small number of people in high office you have just got to ask for help from outside
4560070 this is illustrated by a briefing i have had from the nspcc counsellor working alongside us
4560071 he has received a text message from a victim which he has shown to me to say it is a joke
4560072 my clients and others know far more than has been given to the police already
4560073 i could not work out and am still unable to work out what really did prompt the change of heart and the revision of the advice
4560074 naturally as i was attorney general at the time i would not sit judicially in any case which may be brought in the future involving the maguires
4560075 i do not agree that there is any actual or perceived conflict of interest which prevents me from performing the functions i have which i intend to perform to the best of my ability and with the integrity which the office requires i am absolutely determined that cases of child abuse will be prosecuted where it is right to do so
4560076 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4560077 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4560078 to use that much more water than most residents is unacceptable i have no interest in being the top water user in austin texas
4560079 i never thought of myself as a curvy girl but after trying on
4560080 if i win this i will probably rethink and play in the netherlands next week and try to qualify he said
4560081 its farfetched to think that ill get a wild card
4560082 the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it does not matter but more important is enjoying my golf again dougherty said
4560083 its never fun to miss the cut especially not at home
4560084 its fortunate that we dont play here all year around said the swede who made the top 20 in all four majors this year
4560085 they chose in 2005 to go a direction and the packers chose me rodgers said
4560086 theres really no ill will between myself and the 49ers weve moved forward theyve moved forward and theyre trying to figure out what they want to do on offense and thankfully the packers have put their trust in me as far as quarterback goes
4560087 i wouldnt trade with him because i love the situation that im in rodgers said
4560088 ive just got to worry about myself and the reps im going to get going in there and making the most of them
4560089 any given play it seems like there are so many possibilities that is unique to this system smith said
4560090 the ball can come out so fast on one play and on another play its a different look its a seven step drop then you go down the field so just getting used to that and being ready for anything
4560091 weve talked about it a number of times two or three times mccarthy said
4560092 but like i told him just the fact that he was in the conversation for the no 1 pick in the draft i think it speaks volumes now why it happened and why the 49ers went in another direction thats a different story but he was one of three guys who were going to be chosen for that pick
4560093 aaron and i have always gotten along well when weve been around each other especially through the draft stuff and all of that going on he was always good to me so ive always respected him for that and i respect him as a player
4560094 the ea five years ago is not the same ea they are now we wouldnt have partnered with them five years ago

4560102 my concern is baldwin park is a city thats eventually going to fight this referendum
4560103 it doesnt make sense to me to have them count ballots when eventually they wont want this to go through the county is independent and impartial
4560104 they are trying to delay it to kill it claim there are not enough signatures when were fairly confident that there are
4560105 that well probably have to go to court to make them do the right thing
4560106 we would be bankrupt in five years if we approved that referendum
4560107 our goal of doing this isnt to bankrupt the city
4560108 we just want to guarantee we have the proper amount of officers on the streets and can compete with other agencies

4560112 as at today we have an oil reserve base of 33 6 billion barrels
4560113 obstructions and incidents that militated against realisation of full potential of the country in terms of crude oil production
4560114 maintained at an average of two million barrels per day
4560115 it was very disturbing a few weeks ago when for the first time nigerias daily oil production dropped to below 1 8 million barrels per day
4560116 it is a very big game i think it is a massive game
4560117 and i think it is a game when youre at home and youre a football player and you see the game on the tv and think i wish i could be involved in a game like that

4560123 you shall spend in the cause of god do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction you shall be charitable god loves the charitable
4560124 o you who believe do not consume each others properties illicitly only mutually acceptable transactions are permitted you shall not kill yourselves god is merciful towards you
4560125 anyone who commits these transgressions maliciously and deliberately we will condemn him to hell this is easy for god to do
4560126 whoever kills a person unjustly it is as though he has killed all mankind and whoever saves a life it is as though he had saved all mankind
4560127 do not be people without minds of your own saying that if others treat you well you will treat them well and that if they do wrong you will do wrong to them instead accustom yourselves to do good if people do good and not to do wrong even if they do evil
4560128 against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power including steeds of war to strike terror into the hearts of the enemies of allah and your enemies
4560129 o you people of quraish what do you think of the treatment that i am about to accord to you
4560130 o noble brother and son of noble brother we expect nothing but goodness from you
4560131 i speak to you in the same words as yusuf the prophet joseph spoke unto his brothers he said
4560132 to those against whom war is made permission is given to fight because they are wronged and verily allah is most powerful for their aid they are those who have been expelled from their homes in defiance of right for no cause except that they say our lord is allah did allah not check one set of people by means of another there would surely have been pulled down monasteries churches synagogues and mosques in which the name of allah is commemorated in abundant measure allah will certainly aid those who aid his cause for truly allah is full of strength and might
4560133 and fight them on until there is no more terrorism or oppression and there prevails a way for justice and faith in allah
4560134 i invite you to accept islam if you accept islam you will find safety if you accept islam allah will give you a double reward however if you turn away upon you will be the sin of your subjects
4560135 thou wilt find the most vehement of mankind in hostility to those who are muslims to be the jews and the idolators and thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe those who say lo we are christians this is because there are among them priests and monks i e persons entirely devoted to the service of god as are the muslims and because they are not proud
4560136 if we cant even pronounce beijing correctly and consistently how can we ever hope to address deeper cross cultural misunderstandings and conflicts
4560137 television networks should be setting a higher standard of pronunciation and fulfilling their role of informing and educating the viewing public
4560138 we needed that that was a wake up call when you give a team the light of day and dont follow what youre supposed to do defensively it can hurt you
4560139 its about time for chinas women to achieve some results
4560140 i just ran the first 50 metres then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4560141 i have repeatedly won gold medals in the world championships but that was nothing for me
4560142 i told her i won and she said fat girl you did this wasnt just my dream it was hers so we were just so excited
4560143 there have been many times where i have lost to tong but i worked my best at this competition she was stronger than me
4560144 whatever people say to me i will keep playing my own game
4560145 i felt that if i could win this match then i could go back to japan alive so i feel relieved that i won it

4560149 im for clean energy i just dont ever vote for it
4560150 i trust my directors i believe in the way they work and i let things happen i just try to act in the best way i can
4560151 it is a complicated film you cannot express the film or my character in a few words i play a strange and complex personality
4560152 the film is very costly because of its location the shooting equipment and the international artistes involved kerala is a small place and so it is only once in a blue moon that we can churn out such high budget films
4560153 i dont have a theatre background stage and cinema are two different things i have not done any research or done something extra to play my part i have read the play and i have just enacted it
4560154 the film is called nair san and it is based on a true story of a keralite boy who is settled in japan and is a freedom fighter the director is japanese and his name is albert the shooting of the film has begun the film is partly chinese as we are shooting there as well
4560155 it is how you acclimatise and the language the rest of the things the cameras lights and the way people work are the same your acclimatization and the language are the main things
4560156 i have a couple of offers and that too some irresistible ones but at the moment i have a lot of commitments in the malayalam film industry
4560157 i like to take up only one film at a time i dont like to do other things in between besides bollywood films require a lot of dates and sometimes my dates dont match also i feel one should be very comfortable with the character
4560158 it is an entirely different league a different art it is not an easy thing i will wait it has to happen otherwise i have no plans right now because i will have to stop my acting and then switch over to direction
4560159 georgia gori evacuated as fears of russian advance into georgia grow
4560160 georgia was one of many weapons sites the ussr had for working on chemical and biological weapons pbs had a great nova special covering the deceit of the ussr concerning their cbw facilities while the us agreed to stop playing with the super germs they didnt
4560161 were the good guys we have only altruistic reasons for producing poisons in mass quantities
4560162 the us still works with biological weapons under the auspices of working with level 4 diseases youll notice that a great number of high level containment facilities are military and those that arent are funded by the military at universities or hospitals used to getting dod funding
4560163 georgia started this mess its none of your business the georgian president is a slimy crook there are many ethnic russians in georgia who wanted no part of separating from russia
4560164 yeah and it was none of our business when that guy got shot in sarajevo few years back yet somehow we and the rest of the world got drawn in
4560165 its typical for democrats to have affairs and lie about it they are experts at twisting the truth to fit them as needed
4560166 this is how men have been since the beginning of time all any guy needs to get laid is money power or good looks look at anyone in congress who has all three of these and theres a good chance that he has had he is having or hes going to have an affair
4560167 its a dirty little secret that women are pretty much the same but are just better poker players due to their cultural training power is a force to contend with
4560168 granted there are some things that offend the sensibilities more than others but according to the bible sin is sin so who are we to keep pointing fingers and making distinctions were all hypocrites to greater and lesser degrees depending on our own value systems
4560169 be not too hasty to trust or to admire the teachers of morality they discourse like angels but they live like men
4560170 speaking as a muslim the two young ladies shouldve inquired about mcdonalds policy before that applied for the job that way they wouldve known that going in my second thought is this if they can get sued because of hot coffee then these girls might have a chance
4560171 i would prefer if all employees wear head scarves or hair nets their choice so that they dont get hair in the food muslims are notoriously clean people for whom cleanliness is actually part of their religion i think this is just blatant prejudice on a particular restaurants part
4560172 its against the law to not hire someone because of their religion its not against the law to refuse to hire someone who wont fulfill the job requirements and or dress code regardless of the reason why
4560173 you realize this was in dearborn michigan right the largest religious group in dearborn is easily muslims a woman wearing hijab in dearborn is pretty unremarkable i would think that if mcdonalds is able to accommodate hijab in other countries then it is not as much a safety issue as it is the managers refusal to make a cultural accommodation
4560174 why do you think these women filed lawsuits because this is the american way any lawyer will take crap and try to turn it into gold
4560175 the american way the american way is tolerance we do not bow to the ways of others we accept them and allow them to practice them even if we do not follow them ourselves
4560176 it was the salisbury steak and mashed potatoes that killed him
4560177 i stand accused of loving the isaac hayes movement such a voice such a talent i remember seeing him in the early days of his career singing before a sell out crowd in a pair of flesh colored nearly see through tights and a gold chain the women went wild

4560179 stealing our re bike talk how bad good is the new 2 wheel onslaught in your
4560180 the big change is the recognition that journalists are internet users they are increasingly comfortable researching and working online across many types of remixable media hyperlinks text photos videos etc
4560181 the social media release is the most technologically advanced tool in the public relations field today
4560182 our students are becoming better prepared for the career field due to their complex understanding of the value of the social media release
4560183 the social media release allows public relations to finally be caught up in the interactive world of today not only is osu teaching the most advanced technology but understanding and implementing the tool puts me one step ahead in the career field
4560184 its not a theme park its not a movie studio people dont want to see it turned into disneyland
4560185 for sure mikko is going very well and ive had to push very hard
4560186 this afternoon ive been on the limit all the time and its been difficult to increase the gap it was possible on the first loop but on the second he was going well everywhere
4560187 but ok 20 seconds is a good lead for a first day on tarmac and for the moment its going well there are lots of tough new stages tomorrow so it will be interesting to see what happens
4560188 i always knew the speed was there because we set fastest stages here last year but for some reason i could not find it in the morning
4560189 now its here again and i hope i can keep it going tomorrow it feels really good in the car and im enjoying myself for tomorrow its a simple plan full attack
4560190 the feeling in the car is better now but i had the harder tires this afternoon and in the hairpins i lost a lot of time
4560191 but tomorrow well see mikkos going well so my first job is to catch him and then well see
4560192 if i win this i will probably rethink and play in the netherlands next week and try to qualify
4560193 its farfetched to think that ill get a wild card
4560194 the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it does not matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4560195 its never fun to miss the cut especially not at home
4560196 its fortunate that we dont play here all year around
4560197 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
4560198 such individual control is maximised by allowing individuals to decide as much as possible for themselves democracy in practice gives individuals no more than a right to periodically participate in a collective decision to remove the current crop of representatives
4560199 we are going to have to sacrifice through a period of expensive energy to give our children a day of healthy alternatives

4560209 in many orthodox icons however this primary image is complemented by another the depiction of the mother of god ascending to heaven accompanied by a host of angels
4560210 a prophetic image of the glorified life that awaits all those who bear christ in the inner depths of their being as she bore him within the depths of her womb
4560211 was a time of meteoric rise for the figure of mary in popular devotion art and homiletics
4560212 a kind of spillover of holy power and transcendent benevolence from the increasingly exalted figure of christ
4560213 a deep anxiety in the face of death that apparently began to be felt by christians throughout the mediterranean world just before 400
4560214 at about the same time a new emphasis on death as a fearful and violent event in which hostile demons struggle with protecting angels over the fate of each departing soul begins to show itself more and more widely in christian literature
4560215 what fear and trembling do you think the soul will experience on that day
4560216 when it gazes on the dreadful fierce cruel merciless untamable demons circled around it as dark as ethiopians the very thought of them is more oppressive than any punishment just by looking at them the soul will be cast into turmoil terrified racked with pain and made to shrink with horror and distress and will flee for refuge to the angels of god the soul will be protected by the holy angels as it makes its way forward and upward through the air but it will discover toll stations guarding and controlling the way blocking the path of the souls that are trying to ascend and each toll station deals with its own particular sin
4560217 the anxiety before demons the fear of a pitiless judgment and a journey into dark and unknown regions
4560218 for it is a universal thing i am only afraid of the enemy who makes war on everyone he can do nothing of course against the righteous and faithful but he defeats the unbelieving and sinners and those who do their own will he does in them whatever he desires
4560219 we little ones what shall we do or where shall we escape
4560220 but we shall not remain enslaved by death as once we did when we were bound by it through the legal bond of sin
4560221 the period of time for which death and bodily death held power over her was only as long as was necessary for her to move at natural speed through unknown regions and to come to know them firsthand regions where she had never set foot before and that she was now crossing as in a journey through foreign uncharted territory
4560222 a darker pre christian apprehension of death as simple and inexorable deprivation of all that gives human existence color and joy
4560223 the only clear and viable medium in late christian antiquity for proclaiming the prospect of a gracious transformation of all humanity by god that would reach through and beyond the terrors of death was the story the feast and the theological interpretation of marys death a death witnessed by the apostles and the church and celebrated with prayer and pious ritual in which jesus himself received the departing soul in his arms and the body though buried itself soon came to share in jesus own bliss and glory
4560224 for the lord had transferred him by a peculiar judgment which only that person knows who understands gods hidden decrees
4560225 the prospect of a gracious transformation of all humanity by god that would reach through and beyond the terrors of death

4560236 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring

4560263 after consulting with investigators it became clear to me that they are pursuing certain technical lines of investigation which could be severely compromised if too much information is divulged to the public at this stage
4560264 very shortly we will be able to provide more information as it pertains to arrests but now for the benefit of the investigation it is more prudent if the information is kept until those lines of the investigation are fully exhausted
4560265 it is incorrect to say that according to licence condition the government would not allocate spectrum beyond 6 2 mhz as operators grew the government had to come out with guidelines and policies to make spectrum available to operators
4560266 the only possible way the spectrum can be priced beyond 6 2 mhz which would be sustainable and acceptable to the industry would be to price the spectrum at the unit price as rs 1 650 crore fee for pan india mobile licence divided by 6 2 along with prime lending rate to take care of time value of money

4560297 well just by the fact i was elected would go a long way in fixing it
4560298 the approach hes taken is one that is political he expects there to be no change in the outcome this is only to draw attention to himself and his re election efforts it begs the question whether the congressman is as concerned about the 15 and 16 year old girls at western hills high school as he is about his election i think its a question voters should be asking

4560336 while sitting at the airport in the capital of malawi awaiting another flight to the south i had the distinct impression that the place i found myself was much different than israel west bank of course it was a different continent and a different culture but there was something else that is almost unexplainable and yet i assume something palpable for those who have experienced it sitting in the airport in malawi i was completely at ease which caused to me realize how completely uneasy and tense it was to live in the west bank im not sure why i didnt notice it when i got back to canada but within 10 minutes of landing in africa my body recalled the tension of living in the occupied territory this is the same kind of tension that i believe the directors of the place where i worked spoke of quite often its also the same kind of tension the girl i went with experienced during her second visit this past february its a terrible thing to live your entire life in that kind of tension

4560342 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4560343 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4560344 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
4560345 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
4560346 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park

4560394 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system
4560395 my calculations are good news for the future of the device
4560396 i modeled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions
4560397 i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes
4560398 clems result was not obvious since there are competing mechanisms for ac loss in the bifilar configuration it turns out that for typical parameters when the spacing between adjacent tapes is small enough the result is very simple ac losses decrease as the tape width increases and the spacing decreases
4560399 this result is helping to guide us and our partner siemens in an optimized design for a fault current limiter in a major doe sponsored program and it is expected to open a path to a commercial product in the future
4560400 i cant vote this time but i want to see as many people participate in the process as possible
4560401 i think obama has generated a lot of interest in the presidential election but its also really important for people to vote in the state and local elections those probably have a more direct impact on our lives
4560402 we have to make ourselves heard and we have to express our interest and opinions on issues like darfur and the sudan
4560403 getting those people who dont vote regardless of age or party affiliation to register and to vote
4560404 this is a positive way to get kids involved a way of getting them to participate in the political process and hopefully a way of getting other young people to register
4560405 this is an election that has excited a lot of young people
4560406 no doubt there are young mccain supporters out there but among the people i know there is a sense that obama is inspiring young people much in the same way john kennedy inspired a young generation

4560410 we do not imply that a legislature could never require that scientific critiques of prevailing scientific theories be taught
4560411 under an ethical duty to present accurate information to their students and are relied upon to maintain accepted scientific standards
4560412 design theory poses a unique threat to the education system in that it relies almost exclusively on attacks on a secular school subject in order to advance particular religious views
4560413 he was the most kind soft spoken man very polite
4560414 he made his bed put his clothes on a hanger he was a career military man spit and polish to the end
4560415 it does concern me that not only in missouri but apparently other states this is the person they turn to
4560416 it does illustrate how difficult it is to find doctors willing to do this
4560417 i assure them ive taken care of everything so that nothing will go wrong i help them calmly go through the procedure
4560418 it will have the same effect the guy will die

4560433 a friendly reminder from pillsbury to keep your head back when making our delicious buttery biscuits
4560434 you take the red pill you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the rabbit hole goes

4560436 i told you we never should have hired woody allen to run our ad campaign
4560437 youre right youre right well terminate his contract immediately but then who will run the campaign
4560438 f r mich ist es sehr ironisch da das buch selbst ein opfer von extremismus wird

4560441 but there are things that bring good colors here in alaska
4560442 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
4560443 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
4560444 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
4560445 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
4560446 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
4560447 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
4560448 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
4560449 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
4560450 near the coast is the last place youll find color
4560451 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state
4560452 the lakes tend to pop toward the last moment mid to late october
4560453 that makes it look like evening in the middle of the day
4560454 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4560455 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4560456 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4560457 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4560458 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4560459 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4560460 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4560465 un an apr s lapparition des premiers sympt mes de la crise financi re mondiale tous les indicateurs confirment que la fi vre a touch lensemble des conomies les conomies europ ennes ont subi une r cession rapide surtout les plus importantes comme lallemagne la france litalie et naturellement lespagne et toutes affichent une croissance n gative ou proche de z ro par rapport au trimestre pr c dent leurope doit r soudre de fa on coordonn e les probl mes communs comme ceux li s la stabilit financi re ici la banque centrale europ enne joue un r le important jusqu pr sent elle sest surtout attach e combattre linflation plut t que de sefforcer de relancer l conomie et sa capacit cr er de lemploi
4560466 min s par les nombreuses mauvaises nouvelles conomique de lann e derni re il est vident que les consommateurs sont pessimistes pourtant il ny a pas de raison de paniquer il y a galement des arguments en faveur dune perspective plus positive ainsi le prix du p trole a baiss de pr s dun quart en un mois et le prix de plusieurs mati res est galement nettement moins lev de ce fait le risque dune inflation encore plus galopante diminue et ce m me si leuro est pass en dessous de la barre des 1 50 dollars ce qui fera du bien aux exportations europ ennes l conomie allemande a certes recul de 0 5 pour cent mais ce recul a t nettement moins important que pr vu en bref cela ne ressemble en rien la r cession dont on parle avec un recul annonc pour les deux prochains trimestres dici l il est recommand de ne pas nous parler sans cesse de r cession
4560467 techniquement nous nen sommes pas encore l mais psychologiquement leurope sest engag dans la r cession eurostat indique une baisse de 0 2 pour cent du produit int rieur brut dans la zone euro le pire r sultat jamais enregistr depuis la monnaie commune la commission europ enne essaie dapaiser les tons alarmants et douvrir le parachute mais ce qui inqui te vraiment bruxelles cest la confiance des entreprises et des consommateurs qui a chut et a atteint un minimum historique et r duit n ant tous les espoirs dune r action la preuve vient paradoxalement dun indice positif malgr toutes les hausses de prix des mati res premi res linflation reste stable quatre pour cent cela signifie que les citoyens ont r pondu la hausse des prix par une abstinence de la consommation et ont ainsi provoqu la tendance n gative

4560482 if whats happening in my pants is any indication the movement to shrink torts is dead in the water
4560483 you and me were meant to be together and i know this because the spirit of a bunch of dead babies told me so
4560484 i object to just how beautiful you are on the grounds that its just not fair to all the other women in the world
4560485 you know as an officer of the court im allowed to carry handcuffs so tell me have you been a naughty little whore
4560486 so what do you think up for a little brown sugar vs johnnys board of education

4560488 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4560489 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4560490 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4560491 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4560492 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4560493 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4560494 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4560495 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4560496 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4560497 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4560498 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4560499 cuando empezamos con spore pens bamos en c mo hacer un motor que tuviera la posibilidad de expandirse as que s lo a adiremos a la experiencia
4560500 creo sin embargo que tenemos una muy buena oportunidad de llevar spore en diferentes direcciones los editores son tan atractivos y divertidos que queremos avanzar en eso as como en la jugabilidad que hemos puesto al juego nuclear
4560501 being one of millions with a close connection to cancer i know i need to do my part
4560502 i dont know if anyone else notices or cares but i love this playlist
4560503 i found your site from a friend and i fell in love with the dress as soon as i saw it and knew that that was the dress for me i did complete my transaction sucessfully and i absolutely love the dress i have not used it yet as my wedding isnt until net year i will definately be using your site again
4560504 i read an entry on craigs list in which someone referenced your site i felt like id hit the jackpot i tell other brides who are looking to buy or sell wedding merchandise to go to your site its a treasure trove and such a unique idea thanks for offering it the dress was exactly as pictured and was new as advertised
4560505 you better cut those trees down to get the view you want
4560506 where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases my blues away
4560507 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
4560508 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
4560509 right now danger ratings are about low to moderate for the province
4560510 but it only takes a few days of warm weather for those danger ratings to change and that means an increased risk for fire starts
4560511 it took the government to be back up against the wall from questions that were asked by the chinese press
4560512 the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4560513 to the average person these places just seem like extreme wilderness where youll find lions and tigers and bears
4560514 the reality is that youre never more than a mile from a road
4560515 the supreme good is like water which nourishes all things without trying to it is content with the low places that people disdain thus it is like the tao in dwelling live close to the ground in thinking keep to the simple in conflict be fair and generous in governing dont try to control in work do what you enjoy in family life be completely present when you are content to be simply yourself and dont compare or compete everybody will respect you
4560516 by thich nhat hanh much of what the tao te ching says came back to me

4560521 e quando le nostre labbra si incontrarono fui certo che avrei potuto vivere centanni
4560522 mio padre dice che quando ti sembra che la vita sia dura
4560523 le persone pi tristi sono quelle che non credono in niente passione e soddisfazione vanno di pari passo perch non c nulla che possa farla durare nel tempo
4560524 e imparai con umilt e fatica ma imparai quello che dovevo fare
4560525 se segui qualcosa che ti scombussola ti conviene andare sino in fondo
4560526 prima che ci incontrassimo vagavo per la vita senza una direzione
4560527 thats ok we see your willingness and we know your heart its not necessary to continue youve shown what youre made of
4560528 that was a huge performance boy did he knock it out of the park
4560529 we really needed that pommel horse routine and he hit it big time
4560530 after all we went through to get here we did amazingly well
4560531 all we said was be consistent be consistent they did a tremendous job
4560532 we kept saying this was a team of nine and we almost needed them all artemev and raj really came through
4560533 they did a great job and i have lots of respect for them
4560534 they had a lot of pressure on them and they were able to come through japan was great too it was wonderful just to be part of this competition
4560535 i think this group weve got a lot of good athletes out there that want to stay with it and do what we can do
4560536 how do you think this one ground got away from the filter did he just climb up and jump over the edge into the blackness or did he tunnel his way through the filter shawshank redemption style
4560537 how would a coffee ground tunnel i mean what could such a tiny thing use to dig its way through
4560538 is there really a difference i mean this could be my life and what always happens in my really real world or this could have just happened in my head would that make the impact on me and others that may read it any less potent
4560539 propaganda economic warfare preventive direct action including sabotage anti sabotage demolition and evacuation measures subversion against hostile states including assistance to underground resistance groups and support of indigenous anti communist elements in threatened countries of the free world
4560540 if the director of cia wanted to extend a present say to someone in labour leader suppose he just thought this man can use fifty thousand dollars hes working well and doing a good job he could hand it to him and never have to account to anybody there was simply no limit to the money it could spend and no limit to the people it could hire and no limit to the activities it could decide were necessary to conduct the war the secret war it was a multinational maybe it was one of the first journalists were a target labor unions a particular target that was one of the activities in which the communists spent the most money
4560541 responsible in great measure for stirring up the turmoil and raising the doubts about us that exists in many countries in the world today
4560542 what right have we to go barging around in other countries buying newspapers and handing money to opposition parties or supporting a candidate for this that or the other office
4560543 i had all sorts of dirty tricks to hurt their circulation and financing the people running ramparts were vulnerable to blackmail we had awful things in mind some of which we carried off
4560544 in the early 1950s when the cold war was really hot the idea that congress would have approved many of our projects was about as likely as the meyers role in operation mockingbird was further exposed in 1972 when he was accused of interfering with the publication of a book alfred w
4560545 the cia currently maintains a network of several hundred foreign individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the cia and at times attempt to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda these individuals provide the cia with direct access to a large number of newspapers and periodicals scores of press services and news agencies radio and television stations commercial book publishers and other foreign media outlets
4560546 can a man be of benefit to god can even a wise man benefit him what pleasures would it give the almighty if you were righteous what would he gain if your ways were blameless
4560547 but if i go to the east he is not there
4560548 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
4560549 theres an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the judiciary committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing
4560550 either eat the other one or something would blow up
4560551 these chemicals have the ability to cause severe damage to dna in the mitochondria to the point that they totally inactivate it they knock it out altogether
4560552 the mitochondria consumes the oxygen to give you energy and if you damage it as happens in a number if diseased states then the cell starts to malfunction very seriously and there is a whole array of diseases that are now being tied to damage to this dna parkinsons and quite a lot of neuro degenerative diseases but above all the whole process of ageing
4560553 many additives are relatively new and their long term impact cannot be certain this preservative clearly needs to be investigated further by the fsa
4560554 the food industry will say these compounds have been tested and they are complete safe
4560555 by the criteria of modern safety testing the safety tests were inadequate like all things safety testing moves forward and you can conduct a much more rigorous safety test than you could 50 years ago
4560556 my concern is for children who are drinking large amounts
4560557 we will no longer be able to sell anything to our students that is not approved by the state as being a healthy food or beverage
4560558 milk that may be flavored but contain no artificial sweeteners and no more than four grams of sugar per ounce nondairy milks such as soy or rice milk which may be flavored but contain no artificial sweeteners no more than four grams of sugar per ounce no more than 35 per cent of calories from fat per portion and no more than ten per cent of calories from saturated fat per portion one hundred per cent fruit juice vegetable juice or combination of such juices containing no added sugars sweeteners or artificial sweeteners beverages that contain only water and fruit or vegetable juice and have no added sugars sweeteners or artificial sweeteners and water which may be flavored but contain no added sugars sweeteners artificial sweeteners or caffeine
4560559 i certainly support the healthy lifestyle but the state is taking all autonomy away from the local school boards
4560560 we would only lose 90 000 if we turned this down but we would have the freedom to serve the students what we deem appropriate
4560561 given the wide spread interest is this issue it is important that the assembly committee on health examine whether proposition 65 should apply to artificial sweeteners since some contain chemicals like chlorine which can be extremely toxic it is critical that the committee examine whether products containing these potentially hazardous chemicals should be identified by a label so consumers can make more informed decisions before using these products
4560562 document after document from johnson amp johnsons own files show that they knew all along that their advertising was false and that it was misleading consumers into believing that splenda is natural safe and healthy we look forward to telling a california jury the full truth about splenda including the substantial efforts johnson amp johnson went to in an effort to cover up its deception
4560563 that it is in the publics interest to stop fraudulent and misleading marketing at any point
4560564 we want the secret to making things come out the way we want them to
4560565 going faster and faster is a sickness of our life
4560566 life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself
4560567 i have to get in touch with my inner self to find out
4560568 the opportunity went in the third set when i lost my serve
4560569 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can now that im down to the last two races
4560570 if it was over hed be the greatest olympian that ever lived
4560571 its a historic event and this relay could be the one for the eighth gold and you dont want to be the one to screw that up for him
4560572 if he phelps wasnt in this sport and swimming i dont think id be as good
4560573 he is up there and he makes me become better and stronger in training without him i wouldnt be standing here today
4560574 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
4560575 very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
4560576 you showed the sign where it said stun gun in use and you just change the word gun for bolt and its a meat processing plant
4560577 we want to make sure we got our game plan set
4560578 we want to make sure the entire procedure is laid out all the personnel know what they are supposed to do
4560579 we just needed to get the a guys in a good spot
4560580 we got the job done we had safe starts that was the goal safe starts no dq disqualification for no reason
4560581 weve heard those words a lot i dont think well be allowed to leave china if we get a dq
4560582 there was anxiety i was telling myself dont go past 15 metres underwater dont go past 15 metres and the other guys off the blocks dont go early off the blocks
4560583 the relay might be all it comes down to its a historic event and this relay could be the one for the eighth gold and you dont want to be the one to screw that up for him phelps
4560584 hes unreal i never thought id see that kind of swimming itll be one for the ages in 100 years everyone will remember this olympics what michael did or hopefully does
4560585 esiste o no anche una scettica come me devo dire che si sta ricredendo
4560586 is a defiant breath of fresh air who dares anyone to try and put her in a closet and opens doors everywhere she goes solely on the merit of her talent
4560587 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4560588 the verbal assurance that president medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4560589 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4560590 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4560591 it is the position of the united states that that will require international peacekeeping forces that are neutral in the conflict
4560592 would never ask georgia to sign on to something where its interests were not protected
4560593 there really did have to be important clarifications in order to make sure that georgian interests are protected
4560594 i think it would be a major accomplishment for georgia to get the russians out of their country and back effectively to the status quo

4561063 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4561064 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4561087 its the second meeting that we had the opportunity for citizens to address how they felt about the crime issues in marion its obvious that theyre planning to take some action
4561088 we may have to come together to solve some of these problems and build better relationships and operate as a community
4561089 if you can tell me the secret to that ill abide by it
4561090 when alleged abuse continues and goes unchecked it creates ill will in the city and in the department
4561091 if the crime rate does not improve and actions are not taking to rid the community of these perpetrators which everybody knows who they are except the police yes we hope to build a bigger coalition throughout the city

4561097 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art

4561103 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4561104 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty

4561137 when elderly people complain theyre tired most doctors say yeah well youre old they tell their patients that feeling listless is an expected part of aging but there are reasons people are tired and they need to be investigated for clinicians the message from our study is that a lack of energy is widespread in the elderly but its not normal
4561138 i believe anergia is the universal language by which the elderly talk about their health problems
4561139 instead of noting symptoms of pain or a depressed mood many older adults feel more comfortable telling their physicians that they are tired as health care providers we need to start learning how to further identify the underlying causes of this lack of vigor and address them
4561140 as our population ages it has become paramount to the health of our nation to accurately describe the health problems associated with age
4561141 a central feature of the frailty phenotype that we described years ago is self reported exhaustion the current study suggests that this concern expressed by patients or their caregivers is important and may be a very useful question in identifying older adults susceptible to functional decline and poor health outcomes
4561142 empire and atari are both dedicated to providing fans with better gaming experiences and this new partnership will allow empire to reach the widest consumer audience during this upcoming holiday season

4561144 empires strong product lineup is a great addition to ataris distribution portfolio allowing both companies the opportunity to extend their reach to the growing mass market gaming audience

4561149 the lincoln mkt reinforces our commitment to further expand americas fastest growing luxury brand providing an all new vehicle to the showroom thats been crafted and honed for a new kind of customer
4561150 the mkt will offer the comfort of a luxury sedan the spaciousness and flexibility of a crossover and the performance of a sports sedan courtesy of its ecoboost engine
4561151 at the same time this perfect blend of performance and power is elegantly wrapped in the refined design cues that have become synonymous with modern lincolns
4561152 ecoboost engine technology is another symbol of what luxury means today
4561153 lincolns should drive as beautifully as they look delivering as much refinement on the road as their designs do even while standing perfectly still
4561154 embracing the same spirit as the concept the lincoln mkts design represents harmony in motion balancing sculptured shapes and contours traditionally associated with beautiful cars on a crossover vehicle that offers the luxury of space and efficient powerful performance
4561155 there are more than 35 000 visits each year in the u s to emergency departments for injuries from nail guns
4561156 over the past three years we have consistently found the sequential trigger twice as safe as the more commonly used contact trip trigger
4561157 the contact trip trigger allows workers to rapidly fire the tool and more frequently results in injuries from accidental discharges double fires and ricocheting nails
4561158 we found that carpenters with more training were better equipped to handle the tool and less prone to injury carpenters were best protected when they received both classroom training and hands on instruction unfortunately most residential carpenters including immigrant workers are less likely to get training compared to the union workers we studied
4561159 there are currently no regulations that require the sequential trigger be used or that define minimal training requirements even though data suggests there should be
4561160 yes this is something that we see happen after major sporting events such as the super bowl world series and national basketball association nba playoffs that can extend into the wee hours of the night i am willing to bet that the same phenomenon will occur during the november elections these events are in real time so obviously people on the west coast have fewer problems the next day than do people who live on the east coast i wouldnt be surprised if half the viewers were more exhausted than the athletes doing the races
4561161 most people are like i can stay up later and watch the olympics for one night and they do and get into it so it becomes a pattern and after three or four nights they are exhausted the good news is that the olympics are time limited the games began on aug 8 and end on aug 24
4561162 absolutely the washington d c based national sleep foundation says that for every 1 7 hours of sleep we lose a night we have lower overall productivity and alertness the following day maybe you can make it after just one night but this becomes a big deal after two or three nights keep in mind that americans sleep an average of 6 9 hours per night so if you knock off 1 5 hours very few of us can function on 5 4 hours of sleep per night i dont want to be driving next to you on the highway if you have lost that much sleep
4561163 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
4561164 schip and medicaid provide an important safety net for americas families especially for families with chronically ill children these programs allow kids to get the care they need so they can feel better grow stronger and thrive in school
4561165 when children who need care do not receive it their conditions worsen and are harder and more expensive to treat later because of medicaid and schip millions of kids can get regular check ups take the medications they need to stay well and see a doctor when they are sick parents of any uninsured child should find out if their family is eligible for low cost or free insurance before sending their kids back to school
4561166 kids are getting these drugs from their homes or from their friends homes but there is a tremendous disconnect or denial among parents about this
4561167 overall this generation of teenagers is partying less and getting high less but what they are using and some of the reasons why they are using are very different than in the past
4561168 theyve heard about oxycontin and vicodin in the news and they think theyre ok if they dont have these drugs in the house
4561169 what they dont understand is that there are 40 or more different prescription drugs that are widely abused
4561170 there are literally millions of prescriptions sitting around on medicine shelves across america that need to be thrown away
4561171 ask your kids what they think of heath ledger dying and then really listen to what they say
4561172 conversations like that will make the difference it isnt about having the big scary drug conversation its about a lot of smaller conversations that arent so scary
4561173 national survey of american attitudes on substance abuse xiii teens and parents
4561174 patients do follow physician recommendations to exercise when instructed to and patients who follow exercise recommendations tend to have lower systolic blood pressures than those who do not
4561175 non pharmacological methods such as exercising are important in improving blood pressure control on a population level as this study looked at the cross section of the u s population
4561176 that would result in an annual reduction of and all cause mortality by 6 percent 4 percent and 3 percent respectively
4561177 it is thus appropriate to recommend exercise as most patients will follow their physician recommendations and this is associated with improved blood pressure control and likely a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with uncontrolled blood pressure
4561178 despite clinical trial evidence and national guideline recommendations for exercise counseling to be provided for patients with high blood pressure this study demonstrates that only one third of these eligible patients received exercise counseling
4561179 much more needs to be done to ensure that patients with high blood pressure receive appropriate counseling on lifestyle change including counseling on the importance of regular from their physicians
4561180 they could have died within months to a year or two
4561181 they direct traffic recognize when foreign invaders come into the body and they can induce formation of killer cells to go after the invader
4561182 the antibody decorates tumor cells so any passing t cell touching that cell briefly will adhere to it much longer than normal and then the whole program of cell killing is kicked off
4561183 i think its exciting that we have new tools to treat cancer
4561184 whenever you have specificity to act against the cancer cell and also solicit host systems to combat the cancer i think thats an advance
4561185 if i give this to a person with a normal immune system will i take out all the b cells
4561186 probably and you have to ask yourself what the significance of that is
4561187 this was unexpected we really did not expect to see the tumor promoting activity of these creams
4561188 we thought it would be prudent to test dermabase by itself to see if it had tumor promoting activity
4561189 we did not think it would but lo and behold to our surprise we got an increased rate of skin cancer
4561190 the answer is we dont know our study raises a red flag and points out the need for epidemiologists to take a look at people who use moisturizing creams and the companies that market these products should take a look at animal models and see if their products promote tumors
4561191 this study could definitely be a warning to alert these companies to consider testing moisturizing creams with some sort of assay
4561192 these creams need to be tested first before they come to market
4561193 it is by far the most common cancer we deal with skin cancers account for more than half of all cancers combined but most skin cancers are totally curable
4561194 we need to moisturize otherwise our skin gets dry and we get
4561195 we have just learned about this study and are currently reviewing it to understand the findings
4561196 eucerin original creme has been on the market for more than 100 years and is a highly respected dermatologist recommended brand it has been widely used by both individuals with normal skin and those with diseased skin under the care of physicians and no incidents of this nature have ever been reported
4561197 treatment with vanicream skin cream clearly did not increase the proportion of animals that developed tumors
4561198 the product has been around for 50 years and has no safety issues related to it
4561199 i saw that there was a void when i when to congress so i started participating to get a good handle on what strategies and what policies the united states should mount
4561200 when i was in toronto it dawned on me that we should have one of these great conferences in my district in oakland then someone reminded me you cant do that barbara theres a travel ban so i went back to congress wrote and introduced a resolution that would lift the travel ban im proud to say that in the pepfar bill that president bush signed into law that travel ban was repealed now we need to implement the regulations which were working on
4561201 that is something that was left out of pepfar and we couldnt negotiate it with the other side hopefully when there is another president we can go back to the drawing board and fix that its absolutely essential that we have coordination between hiv aids initiatives and family planning i want to repeal the global gag rule that does not allow organizations to receive federal funding to provide full reproductive health counseling including abortion counseling it is a shame and disgrace and does a disservice to women harming millions of women throughout the world
4561202 theres been a severe undercount the black aids institute knew this i knew this members of congress knew this bai is calling for a domestic pepfar and i fully agree with them they want 1 3 billion to begin i think we need billions and billions and billions more
4561203 the responsible education about life real act be for real thats my bill has more than 100 co sponsors that bill would in essence allow states to use federal funding to teach comprehensive sex education in public schools to teach young people how to prevent the transmission of hiv and aids and also how to prevent unwanted pregnancies its got to happen
4561204 hopefully with a new president well be able to push that policy forward
4561205 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted toward men with genetically similar odors
4561206 it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pills as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4561207 theres a large train of thought that one of the best ways of dealing with avian influenza is by detection and containment
4561208 the ability to detect and type the influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up controls as quickly as possible to minimize the spread of any potential pandemic virus
4561209 i have no difficulty with them wearing these jerseys around newry but in other areas at certain times it would not be safe
4561210 as a mother i would have to protect my children
4561211 we have to create space where children can wear anything they want in order to promote diversity and inclusion

4561254 as much as i loved painting spidey my new approach will be more traditional meaning pencils inks and color i still draw him in much the same way but hell get inked instead of painted
4561255 ill be doing the cover then providing pencils and inks for the interior
4561256 i dont actually have the whole script yet but ive got enough to get started the first five pages have been a lot of fun what i love best about spidey is his movement his overall look and motion should be totally unique among superheroes
4561257 its pretty tough to make him unique it gets harder every wednesday but every artist still wants that chance myself included
4561258 my approach along with many others is to take things i like from various artists and combine it into something new its not terribly original but it works well enough

4561368 htc is good at developing uis user interfaces and touchscreen interfaces and also at working with a complex operating system like windows mobile i have pretty strong faith in htcs ability to work with linux and android and roll out a device that t mobile htc google and the open handset alliance will be happy with
4561369 there have been complaints on the developer side around the sdk software developer kit it is also facing competition from other oses operating systems namely the limo foundations flavor of mobile linux the no 1 seller of smartphones has also announced its intent to offer the os royalty free and we cant forget about blackberry the iphone and windows mobile devices
4561370 android is late to the party and will have a tough time gaining significant market share in this crowded marketplace but at the end of the day google wants more openness in wireless networks with greater access to the internet from mobile devices this is happening

4561431 john mccain is far and away the most consistently anti abortion of all the top contenders
4561432 withhold government funds from health care providers and organizations that dont hire people who refuse to perform abortions or provide certain types of birth control
4561433 this definition would allow health care corporations or individuals to classify many common forms of contraception including the birth control pill emergency contraception and iuds abortions and therefore to refuse to provide contraception to women who need it
4561434 the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation

4561437 the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation

4561446 de netto mediabestedingen lopen terug en natuurlijk zullen er titels omvallen dat is zon beetje de strekking van het artikel over de licht teruglopende bestedingen in de maand juli in het financieele dagblad van donderdag 14 augustus jl wellicht enigszins kort door de bocht want wie iets langer meeloopt in de media weet dat de zaken toch wat genuanceerder zullen liggen sowieso zien we in het grafiekje in de papieren versie pw van de verschillen in maandbestedingen al dat april ook een dip kende maar dat deze trend zich niet echt doorgezet heeft ook hebben we op dit moment de olympische spelen en het zou dus heel goed kunnen dat de adverteerders gespaard hebben om juist nu een belangrijk deel van hun budget uit te geven zeker daar waar print een belangrijke functie heeft op het gebied van inhakers wel is het natuurlijk zo dat print het zeker niet makkelijk heeft de laatste jaren maar dat heeft heel andere oorzaken en niet de gemeten dip in juli dan de nielsen cijfers weliswaar sinds oudsher het instituut voor mediabestedingen maar ook bij deze cijfers is het verstandig om de realiteit in de gaten te houden allereerst registreert nielsen niet alles de non spot bestedingen worden niet gerapporteerd en ook lang niet alle websites worden meegenomen door nielsen laten dit nu juist twee vormen van adverteren zijn die het meest in de lift zitten waar het dus op neer komt is dat het ons inziens beter is om eerst nog eens even de rest van het jaar af te wachten alvorens om het hardst te roepen dat het allemaal kommer en kwel wordt in medialand op de beurs noemen ze dat stemmingmakerij oftewel be carefull what you wish for cause your wishes might come true

4561450 musharraf is going to fight these charges on a moral ground to try to disprove them but when it comes to the numbers i think hes lost it
4561451 they dont know what they are getting into they have pushed him into a corner maybe before he might have thought about stepping down but not now
4561452 i think he feels that his replacement at this stage would compromise pakistan
4561453 negotiations are going on between the coalition and the army for a safe exit to be given to musharraf
4561454 i think the americans and the army are demanding he be given safe passage for the army impeachment would mean a huge distraction from the war on terror and may even be seen as the army being impeached
4561455 weve said he can have what he wants his house his security

4561461 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case
4561462 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4561463 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4561464 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4561465 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4561466 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4561467 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4561468 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4561469 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4561470 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4561471 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4561472 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4561473 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4561474 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4561475 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4561476 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4561477 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4561478 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4561479 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4561480 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4561481 that keeping our children safe from sexual predators in the 21st century can best be achieved by ensuring that local national and international police cooperate across borders and across the digital divide worldwide
4561482 we are strong supporters of lasting peace in mindanao as a way to achieve development we do not believe that independence for mindanao is appropriate
4561483 be a good deterrent to terrorism good for security and would help spur economic development in mindanao
4561484 i was invited as a member of the diplomatic corp of the philippines
4561485 i have a very honest answer no we do not have plans to have military bases in the philippines not in mindanao not anywhere
4561486 when i look at aidens friends and i see some of them married and have a family i would imagine that would have been the way aiden was
4561487 life would have been very different for all of us
4561488 it sort of brought it all back to the surface at the same time i had got on with my life i suppose i had to you see having older children but especially for the younger children
4561489 at the time you just couldnt sit about and feel sorry for yourself
4561490 are running out of places to go and basic necessities
4561491 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4561492 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4561493 some sad incidents happened at a time when we had a boom in the tourism industry it is as if the sun had set at noon
4561494 my effort will be bring the leaders of the agitation to the table so that all the problems are resolved
4561495 regional countries are capable to do it we all need to protect the iraqi state
4561496 i have never said iran would move in to iraq when america left the country i have just said america is aggressive and it is cruel and it will have to exit from iraq soon
4561497 this issue was underlined during our talks yesterday natural gas and oil agreements take time because they need investment
4561498 turkey is one of most important routes for iran to transport the iranian gas to europe and officials from our two countries are continuing their negotiations

4561502 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4561503 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4561504 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4561505 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
4561506 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
4561507 having complete control of a high powered os would make all of the performance demanding adobe software run rings around any other implementation if engineered correctly it would become the viable desktop alternative to both the pc and the mac
4561508 im pretty concerned because being that theres a school right here next door summer time theres a lot of kids out yeah it doesnt make me feel too good that this guy is on the streets
4561509 that would undermine the purpose of the payments which was to avoid public disclosure of the affair
4561510 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous
4561511 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4561512 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4561513 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4561514 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4561515 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake

4561518 we thought the impression motivator would intensify impression response meaning that if you were conciliatory youd become more so but being aware of making a good impression made the subjects do the opposite
4561519 men who try to make a positive impression by being conciliatory risk forfeiting their own economic outcomes and women who try to make positive impressions by being assertive can risk damaging their relationships
4561520 one implication of the study is that people have a menu of options when it comes to negotiating behavior and they need to choose strategically
4561521 if you are establishing a new relationship you can take a hit financially when the economic outcome is more important and the relationship isnt needed or already established more aggressive tactics can be pulled out from time to time our recommendation is that the more negotiators of both sexes are conscious of dynamics affecting negotiation the more planning or practicing they can and should do
4561522 if you were to touch that hot stove it would hurt

4561528 one of the things that drew me to the project
4561529 but what do you use for the puke is the question on the office weve used cream of potato soup looks good from a distance but up close it looks milky
4561530 whether you do sweet puke or savory puke we came up with i think a mixture of applesauce and jell o with chunks of fruit in it it was actually kind of tasty

4561536 he did a little cameo at the bus stop reading the magazine that had vesuvius fishs original band on the cover
4561537 his line was something like well you cant always live your dream which got cut a really nice guy i got to hang out with him and interview him

4561540 the troops at the enquirer were instructed not to do any anti hillary clinton stories during the campaign
4561541 this act is the legacy of the countless children including danny keysar whose parents founded kids in danger who have been killed or injured by unsafe childrens products and toys
4561542 it is to honor their memories that we must now undertake the implementation of this landmark measure
4561543 this new product safety law is responsive to the mounting evidence and dire consequences of our broken product safety net this bill patches up our current system by giving the cpsc the resources regulatory authority and enforcement tools it needs to protect consumer from hazards posed by unsafe products
4561544 we applaud congress and the president for supporting this critical reform and urge the cpsc to implement this law effectively
4561545 this long overdue law gives the cpsc the shot in the arm that it desperately needs
4561546 it is now up to the cpsc to use the tools given to them by this law and restore the confidence of consumers in the products on store shelves
4561547 this is a huge victory for consumers over big business
4561548 this law puts safety first by making new and important changes like requiring that toys be tested for safety before they are sold and creating an internet database where consumers can share information about dangerous products
4561549 protecting americas littlest consumers better was always a good idea but now its the law
4561550 we look forward to working with a stronger cpsc with more tools at its disposal
4561551 we especially appreciate the visionary features of the new law such as its ban on toxic phthalate chemicals in childrens products and its creation of a revolutionary new publicly accessible database of potential hazards
4561552 for the first time it bans several chemicals from childrens toys at the same time it requires more research be conducted on those chemicals rather than allowing potentially dangerous exposures while research is underway i hope the message is clear chemical companies can not neglect their responsibility to do well designed safety research and then use the lack of evidence of risk as a justification to sell potentially dangerous products
4561553 we hope the enactment of this law marks the beginning of an era of more transparency and scientific integrity not only at the cpsc but all federal agencies

4561555 my nerves are really creeping in the more i think about it
4561556 after the first round i might be a little bit better

4561558 we were working out and everything was fine then the days went on and as youre sitting there just waiting for the first round it gets a little nerve racking

4561562 we were working out and everything was fine then the days went on and as youre sitting there just waiting for the first round it gets a little nerve racking
4561563 what we found was that problems typically seem to start in a mans 40s and affected only about 40 of the men in these age groups
4561564 made to throw a predetermined caloric portion of their food into the garbage
4561565 there was no evidence of the collection of data on replacement or positive behaviors

4561579 our university our students and our region are enriched by experiencing diverse cultures chancellor maccormack said
4561580 the history art music and religion of india hold important lessons for all of us as we strive to be better citizens of our own community and the world on behalf of umass dartmouth i thank the three rs foundation for its exemplary generosity
4561581 we are excited to be part of this educational initiative that will allow umass dartmouth students to learn about india at a time when the information super highway and global economy are creating important east west connections said pandit ramadheen ramsamooj director of three rs foundation
4561582 among our highest priorities is to develop innovative teaching strategies rooted in indian culture
4561583 an endowment of this size to bridge ancient civilization of india to the most modern civilization of united states through education is a most powerful statement to society said dr

4561602 dat was een gok maar als ik nog eerder was opgestaan had je me voor de finale kunnen opvegen uiteraard had ik het liefst de kwalificatie eis in mijn eerste poging gehaald en was ik meteen daarna teruggegaan naar het olympisch dorp maar dat zat er niet in het belangrijkste is echter dat ik me heb gekwalificeerd

4561623 serck controls will apply our communications in the area of water oil and gas power and utilities process control and safety systems all around the world
4561624 it is rewarding to see that kepware communication protocols will add value to a significant player in these vertical markets
4561625 the ability to connect with virtually any equipment we might encounter at a customer site is a requirement of our business in the past we have developed protocols for many rtu applications while this meets the immediate needs for our clients and the particular projects maintaining and supporting these protocol drivers does present support issues
4561626 the support costs and the ever expanding connectivity requirements of our clients had led us to look to an organization that was a leader in connectivity products our research showed that kepware is a quality partner and that they can be relied on to remain current with technology and will deliver the connectivity we need now and into the future
4561627 ioimage represents the first physical security device offered by e convergence solutions to data networking vars and the many high level government customers they serve in the washington dc area and beyond
4561628 weve begun to incorporate physical security solutions in our product offering because theres a logical association between keeping someone from coming in the door and then letting them on the network we feel that physical security and data networking security are a powerful combination for convergence applications and that video surveillance is the next big data network application
4561629 ioimage offers network based intelligent video products its a natural extension of our capabilities to add this to the network enabling clients to access surveillance from anywhere
4561630 this partnership with e convergence solutions offers a comprehensive reach into the physical security it data and government security markets
4561631 now we can provide a simple to install solution to the data networking industry an important sector within our sales and marketing efforts
4561632 our recent research shows that as the customer becomes even more powerful winning retailers view public perception of their commitment to environmental friendliness just as important as the actual cost savings and carbon emission reduction component
4561633 so while the store makes for a logical place to reduce energy consumption it also presents a viable opportunity to flaunt some greater good behavior in order to win more wallet share
4561634 retailers hold tremendous possibilities for reducing demand when the grid reaches the breaking point
4561635 but until recently these buildings have not participated in demand response programs in a meaningful way by using our technology we help chain stores participate in demand response while protecting the shopping environment as a consequence site controls is able to alleviate stress on the power system while helping our retail customers generate top line revenue

4561639 some would argue its not truly king crimson without genius drummer bill bruford who saw this prog rock unit through its earlier spellbinding incarnations but with adrian belew tony levin and guitar mastermind robert fripp still in the fold and with pat mastelotto and gavin harrison pounding drums in a double trio format this remains a creative enterprise not a half hearted repackaging from mellotron psychedelia and proto metal in the 70s to a more mathematical vibe in the 80s crimson always kept things technically challenging and cryptic as hell but strangely melodic even funny there have been long hiatuses but the ship sails armed with new music well into the 00s
4561640 was founded to offer an ethical choice for everyday living
4561641 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4561642 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4561643 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4561644 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4561645 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4561646 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4561647 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4561648 all ministers to visit the central coast and wollongong between august 11 and august 22
4561649 im always in the illawarra inspecting important road projects as i am in the rest of the state
4561650 i dont know how many ministers have been here i would hope that all our ministers are out in every electorate talking to the public i mean thats our job
4561651 if the economics stack up there is no reason why it cannot be built and operational within that time frame
4561652 whether its fully funded by the federal government or a public private partnership remains to be assessed but three companies have already shown an interest in the project
4561653 the ministers approval of the terms of reference is timely given the priority accorded to the rail project by this weeks meeting of the illawarra infrastructure priorities forum convened by jennie george and myself
4561654 were also widening the popular brighton lawn walking and cycling tracks constructing a four metre wide promenade which will run along the foreshore and feature lighting and seating
4561655 our first task however is to replace the 38 year old failed sea wall which was identified as a high priority in the coastal zone management plan
4561656 when the council endorsed its management plan and budget in june we made a commitment to long term financial sustainability by reinvesting substantial funds into the citys basic infrastructure rather than embarking on major debt funded projects
4561657 people are concerned about the transparency of the agreement between australand and shellharbour city
4561658 we want to get to the bottom of this delay and i think one of the best ways for that to happen is to have this contract released
4561659 i totally understand there will be matters that are commercial in confidence and of course they should not be made public but there will be a lot of aspects of the contract that im sure can be made available
4561660 the public want some reassurance about the project they are nervous when they hear the word delay and so am i
4561661 they have not sold the very valuable foreshore land yet
4561662 he has done a wonderful job with the council and i want to put all those issues aside
4561663 that would make me think it was not in the best interests of the project to release it
4561664 much of the document has already been released the ombudsmans office has already ruled that what we released was satisfactory that was done 10 years ago
4561665 obviously what matt and lylea said was they would get advice wed like to release as much as we could but the whole thing is you dont want to jeopardise the project
4561666 dont race down to flagstaff hill headlands are one of the regions prone to tsunami
4561667 they were going to look at a flood in the nepean west of sydney area as an example but it was after the 2004 tsunami and they were a bit light on for modelling disasters in nsw which was the state they wanted to do it in
4561668 they wanted to look at a serious scenario and they decided on a tsunami
4561669 the group was looking for a community along the coastline that was fairly well developed with industry wollongong seemed to fit the bill so the model was done there
4561670 the model is used to discuss the sort of problems that could occur in catastrophic events
4561671 people living under the 10m contour line within 500m of the coast or 1km from the coast and in a flood plain would be evacuated in the case of a major tsunami

4561675 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art
4561676 this particular piece of guerrilla art seems to have accomplished this lofty goal brilliantly
4561677 but i will tell you i think this is a smart and fun piece of public art
4561678 we have been discussing this issue with new york and other regulators since we announced last week our plan to purchase our retail clients ars and we thought we were making progress
4561679 we are still open to trying to resolve our investigation in a settled fashion
4561680 fairly clear and established because weve done them with a number of institutions
4561681 a well known lifelong liberal activist and supporter of democratic candidates and use of his song and his voice in a commercial bashing barack obama is anathema to jackson
4561682 we had nothing to do with the creation or distribution of this ad whatsoever
4561683 mr mccains name should quite simply be removed from this lawsuit immediately
4561684 acted as an agent and in concert with sen mccain and the republican national committee
4561685 it certainly looks and smells like a mccain campaign piece
4561686 as at today we have an oil reserve base of 33 6 billion barrels
4561687 obstructions and incidents that militated against realisation of full potential of the country in terms of crude oil production
4561688 maintained at an average of two million barrels per day
4561689 it was very disturbing a few weeks ago when for the first time nigerias daily oil production dropped to below 1 8 million barrels per day
4561690 they create a good atmosphere its only in the last few years weve seen things like this
4561691 some of them are wearing a bit too little maybe but i can accept it
4561692 i think were quite open now this sort of thing is normal now on tv
4561693 im only 19 so i dont know what it was like then

4561695 we just try to do cute things to make people laugh its a great feeling to be able to do that
4561696 if you feel your clothes coming loose or your bra slipping it can be a bit scary but you cant panic or at least let it show

4561703 we wish we were in a better spot than where we were but on the other hand it could be worse as well
4561704 well just keep working at it weve been doing our best every week we just have to keep doing that and hope the finishes will come
4561705 the only time that would ever happen is like jimmie johnson last year at homestead whatever his points lead was and he finished something like 16th actually seventh after he won four consecutive races before that
4561706 if something comes like that and its for the championship or youre in that 12th spot and youve got 100 point lead at richmond the chase cutoff race you might be a little bit more careful but other than that youre going to race the same all the time
4561707 you give it your all you give it your very best and just do the best you can every week and you hope the finishes will come along with it
4561708 i dont think about anything in the race car except for finishing and doing the very best we can do that day and trying to figure out how to get the very best finish we can for that particular day
4561709 you look at the points during the week or on the way home

4561716 senator obama has included a set of carefully targeted tax proposals that narrowly aim benefits to specific types of taxpayers while senator mccain provides broad tax relief with benefits that are indirect
4561717 in both cases tax relief is provided to the vast majority of the electorate
4561718 senator obama provides tax relief directly to individuals without making major changes in how the tax system interacts with or affects individual and business decision making
4561719 senator mccain provides broad tax relief and channels most of it to businesses with the notion that the best way to help workers is to encourage investment and ensure that the u s remains competitive in the global marketplace

4561724 all the hyatt hotels in hawaii are progressive and work to think outside the box when it comes to the operations and comforts of not only their customers but also their employees the challenges they and all hotels face in hawaii is maintaining their trained work force by keeping them and their families healthy and able to work in a safe environment they are able to keep their work force intact this lowers costs for training and lost days and increases productivity they have achieved this by having safety training programs family health fairs hot meals a life balance program and discounted and or free stays at other hyatt properties

4561730 im interested in stories but stories of real political complexity that when i begin working on them perplex and preoccupy me
4561731 i dont want to dramatise chaos which is what some people want to do
4561732 what appears to be incomprehensible chaotic repellent and insane acquires instead shapes of meaning becoming compellingly engrossing rather than merely repulsive and alien
4561733 there is a huge tendency in journalism these days to ask a question to which only two sides are presented which is phony and a nonsense
4561734 that is trying to extract the black and white from a story that has many many grey areas if a story is complicated it is important to keep burrowing into that complexity to enlarge your understanding of it
4561735 i tend to become most fixated on stories when they disappear from the news but are obviously not over
4561736 i responded like many others at the time thinking it was a huge story that would shape the political campaign but after a little while it just disappeared
4561737 the main reason abu ghraib quickly disappeared is because in 2004 the united states was effectively a one party state im afraid the real reason democrat presidential candidate kerry caved in on this issue is that he understood as the president did that americans werent too exercised about the abuse of prisoners in the war on terror
4561738 we are all implicated im afraid because we havent wanted to see ourselves clearly everyone across the political perspective found relief in the vilifiction of a few rogue soldiers at abu ghraib and looked the other way while far worse was happening as a matter of policy on a continuing basis
4561739 we wanted to react with outrage at what the soldiers had done but we also like to identify with the lone whistleblower and that at least partly was what soldiers like sabrina harman had done too
4561740 i dont condone what the soldiers did at abu ghraib but given the way the chain of command works and the explicit praise they were receiving from superior officers for how they were treating the prisoners where was the space for them to voice any protest against their orders if you fight terror with terror how can you tell which is which
4561741 was screwed over yes but she also screwed up badly
4561742 but the complicity the blind eye and the cover up the buck passing and the butt covering the self deception and the cowardice the indiscipline and the incompetence infected every link in the chain of command that ran from the m1 block at abu ghraib to the pentagon and the white house a military bureaucracy that had been politically cowed and corrupted from the top by civilian masters who had no experience of combat
4561743 i tend to think of writing as writing but where both fiction and non fiction have to be truthful to succeed in representing the world non fiction has the added advantage and burden of having to be factual
4561744 fiction on the other hand is the work of imagination which also has its advantages and burdens of course a good non fiction investigator requires a good imagination and a novelist doesnt imagine things without some drawing directly on observed and experienced external reality
4561745 it is possible that there has been too much injection of the author into the narrative in non fiction lately but equally possible that some of the approaches of non fiction could be introduced into fiction much of which has become very interior

4561789 it is a very nice diamond because of its size
4561790 and it has what they call a silver cape on it its about the size of a chiclet gum its rectangular in shape
4561791 but when you find out who did it let us know were always looking for ideas
4561792 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art
4561793 this particular piece of guerrilla art seems to have accomplished this lofty goal brilliantly
4561794 but i will tell you i think this is a smart and fun piece of public art
4561795 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
4561796 i dont speak about it to get paid for it i speak about it because i love it i understand theyre a family restaurant but i think it cant hurt them to have a little spice

4561801 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4561802 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4561803 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4561804 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4561805 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4561806 when you do a crime of that nature youve got to be held accountable
4561807 he is my brother still and i ultimately would like to seem him serve his sentence in canada for one reason the possibility of visitation is a little bit easier and just the conditions might be a bit better in canada
4561808 mostly we just try and talk to each other and try and help each other as much as we can when it comes to emotional support
4561809 we do talk to him but its quite a lengthy process when it comes to back and forth communication
4561810 were able to send emails to him but in order for him to communicate with us he writes a letter and it is scanned into the computer and the embassy forwards it to us that way
4561811 viral video on the internet while apple shortly thereafter modified its billing practices complexity and confusion in billing continues to be a pain point for many wireless customers and in turn the customer service division of the carriers who field the complaints
4561812 you would think the telecommunications industry would have figured out they really need to coach a new customer in terms of what their first bill is going to look like get in front of the complexity of this whether its the purchase of and understanding of the bill or the installation and talk them through it to give them a realistic preview of whats to come with their first couple of bills
4561813 i think they could probably help themselves quite a bit if they did more of that
4561814 douglas was worried that he contributed to sean and i having to kiss for twelve hours
4561815 it wasnt twelve hours but it certainly felt like it
4561816 this scene went on for a long time like half the day and its getting old and i go over to sean and i guess he didnt know that i was wearing a prosthetic
4561817 a full chain perspective from cradle to grave to assess whether and to what extent the implementation of ccs will increase environmental impacts
4561818 i think that we have to allow that to be tried i frankly think that there are very few utilities who want to do it because it will make the electricity much more expensive

4561843 the motion capture analysis gives our coaches crucial data on how to avoid injury as our athletes are training
4561844 and also how we can modify their bikes to cut crucial minutes when racing without sacrificing stamina in their runs
4561845 were all huge triathlon fans around here and were honored usat will use our 3 d technology to optimize the us athletes in beijing for superior performance
4561846 but we also believe the ret l system provides a common dynamic fit language that will ultimately be used to further the science of fitting a bicycle to the human body and therefore help manufacturers make better bikes
4561847 it is our goal to continue to take advanced technology make it easy to use and apply it to endurance sports where it can quickly and effectively increase athlete performance

4561862 where these marks are present the preaching of the word the administration of the sacraments the exercise of discipline and the practice of community the church will inevitably transform the culture around it when we are the church as christ commands us to be we change and so does the world

4561904 when database technology first came on the scene some 40 years ago no one wanted to take their mission critical applications to such a technology cobol files and paper records were the trusted and reliable approach but over time that changed
4561905 similarly daas adoption will take time becoming mainstream in about three to four years when it can support complex and mission critical applications

4561909 another easy way to understand karma is through the law of cause and effect for every cause there is an inevitable effect what you do not want done to yourself do not do to others
4561910 effects are similar to the cause if you create actions to bring suffering to others you shall harvest suffering on yourself

4561918 da je v mariji ki je v imenu celotnega stvarstva sprejela boga ki je postal lovek vnaprej nakazana ne samo pot ampak tudi cilj

4561927 what happened on the night of aug 7 is beyond comprehension the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity the georgian leadership could do this only with the perceived support and encouragement of a much more powerful force

4561960 well i guess if anybody would know whats not in the fundamental interest of newfoundland and labrador its stephen harper because he reneged on his promise and he worked against our interest by breaking a 10 billion promise
4561961 this election is not going to be decided strictly on green shift people have to stand back and say ok fine what do we get from stephen harper and the conservatives theyve cut back on funding for volunteers and minority groups and legal rights

4561990 people can find ways to reach their market without blogging or twittering but i think its a big advantage
4561991 it depends on the market but youve got to go where your customers are
4561992 i bought their argument that if you have something to say this is a good way to say it
4561993 and i felt like it was a good way to get more conversational with the market not just our customers or potential customers but everybody who has an opinion on the market
4561994 we invested the time and energy on day one creating a blog on a separate domain that would give us a platform to talk publicly about issues that we think are relevant

4561996 a couple of times a month were getting an inquiry that i dont think we would have gotten before
4561997 what other activity can i get that much discussion and penetration from out of 10 minutes of effort
4561998 the value of answering a technical question if youre a consultant and getting visibility is huge
4561999 im active on some other sites but linkedin is the only one that ive seen results from
4562000 its making the sales process more about your past work and less about how good you are on a phone call
4562001 if something catches my eye i make sure to respond
4562002 but i cant say that ive twittered something and a sale came through
4562003 its not a channel im comfortable doing a commercial relationship through yet
4562004 its much more about finding new opportunities weve never made a sale over twitter and im not expecting that wed do so
4562005 the fact that someone follows you on twitter doesnt make them a contact its not where i build relationships
4562006 after linkedin i probably drive more business out of twitter than out of anything else in terms of web 2 0

4562031 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
4562032 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
4562033 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
4562034 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
4562035 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
4562036 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
4562037 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4562038 the president was writing checks to the georgians without knowing what he had in the bank
4562039 the president got out in front of the planning when he talked publicly about using naval forces
4562040 at that point we need to look at treaty obligations our bilateral relations with the turks and others waterway restrictions and what kind of ships might be appropriate and usable something like the comfort or something already in the med mediterranean

4562042 is there more to our universe than what i can perceive through my senses
4562043 god has chosen things which are not the invisible to bring to nought things which are the visible
4562044 that would imply that the velocity of light was more than ten million times faster prior to 3 000 b c this possibility would also alter our concepts of time and the age of the universe the universe might actually be less than 10 000 years old

4562062 the thompson library is a jewel on the ohio state campus and its renovation into a beautiful thoroughly modern facility will enrich the work of students and faculty for generations to come
4562063 i am thrilled that we are able to do so thanks to a great partnership of state capital funds campus resources including athletics and the private gifts of good friends such as pat and thom robinson
4562064 athletics is an integral part of ohio state and part of our responsibility is to advance our academics
4562065 our commitment to excellence extends throughout campus and supporting the library is one way our department can help provide ohio state students including our student athletes a truly world class education

4562067 he is well aware voters here at home might see that as presumptuous
4562068 whether by the end of this week he will be seen as presumptuous or overly cocky
4562069 that means walking the fine line between looking presidential and appearing arrogant and presumptuous

4562092 it is in fact the burial cloth of jesus christ
4562093 very balanced very thoughtful and very spiritual presentation of what are critical scholarly issues
4562094 its an historical account of the cloths location and custodianship over 2000 years and its about the shroud as an object of scientific study political scrutiny and as a symbol of our christian faith
4562095 it was the start of a long debate about the authenticity of the shroud and that debate still goes on
4562096 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
4562097 to find out that something like that is just a fake
4562098 blood stains seen on the cloth contain chemicals from human blood and werent painted on the catch is that the stains are red but old blood turns black
4562099 a propitious occasion to contemplate this mysterious visage that speaks silently to mens hearts inviting them to recognise the face of god

4562101 1 cm of the new sample had to be discarded because of the presence of different color threads
4562102 if we reexamine the jericho shroud with all the latest modern technology then maybe we will find out more information that will help solve the secrets of the shroud of turin
4562103 this is another source that could shed light on the mystery of the shroud of turin
4562104 role of calcium carbonate in fiber discoloration on the shroud of turin
4562105 the role of calcium carbonate in fiber discoloration and especially its relationship to the possible means of formation of the image on the shroud of turin describes a fascinating hypothesis and experiment the hypothesis may provide the chink in the armor of the hitherto un crackable problem
4562106 i was authorized to cut approximately 8 square centimetres of cloth from the shroud this was then reduced to about 7 cm because
4562107 1 cm of the new sample had to be discarded because of the presence of different color threads

4562127 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling

4562131 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today

4562567 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4562568 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4562569 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4562570 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4562571 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4562572 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4562573 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4562574 i did modified bootcamp and it was sooooo good but i pulled my left butt muscle doing walking lunges
4562575 this is who i am and this is what i do
4562576 my real age is 16 i dont pay any attention to what everyone says
4562577 never has any media outlet called me to check the athletes ages
4562578 we are a sports department how would we have the ability to do that
4562579 we already explained this very clearly theres no need to discuss this thing again
4562580 the fig and the ioc are the proper bodies to handle this
4562581 im the only one who makes it the real way from scratch
4562582 vi har aldrig tagit s mycket som vi gjort under detta halv ret

4562584 he wrote that while an ordinary man was obliged not to participate in lies artists had greater responsibilities
4562585 that would undermine the purpose of the payments which was to avoid public disclosure of the affair
4562586 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous
4562587 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4562588 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4562589 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4562590 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4562591 hes just to be very frank with just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4562592 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4562593 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4562594 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4562595 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4562596 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4562597 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4562598 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4562599 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4562600 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4562601 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4562602 the equivalent of 1500 people working full time and transcribing 60 words per minute
4562603 i want little nothing more than this one request show me color
4562604 take a look all around this studio there on that wall
4562605 is a painting that shows the beauty of all i have to offer
4562606 i need something more you cant simply expect me to see these colors with eyes that dont see
4562607 i was born blind and have lived my life without color ive been told of these things beauty color from what i hear these are the dimensions in which you live your life to me they are nothing more than abstract concepts ive heard you do work with a paintbrush to rival nature itself so i ask you simply one thing show me color
4562608 i will try good sir i cant promise that i will succeed but i will not stand by and watch you live a life not worth living
4562609 a life not worth living how can you say that i run a business of repute im the mayor of this town
4562610 i heard you painting i heard your brush i heard it dip in to the paints then fly across the canvas what else was there to hear
4562611 did you not hear the colors the blues as they swept past the reds and the yellows mingling with the greens
4562612 i heard none of this where do you get this silly notion of hearing colors quit dawdling and playing around prove to me that color exists
4562613 okay im going to explain to you exactly what color is
4562614 the very fact that light exists proves all of this
4562615 youre telling me that this magical beam that i cant sea floats through the atmosphere and turns in to all these beautiful things you see
4562616 yes sir the very fact light exists means colors have to and the fact you feel the warmth of the sun upon your cheek means you have to know light exists
4562617 something has to exist which is heating my cheek but i dont see how beauty elegance and color has to be a result of it i cant see light youre trying to prove color to me with something else that i cant see this is rather infuriating i would prefer if you could just show me
4562618 i cant show you unless you can see the only way to know color exists is to open your eyes
4562619 the beauty of your presence fills me with a splendid joy
4562620 from thy heart pure virgin living water will flow that those who thirst will drink christ

4562626 the applicant should not be extradited to the united states before midnight on 29 august
4562627 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4562628 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4562629 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4562630 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4562631 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4562632 ive been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had
4562633 we have been a loyal transcore customer since 1994 and rely on their sophisticated technology to keep our operation running smoothly
4562634 with an already popular web area and also a newly created fetish area the gay area will for the first time in venus history also appeal to the gay members of the public as well as professionals
4562635 apart from the booths of exhibitors it also contains a stage area for live shows signings and other model appearances
4562636 historically there has always been a lack of a dedicated gay area at venus even though the gay public has a great affinity to its adult industry with porn stars often achieving real stardom and current films and porn topics being much more integrated in everyday lives than in the general publics
4562637 gay consumers are also traditionally willing and able to spend more money on adult entertainment than straight ones so it only makes sense that a dedicated gay area pays tribute to this
4562638 the guys at otb video have been working diligently on getting this done for all of the fans who have over the years requested a way to enjoy the show without having to search all over the huge fair with its hundreds of straight exhibitors
4562639 for the first time this year there will also be a strong advertising campaign aimed specifically at the gay public to make sure the companies exhibiting in the gay area get the audience they deserve
4562640 by coming up with a sophisticated sponsoring concept and by closely working with construction companies and the venus organizing company we have managed to create a concept that makes an area dedicated to gay companies and products possible and also affordable at the venue where the whole adult industry comes together in europe every year
4562641 also the gay public was never specifically invited to venus before
4562642 only very few booth spaces and sponsorship slots are left so act fast if youd like to join us in berlin its a perfect opportunity for u s labels that would like to present themselves to the huge european marketplace selling in europe is especially attractive for american companies these days as prices there are traditionally high and with todays euro to dollar exchange rates the money made in europe is worth so much more for u s producers
4562643 weve always found that gay consumers shop owners and other business representatives are much more comfortable if they have a dedicated section for the gay industry
4562644 the venus fair is a very hardcore place and not having to see all the straight material on show is a big plus for most gay visitors
4562645 we all do these shows for the business aspect and future possibilities we can create by getting new relationships and of course strengthening old ones the gay section will surely be a huge success for all who are able to get booths
4562646 i totally have the textbook crushes on gym guy facebook guy and barracuda guy

4562648 lifestyles filled with hd high definition media and digital audio demand quick and universal data transfer usb 3 0 is an answer to the future bandwidth need of the pc platform amd believes strongly in open industry standards and therefore is supporting a common xhci specification
4562649 as with the previous versions of usb it does have industry wide support throughout the pc ecosystem
4562650 these devices are increasingly offering more storage and so they need a faster way to get data on and off the device there will likely be devices that use usb that will not need all the bandwidth that superspeed provides including mice keyboards and printers however over time as superspeed usb becomes less expensive more devices will add it
4562651 superspeed usb with its increased bandwidth is certainly a threat to newer versions of firewire including firewire s800 s1600 and s3200 which deliver 800 mbps megabits per second 1 6 gbps and 3 2 gbps respectively
4562652 mr gambari looks forward to returning to myanmar and continuing his consultations with the government and other relevant parties
4562653 permitted him to go to public school rather than attend school at casa pacifica where he would be safe
4562654 in fact everything we have indicates they did everything right in this case its an unfortunate circumstance but the school didnt fail to do anything
4562655 the outward appearance of cross dressing wearing makeup wearing girls clothing shoes etc
4562656 im waiting for the iphone 4g this one will be obsolete in a week
4562657 our offense made a huge jump last year and if they continue in that direction i think the skys the limit for our team
4562658 if you watched the new england playoff game david garrard played right with brady
4562659 our defense just didnt play as well as their defense did we didnt get any turnovers we didnt make the stops we needed i definitely feel were getting closer
4562660 its nice of coach to say that but i didnt play as well as i should have
4562661 when we got in the red zone against the patriots i slipped up i made too many mistakes and we got field goals when we needed touchdowns
4562662 knowing that caa creative artists agency represented the jets pick and their own pick the jaguars should have been more proactive and tried to do a deal before the jets signed gholston
4562663 for the second straight year the jets have done bad deals in the first round so there was precedent for jacksonville to be aggressive with harvey they should have worked off what new england did at no 10 and did their own deal with harvey one that the player might have been willing to accept now they are basically cooked you dont trade that high up in the first round without paying a price
4562664 how can i go into the locker room and tell my guys we just gave a rookie more money than weve ever given anyone
4562665 when i did my new deal i could have squeezed them for more
4562666 but i was cognizant of what tom brady did in new england he could have gotten more too but he knew like i do that a team needs money to sign all the other players you need to win we traded up for a guy and we have to be willing to pay that slotted price i know it works both ways but thats the system the business were in
4562667 i got to throw to jerry a lot in the offseason and i found out that he is really easy to throw to he gives a quarterback great looks and great angles its like if i put it somewhere near him hes going to make the catch i really think that jerry can be the receiver that jimmy smith used to be for this team
4562668 but im not standing out here pounding my chest about what i great decision i made
4562669 we had to do something for our team and it made the most sense
4562670 i believe most of us feel that jack is a great coach
4562671 he was pretty tough when he first got here but we know what to expect of him now as a player all you can ask is for there to be no curveballs coming at you we know where we stand with jack weve become a team thats now on the nfl radar from one that wasnt even on it our goal this year is win more than just one playoff game
4562672 at a time when world records seemed to have hit the ceiling of whats physically possible to wrestle out of the human organism phelps has been the man who managed to push the limits with his magnificent performance
4562673 any average adult human being needs some 2 500 daily calories to live a life without excesses
4562674 of course when youre in the presence of a monster like michael phelps those parameters can go to hell
4562675 the all time no 1 olympian or just one of many such belt holders
4562676 the latter is my conclusion because numbers of golds won is only one criterion by which to weigh olympic greatness not least because of the sheer number of scarcely distinguishable events open to swimmers though phelps will move another giant step towards the all time title on sunday if he puts spitz in the shade
4562677 we couldnt care less whether hes the greatest olympian ever
4562678 the truth is hes costing us a fortune and punters bettors just love him if phelps comes to london in 2012 theres a strong chance he could clean up again frankly were already dreading it
4562679 if michael phelps were a country he would be sitting fourth on the games medal tally
4562680 every olympiad produces its own titans athletes whose performances galvanize the worlds attention and whose names become synonymous in olympic history with the cities and years of their triumphs
4562681 in that sense beijing 2008 will always belong to michael phelps
4562682 that michael phelps can take a three minute shower in 2 minutes
4562683 the volts chief engineer is on a tight schedule to figure out how the car will handle the batteries weight dissipate their heat and mechanically transfer their power to the wheels
4562684 she seeks wool and flax and works with willing hands
4562685 when i saw her score come up i knew i couldnt score six tenths higher
4562686 so going into floor i didnt care about score or placement anymore i just wanted to finish my olympic experience as best i could
4562687 nastia has been around a long time and has a lot of experience and she deserves the gold
4562688 as the world is distracted by russias unimpeded incursion into georgia the sudanese are using the geopolitical pandemonium as cover to launch assaults on rebel held areas of north darfur rebel leaders are alleging that the military action was undertaken to clear space for and while that little chestnut didnt make a1 above the fold of the new york times this week mia farrow god bless her for her vigilance on this issue is on it and on the ground in darfur fighting on the side of the angels
4562689 accept the orders that we give you in sleep when you are awake do what we have dictated and forget that we gave you these orders in sleep
4562690 to pay a 10 cent dividend which is 30 million is nice but its not what we wanted they should have authorized a 1 billion buyback and they would use incremental cash flows to fund it they clearly did not listen to shareholders
4562691 theres no more time outs the game is on the line here
4562692 we have to radically revamp our lineups create cleaner technology and work with others to develop new energy new fuelling stations and smarter roads
4562693 great ideas will not only rescue us from the current downturn theyll help us meet the even greater challenges that lie ahead

4562749 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one
4562750 that represents a tremendous shift from 2000 when the military vote almost certainly was decisive in florida and elsewhere and leaned heavily towards the republicans
4562751 thats shocking the academic debate is between some who say that junior enlisted ranks lean slightly republican and some who say its about equal but no one would point to six to one

4562753 we developed the program to address the deficits that we see in females especially weakness in the lateral hip muscles the glutes and the core muscles
4562754 if its half as good as they say it is its worth doing
4562755 what here but the brides about to roll up her dress and take that frilly thing off her leg
4562756 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4562757 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4562758 ive tried to play this game for as long as i can
4562759 i make mistakes but i try to do it with integrity so my parents would be proud of the way i played if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4562760 hes too good of a player to do something like that and to act like that theys why its disappointing because he is a great player i cant take anything away from the fact he won the match
4562761 we were on the court like 2 1 2 hours i was really tired i didnt feel anything
4562762 watch them almost break all of the rules and get down and dirty order now and get your free at amp t telecom immunity tote bag
4562763 protest zones im an unabashed obama supporter but as much as i like him i like the rights to free speech and free association even more the dems shouldve rejected the idea of free speech zones outright as a symbol of the constitution hating bush
4562764 what about the security concerns of the protesters they want to secure the bill of rights they want to secure peace and an end to foreign occupations they want to secure themselves from arrest for bullsh t crimes i guess these are the rare cases where the freedom to tyranize trumps security
4562765 it was one of the best qualifying attempts ive had on an oval this year
4562766 its difficult to pass on this track and starting up front is very important
4562767 we had a great test here a couple of weeks ago thanks to afs andretti green for giving me a car capable of winning the pole
4562768 i got a little bit high and it was pretty scary
4562769 my team sam schmidt motorsports has a lot of experience on ovals and theyve made it easy for me to learn how to drive on them
4562770 i won it at the start when i managed to get a good tow off ana beatriz who started outside on the front row ahead of battistini
4562771 the momentum carried me past matos and it put me in strong position to win the race
4562772 we deserved a good finish because weve been strong on ovals of late
4562773 i want to thank the team and sponsor lifelock and tim neff team engineer

4563062 how the lifeguards set the flags varies depending on where the location of the breaks are which are the waves the surfers will want to play on
4563063 depending on the direction of the swells the breaks vary rather than creating conflict and putting a flag in the swim area they may narrow that swim area at their at discretion
4563064 if the entire beach was a swim area it would not be reasonable the guards cant focus on the entire stretch they do observe the entire area but try to place their attention mostly on the swimming area
4563065 there always has been issues between the surfers and the swimmers
4563066 and with the recent explosion in the interest of surfing its become a problem there is a sense that more of the beach is being reserved for surfers than swimmers and some think its disproportionate
4563067 maybe on days when surfing is not optimal make a better swim area
4563068 when surfing is optimal then the swimming area would be smaller

4563110 the senate failed to reach the 60 votes needed to end gop blockage of a bill s 3268 directing the commodity futures trading commission to curb excessive speculation in the oil futures market in part by setting higher margin requirements requiring more public disclosure and working more closely with regulators from other countries the agency has authority under existing law to determine whether market prices for commodities accurately reflect supply and demand the bill was aimed at pure speculators rather than companies such as transportation firms that trade in oil futures as a business decision
4563111 senate democrats tried to curb the rampant speculation that experts say is part of the reason gas prices are so high they were blocked by mr mcconnell and his gop followers there is a critical domestic issue and the senate had a chance to start doing something about it by handcuffing the speculators who have milked this crisis for all its worth to them but mitch mcconnell and his crowd said no
4563112 waived regulations over the past decade on u s investors who trade commodities on some overseas markets freeing those investors to accumulate large quantities of the future oil supply by making purchases on lightly regulated foreign exchanges

4563114 demand for so called paper barrels of oil bought merely for quick financial speculation has added 25 to 50 percent to the price of crude according to numerous experts and economists these critics arent populist cranks they include oil company ceos who agree speculation is disrupting prices in the worst way the only ones denying the problem are the investment banks that are raking in major profits and the bush administration the white house sees nothing wrong with wild price swings enriching the investment houses that brought us the subprime mortgage crisis while average citizens not only have to worry about keeping their houses but filling their tanks to get back and forth to work
4563115 soaring fuel prices that are burning a hole in the wallets of consumers are not only benefiting oil companies and middle eastern producers they are also lighting up the investment returns of pensions sic funds which millions of ordinary americans are counting on for their retirement these funds are part of a tidal wave of investment dollars that has flooded commodity markets in recent years and critics say contributed to the run up in prices investors including pension funds and wall street speculators have sharply increased their commodity allocations since 2003 from 13 billion to 260 billion making financial actors an even larger force on these markets than farmers airlines trucking firms and companies that buy and sell the physical goods to run their businesses
4563116 there were no unexpected changes in industry fundamentals in the last 12 months when crude oil prices were below 65 per barrel i cannot think of any reason that explains the run up in crude oil price beside excessive speculation

4563151 i love going up in the mountains in september here to see the yellows of the willows and the orange of the blueberries and the red of the bearberries and the purpley fireweed
4563152 one of the things that is really critical is cool nights
4563153 starting in september if it starts to get cool but not below freezing if you have clear cool days and cool nights it stimulates fall color
4563154 its all a pattern but its never the same which is whats really cool about it
4563155 fall will begin mid august and it will be peaking there the end of august and first week of september
4563156 and then all of a sudden those bright colors are gone and youre into winter pretty quickly
4563157 we have a more temperate climate the fall colors kick in about the third week of september and into the first week of october
4563158 are always the first to sell out the high demand for the last part of august is because of the fall colors
4563159 near the coast is the last place youll find color
4563160 from mid september to late october we see a variation of fall color rolling through from the western upper peninsula to the southeastern portion of the state

4563279 the other day we were in five man pro and he take it 45 yards down the sideline for a touchdown and outruns the guy who had the angle on him
4563280 from where i was standing on the field it was impressive it looked like he was going to get hit but he took it past him and got the angle
4563281 were still in a general deal right now but you can really see his athleticism when he gets a chance to get out there and run around

4563287 is the republican party no longer the party of personal freedom and individual responsibility why has this party that used to protect my rights now become the party that wants to create a nanny state stay away from issues of personal liberty except to remove old laws that restrict these liberties
4563288 allow americans the freedom to play poker on the internet its embarrassing that certain segments of the republican party are imposing their morality on the country if i choose to play poker or another game of skill on the internet what business is it of the governments please take us back to the republican party of limited government this issue will be the deciding factor in who i vote for in the upcoming election please support bills like hr 5657
4563289 i want you to support my right to play online poker this is a billion dollar industry and there is no reason why it cannot be regulated
4563290 i find it deplorable that we have legalized lotteries horse amp dog race betting bingo lotto casinos everywhere but we cant have legalized online poker all weve done is drive the online poker sites offshore foreign countries are reaping the tax amp business revenues as a result of this flawed policy
4563291 i have never been a single issue voter but if the republican party continues its opposition to the regulation of online gambling i will vote for someone other than senator mccain clearly regulation and taxation is the correct position on this issue
4563292 as a lifelong republican i believe in personal responsibility choosing to gamble on the internet should be a personal choice not a decision the government makes for us in 2004 the party platform took the position that government should ban internet gambling i enjoy playing poker on the internet and if the party platform were to advocate banning internet gambling this election season i would seriously consider voting for obama
4563293 i am a long time supporter of conservative views i support the right of mature adult citizens to continue my freedoms to exercise free choice in how i spend my time and recreational moneys i support the right to participate in and play poker i object to the reduction in my personal freedoms so someone can push his her moral agenda my country asked me to participate in the struggle to protect our freedoms so i became a part of the military service and fought in viet nam and was honorably discharged why are the few pushing so hard to reduce the freedoms of so many adults who want to play poker

4563313 its hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys sometimes with all the marketing hype
4563314 path plays a critical role in screening so independent contractors can feel secure in their choice of host and simply select the host that meets their particular business needs to become successful todays travel professional should be focusing on knowledge education and building a relationship with the customer while selling the experience if your host is not encouraging this you need to step back and reevaluate your choice in hosts
4563315 it is imperative the industry recognizes the difference between the legitimate host agencies and the multilevel marketing and card mill organizations noted mysza since the right host agency can provide an ideal environment for these independent travel professionals to thrive and grow if it sounds too good to be true it probably is

4563362 he was only there for last season and obviously he wants to get into the spanish national team and you cant deny playing in the premier league is going to give him a better opportunity of that
4563363 i think from rangers perspective they brought him in for just over 2 million and sold him for 8m thats a good bit of business but obviously the supporters dont see it like that and they are bitterly disappointed to have lost one of their better players

4563383 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4563443 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4563444 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4563445 they create a good atmosphere its only in the last few years weve seen things like this

4563481 georgias economic growth will be much reduced and foreign investment that has been so important to georgias fundamentals could be revised
4563482 we cannot say georgias economy has been physically damaged but there is the matter of risk and the impairment of confidence
4563483 we think that ukraine may be the next investment casualty because it was asked in a veiled fashion if it wants to join nato and russias actions hark back to the cold war and the desire to retain spheres of influence on its borders

4563503 when the crowds saw what paul had done they raised their voice saying in the lycaonian language the gods have become like men and have come down to us and they began calling barnabas zeus and paul hermes because he was the chief speaker the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds
4563504 but false prophets also arose among the people just as there will also be false teachers among you who will secretly introduce destructive heresies even denying the master who bought them bringing swift destruction upon themselves
4563505 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming and now it is already in the world
4563506 who is the liar but the one who denies that jesus is the christ this is the antichrist the one who denies the father and the son
4563507 for if one comes and preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or you receive a different spirit which you have not received or a different gospel which you have not accepted you bear this beautifully
4563508 for christ also died for sins once for all the just for the unjust so that he might bring us to god having been put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit
4563509 but god demonstrates his own love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us much more then having now been justified by his blood we shall be saved from the wrath of god through him
4563510 for i delivered to you as of first importance what i also received that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures
4563511 but if there is no resurrection of the dead not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised then our preaching is vain your faith also is vain moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of god because we testified against god that he raised christ whom he did not raise if in fact the dead are not raised for if the dead are not raised not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised your faith is worthless you are still in your sins then those also who have fallen asleep in christ have perished if we have hoped in christ in this life only we are of all men most to be pitied
4563512 thus the covenant that god made with the jewish people through moses remains eternally valid for them
4563513 to the jewish people whom god first chose to hear his word belong the sonship the glory the covenants the giving of the law the worship and the promises to them belong the patriarchs and of their race according to the flesh is the christ
4563514 catholics understand that all previous covenants that god made with the jewish people have been fulfilled in jesus christ through the new covenant established through his sacrificial death on the cross
4563515 might be understood to imply that one of the former covenants imparts salvation without the mediation of christ whom christians believe to be the universal savior of all people
4563516 the catechism is not the place where you work out difficult theological problems
4563517 are in a real relationship with god based on a covenant that has never been revoked
4563518 all covenants with israel find fulfillment in christ who is the savior of all
4563519 it is also the churchs understanding that the full incorporation of israel into the saving covenant of christ may be the fruit of the end times may not happen until the end of history

4563553 the casinos ameristar in particular its a very clever attempt by them to hide behind the children of this state
4563554 its very deceptive because at first glance it looks like its going to help elementary and secondary education in the state
4563555 its a mystery as to why they tried to pick so many issues and put them into one ballot issue
4563556 the other issue worth noting is the state constitution requires that gaming proceeds also must go to higher education
4563557 an economic downturn that is having an unprecedented negative effect on newspaper revenues and our financial health
4563558 we have taken many steps to reorganize and streamline operations to respond to these economic challenges
4563559 yet its clear we will need to do more to control expenses
4563560 mcclatchy has avoided taking this step as long as possible
4563561 and i know this freeze comes at a particularly hard time when the economy is putting stress on your personal expenses and when you are working hard to adapt to our changing business model these efforts now and others in the future will ensure the stars ability to operate as a stable and financially prosperous multimedia company
4563562 the problem with social security is that it used to be for every 55 people putting money into it there was one taking out and now it seems that for every two people there is one taking it out
4563563 the government is afraid to try and fix any of the problems with social security because they are afraid they will step on peoples toes no matter how they attempt to make the change
4563564 this decision is a result of the current economic climate and the fact that we are slowing the growth of our new store openings and reducing corporate expenses

4563573 the darfur olympics has been a 7 day demonstration to provide for the people of darfur to receive some attention during chinas extravagant celebration of itself as olympic host
4563574 the demonstration featured an alternative opening ceremony on august 8 a daily webcast by mia farrow from a refugee camp august 9 to 14 and an online action aimed at the olympic corporate sponsors the chinese government blocked access in beijing to dream for darfurs websites
4563575 the closing ceremony features footage of life in a refugee camp juxtaposed with images of chinese propaganda
4563576 the images from the refugee camps show the anguish china underwrites even as beijing tries to present a different image to the world china was not able to escape its murderous record in darfur during these games said
4563577 given these trends risks to the outlook for the world oil market appear to be on the downside

4563607 the track is lightning fast and were witnessing the tiger woods of track and field
4563608 he has the ability to break the world records at 100 200 and 400 metres and not just break them but smash them
4563609 ive seen this kid since he was 14 years old and theres nothing new happening with him now
4563610 look at his basic physics hes taller his levers are longer look at the dynamics its obvious that he has put the work in im going to have no problem when he takes my olympic record
4563611 to come to the olympic games and make the semi final is fantastic
4563612 i can only hope that i surprise a few people im very confident of making the final when people doubt me and put pressure on me thats when im at my best
4563613 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4563614 copyright licenses are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right
4563615 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition indeed because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative these types of license restrictions might well be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief
4563616 the court has held that free licenses such as the creative commons or cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4563617 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4563618 the gpl is another example of a license that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright license not a contract although this model train case is about a different license because the united states is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters
4563619 cair spokesman ibrahim hooper said the islamic organization had nothing whatsoever to do with any threats and that any allegations to that effect would be scurrilous

4563624 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
4563625 they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4563626 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
4563627 there is no obligation to provide this information yet theres no penalty so obviously they are not getting a lot of information
4563628 the agency has recommended that indirect effects are included in future sustainability reporting and is working with the government to identify a way to do this
4563629 the shocking admission that we are unable to identify the origin of nearly half the biofuels used in the u k means that the government cannot assure the british people that the biofuels in their petrol tanks have not destroyed rainforests
4563630 it is really good that theyre asking these questions now when the mandate is a very small amount
4563631 never look down to test the ground before taking your next step
4563632 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4563633 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4563634 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4563635 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4563636 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4563637 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4563638 in the years since its gained independence after the soviet unions collapse georgias become a courageous democracy
4563639 its people are making the tough choices that are required of free societies since the rose revolution in 2003 the georgian people have held free elections opened up their economy and built the foundations of a successful democracy
4563640 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4563641 there were about 60 crewmen sitting around eating salami sandwiches
4563642 im feeling very tired the first time around i could put my feet up and relax this time i have a baby to run after and carry
4563643 i point to my belly and tell her theres a baby in my belly
4563644 she points to her belly button and thinks theres a baby there

4563648 the article itself is a nice one but it follows headlines that in no way represent my words or feelings i do not feel betrayed by audrina or conrads ex brody jenner i love them both and said nothing to contradict this
4563649 shes very good friends with these people she goes out to dinner with them and so does audrina so lauren definitely wasnt happy when she saw this cover
4563650 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim

4563655 the manner by which alcohol is used within the home setting sends the child or teener very strong signals
4563656 as a parent it is important to really take time out and know your child
4563657 its good practice to keep an alcohol based hand sanitizer in ones bag or pockets unless necessary keep young children away from malls and crowded places
4563658 studied the effects of various types of taxes on the economic growth of developed nations within the oecd and found that corporate taxes are found to be most harmful for growth followed by personal income taxes and then consumption taxes
4563659 is an international organisation of thirty countries that accept the principles of representative democracy and free market economy it originated in 1948 to help administer the marshall plan
4563660 the main recommendation of the study is that if countries want to enhance their economic growth they would do well to move away from income taxes especially corporate income taxes toward less distortive taxes such as consumption based taxes
4563661 the study is particularly timely in light of the new oecd rankings of corporate taxes among the 30 oecd nations it shows that the u s continues to have the 2nd highest overall corporate tax rate among industrialized countries only japan has a higher overall rate
4563662 worst of all since nine countries cut their corporate tax rates this year the overall oecd average fell by a full percentage point from 27 6 percent to 26 6 percent this means that the u s rate is now 50 percent higher than the oecd average this should be a wake up call to washington that our long term economic health is in jeopardy as long as corporate rates remain so far out of step with our major economic competitors
4563663 me siento muy complacida porque es un premio al talento es un premio del estado venezolano pero sobre todo porque me han premiado en humanidades y por primera vez se reconoce en esta rama del premio a una mujer

4563683 enable the airlines to reduce costs and attract new customers helping to mitigate pressure on airfares from record fuel costs
4563684 we do not agree with the faas findings and characterizations of americans action in these cases we believe the proposed penalties are excessive

4563690 average roundtrip cost of jet fuel todays prices is about 300 per passenger we would have to charge about 650 700 a passenger to break even
4563691 fares probably need to increase at this point another 15 20 percent before airlines cover their costs

4563705 the latest scientific tests in the us prove the mercury in one broken bulb can irreparably contaminate a carpet in the us insurance companies are refusing to cover the cost of replacing carpets
4563706 it is normal for cfl bulbs to physically burn up at the end of their natural life although rare in some cases this has led to house fires
4563707 physically burn up at the end of their natural life
4563708 the burnt plastic and gases emitted when lights burn out are carcinogenic
4563709 although many bulbs claim 6 000 hours five years use or greater this is based on ideal laboratory conditions some bulbs have died within 12 months in household use
4563710 household cfls are widely known to cause interference to wireless networks electronic appliances hot water cylinders and cordless phones
4563711 nz government briefing papers disclose major concerns that cfls could cause regular widespread power outages because of a peculiar side effect known as harmonic distortion
4563712 some us states now require homeowners to drive old cfl bulbs to a special recycling centre to avoid contaminating the environment

4563750 it felt good to swing it to our side a little bit
4563751 my interpretation is this was probably the result of poor information given to the athlete who did not have the knowledge of what to avoid and what she was allowed to take

4563757 some of these drugs work unbelievably well to the point where you cant compete against someone if you dont take them no matter how talented you are
4563758 is like the story of the dutch boy who puts his finger in a hole in the dike but then another hole pops up
4563759 its a large task but this group can do that
4563760 next couple of days heads down butts up and lets put this thing to bed agreed
4563761 the issue is how do we do it how do you put the fire back in were still struggling with that
4563762 like i told someone a while ago fighting fire is the easy part
4563763 fire was fine to burn across the park naturally and do the things mother nature meant to do until we had full suppression at old faithful
4563764 and then we do full suppression here and there and then were doing full suppression all over
4563765 the safety of the public and the employees is paramount
4563766 this is a fire were managing to minimize the risk to the firefighters
4563767 there may be a secondary benefit to the forest but its certainly not an objective
4563768 were not going over that in fact thats coming down over the next few days
4563769 believe it or not they know what you are doin and they like what you are doin
4563770 you can go into remote rugged areas and know where you are
4563771 driving through the park it just broke my heart i had no idea of the extent of the fires the logs are still black making it look like it just happened
4563772 it is wonderful to see how nature is working to rebuild itself
4563773 the public and even some ecologists feared that the 1988 fires had produced a desolate area of uniform devestation but this was not the case
4563774 instead one of the most striking features was the post fire heterogeneity of the burned landscape
4563775 wild fires look bad at first but the area comes back nice and green and that is good for the animals
4563776 contrary to what a lot of people believe fire is actually good for wildlife
4563777 we found numbers ranging from 15 000 to 2 million seeds per acre being put out on the landscape
4563778 the fire came through here and we had ash about 18 inches deep
4563779 this place looked like the bottom of a barbecue grill it was nuked there is no other description people said we would be lucky to get anything to grow here now the quickest growing trees in the park are right here some are already 18 feet
4563780 we were distressed by the fact the park rangers had let it burn
4563781 i know they had their reasons but it was hard to believe they were good reasons with all the flames and scorched wood on the news every night
4563782 you see it today and you think maybe they were right after all
4563783 it seems like a phenomena that has happened once a century for the past three centuries
4563784 if i was a betting man id say that sometime this century there will be another fire event along the same line we just probably wont be around to see it
4563785 and just in case that keller gets the wrong idea or you cant shake the habit of dropping in to the infirmary to make out with the medic in charge i think i should use this its always best to state your intentions right from the beginning dont you think
4563786 you know jan i think i may just get that tattooed on my butt
4563787 writing reports is so much easier knowing youre here i dont know if i can do it jan i dont know if i can be away from you for all that time i even miss you when youre here with me and i have to focus on my work instead of on you im a mess jan
4563788 youll be okay sam i know it youre the bravest and strongest person i know you can do it baby and ill see you all the time dont forget that well be okay
4563789 of all the things i know honey thats the one im clearest on we can survive anything and well come out even stronger are you all done baby i want to take you home i want to enjoy our last weekend together for a while weve got the guys coming over for lunch on sunday so i want to make the most of the time we have alone
4563790 im done honey and im sorry i know this is probably harder on you than it is on me itll all be fine i know it and youll be coming out in three weeks wont you
4563791 undomesticated equines as tealc would say wouldnt keep me away
4563792 of course i dont mind and i think we should pick up some take out on the way back and then well get an early night
4563793 surely you wouldnt refuse me a small mouthful of food would you colonel
4563794 nothin to be sorry for sweetie want to go again
4563795 i think i could do just about anything as long as i can come back to you afterward
4563796 i think id wait for you for ever and longer
4563797 and well have all this to look forward to imagine how great well be together after three dry weeks itll be worth waiting for sam im sure of that
4563798 i dont have to do this now i dont want mom to be on her own i know how badly she misses you even on short missions ill catch the next plane back
4563799 it was your moms decision i wasnt going to go and she persuaded me she says they need me more there and if you came back shed be really pissed she knows we both know that this trip is the best thing for you right now so you mustnt interrupt it well be fine anyway weve already got plans to get together every few weeks and we both still plan to meet you half way through your trip ill get vacation
4563800 thats great i hate packing im setting up a secure email jan
4563801 whenever the gate opens from the midway station any emails from me will be forwarded and vice versa ive set up a buffer system at midway to store all electronic communications to and from earth and atlantis the systems completely encrypted so we dont have to worry about anybody else reading the messages so you can write what you want baby
4563802 thats good sam i expect i may want to use the email to get rid of my frustrations
4563803 one step at a time remember dont think of it as being apart for 18 months only for a few weeks at a time and well make up for lost time when were together
4563804 and well take those two weeks in november when we meet up with cass i cant wait for that
4563805 and thats one of the reasons i plan to head out there regularly
4563806 i know you have baby i know you have whatcha want to do shall we just talk
4563807 catch up on your sleep at midway if i give you something will you swear to me that youll take it when you get there you need to be at full strength when you take over at atlantis honey
4563808 how about you tell me something i dont know about you and ill tell you something you dont know about me
4563809 you know everything about me sam i cant think of anything you dont know
4563810 something you remember from your childhood that youve never told anybody
4563811 i remember being in my stroller with an orange blanket i loved that blanket i slept with it for years but yes i think thats my first memory chewing the corner of that orange blanket as my mom pushed me in the stroller i suppose thats why orange is my favorite color to this day i wonder what happened to that blanket i must ask mom if shes still got it somewhere
4563812 i like that i like the idea of you at that age you know i dont think ive ever seen a photo of you that young i think in the earliest photograph ive seen youre about six
4563813 mom and dad lost several albums in a house fire
4563814 so there arent many of me at that age but there are some im sure ill see if mom can find anything and if she does ill bring a photograph with me to atlantis i promise
4563815 but youll probably laugh my first memory is of bubbles
4563816 you know those little pots of bubbles with the stick with a hoop you blow bubbles out of it i remember mark blowing those at me when i was just a young kid i remember wondering even then how bubbles could exist i mean its not like i knew anything about surface tension then they just seemed like magic to me
4563817 but i remember reaching out and the bubble burst in my hand i thought id broken the magic that id done something terrible i remember i cried for hours only mom understood why i was so upset but i remember that feeling so clearly something had gone wrong and would be forever missing i mean
4563818 i got over it but when mom died it was as though i was having the same feelings and i recognized it something was wrong and would never be right again
4563819 and that feeling never really went away not until i met you
4563820 ive never felt that way since you complete me janet
4563821 but im not now i know youll always be there and well talk every day so the feelings not the same this time well never really be apart even if we are in different galaxies for a while
4563822 i want you all to know how honored i am to accept this appointment
4563823 i ve come here fully committed to this expedition to atlantis and most importantly to each and every one of you i look forward to working with all of you thank you

4563826 its an interesting read for the process and the ingenuity seen within it heres the thing the main storyline and the high concept is just the rod in your closet its all the clothes hanging off the rod some neatly pressed others slightly wrinkled with character that are the interesting parts the plot is an excuse to have scenes of characters talking about different things and one or two big set piece car chase and crash things even better the author knows this relies on it and invites you to revel in it with him dont pay attention to the rod look at the hangers the black diamond get in the car and go is another piece of experimental high concept storytelling from the word processor of larry young if youre into this kind of thing youll enjoy the book if you want a straight up high octane summer blockbuster action thriller this ones not going to work for you go read that monster attack network book instead or the original the black diamond would be an excellent platform to spin such an action thriller off of
4563827 what writer larry young has created is a framework to build a whole slew of stories upon as illustrated by various artists in the back up features its a highway with no rules there is no speed limit and its populated by gearheads bikers and gangs of road warriors this spells trouble for dr mclaughlin who has to use the highway to make it across the country asap in order to rescue his wife i especially like the trippy ending of this over the top road movie of a book in that final chapter alone artist jon proctor earns his artistic wings of accomplishment with his stunning splash pages and iconic imagery
4563828 but calling it a quest is a bit highfalutin this story with its qt esque dialogue and non stop muscle car action is strictly 1973 drive in fare all the way a spiritual cousin of such double feature diamonds as

4563842 if there was any constant in my life it was muscle shoals

4563872 that spring there were twenty men employed in grenepark the farm was and is over four hundred acres and very little mechanization was then to be had and almost no system of contracting today i doubt if it needs more than five or six men to run it the laborers in 1929 had for years earned twenty five shillings a week one pound five nicholas decided that at the rate he was paying the place would go bankrupt so he did a most unusual thing then he called the men together explained the situation and told them that if they could all take ten shillings hed be very glad to keep them the alternative was to reduce the total staff to ten men at a pound a week they were to decide they unanimously decided to take the cut and stay
4563873 he had a little house in town and was himself funny and appealing in a very special sort of way

4563875 copyright holders who engage in open source licensing have the right to control the modification and distribution of copyrighted material
4563876 copyright licenses are designed to support the right to exclude money damages alone do not support or enforce that right
4563877 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements of disclosure and explanation of changes rather than as a dollar denominated fee is entitled to no less legal recognition indeed because a calculation of damages is inherently speculative these types of license restrictions might well be rendered meaningless absent the ability to enforce through injunctive relief
4563878 the court has held that free licenses such as the creative commons or cc licenses set conditions rather than covenants on the use of copyrighted work
4563879 when you violate the condition the license disappears meaning youre simply a copyright infringer this is the theory of the gpl general public license and all cc licenses put precisely whether or not they are also contracts they are copyright licenses which expire if you fail to abide by the terms of the license
4563880 the gpl is another example of a license that depends on copyright law for enforcement because its a copyright license not a contract although this model train case is about a different license because the united states is a legal system based in part on case law every decision matters

4563884 would you tell us a story before we go to bed
4563885 alright ill tell you the story of great hero who lived many many years ago
4563886 yes grandfather we know the story well but we want a different story tonight
4563887 grandfather could you please tell us the story of the secret swan that one is our favorite
4563888 in the days of old long before the earth had changed the emperor sent out word throughout the world for all of the athletes of all nations to come to bei jing to compete in the last ah lim pia
4563889 oh i think they had changed the title to something like president but it was really just like being an emperor whenever he gave an order the people obeyed his name was emperor hu
4563890 when the word of the emperors invitation reached the land we call mei kuo the land of the fragrant trees many athletes responded and it was they who would present the greatest challenge to the gymnasts of chung kuo
4563891 the emperor hu had chosen the youngest and best gymnasts among the chung kuo people and they had trained very hard for the honor of the country the chung kuo team and the mei kuo team battled back and forth until finally there were only the best from each side left and lo and behold na sti ah was among the finalists of course everyone was surprised that she had survived the competition so far but everyone knew the team from our land was the best
4563892 yes ah mei it was then when all seemed to favor the young athletes from our land that na sti ah began to use her swan skills she flew from bar to bar she stepped ever so lightly on the balance beam she soared supremely in the air in the vaulting place and then finally when the two teams were almost tied she leaped and twisted and turned across the floor with such grace and agility that even our gymnasts were stunned for none of them possessed the skills of a swan
4563893 that was a long time ago chee hock no one remembers all that happened but most authorities believe that after some time her wish having been granted she turned back into a swan today you can still see her descendents gliding above the waters or cruising softly along with the currents they say that if you go to the waters edge and you see a swan it will always look at you for a few moments as if it is waiting for you to say something
4563894 it seems like a matter of surrogacy said deputy commissioner zone 8 nisar tamboli
4563895 whatever the case might be the passport has to document the details accurately we managed to track them only because of a specific tip off he added
4563896 this is good news said maria lahood of the new york based center for constitutional rights lawyer who represents arar
4563897 we are getting another shot and certainly the court thinks mistakes were made in the original ruling
4563898 this means maher may finally get justice in this country
4563899 this decision indicates the court is at least interested in investigating it further she said
4563900 whoever initiated this had very strong views on the matter
4563901 i wouldnt say it was probable but if i was his lawyer i would be excited she said
4563902 sending him to canada could have posed a threat to our country mukasey said
4563903 cma canada has long seen the attraction and retention of talented foreign students as a key element of improving human capital and enhancing canadas productivity record
4563904 these recent graduates are at the leading edge of the innovation talent and intelligence needed to help grow canadian companies increase productivity growth and compete in a global economy the government of canada is to be commended for this important productivity initiative
4563905 will enhance canadas ability to compete with other countries to attract and retain the best foreign students
4563906 it doesnt make sense to spend money training the brightest foreign students in the world only to have them leave canada and contribute to the economies of other countries at our expense

4563958 this guy is really the right guy for right time
4563959 hes done a spectacular job hes no bs he looks you in the eye he tells you what he believes sometimes you dont want to hear it but ive always thought the most difficult thing back when i was running a company or the current world that were in now is to have people that tell you the truth
4563960 when ed skyler he is now a deputy mayor but when he was the press secretary he would get in the car and scream at me and stu loeser gets in the car and you look at the two detectives in the front seat and i can see them exchanging glances theyve never seen anybody yell at the mayor
4563961 and stu is let me tell you this about stu loser not nice let me tell you one other thing anytime stu loeser yells at me i dont make the same mistake twice that is the most valuable thing for any manager is to have somebody that has the courage to tell you that youre making a mistake and in a ways that you dont forget it no sugar coating no nonsense
4563962 thats why stu loeser is the best press secretary anybody could ever have and why skyler was so valuable before
4563963 and even now skyler sits maybe four feet away for me and when skyler turns and starts working me over patty harris my first deputy mayor cringes i cringe secretaries cringe but you dont make the same mistake

4563976 i think there has been a lot of hubris at the ecb they took a derisory attitude towards the us saying the federal reserve was too aggressive in cutting rates now they are reaping the bitter reward of their policy
4563977 the confidence expressed by some observers that weaker economic growth will lead to a damping of inflation pressures is in my opinion premature
4563978 they boxed themselves in and it became hard to retreat it is clear from the august bulletin that they have now really woken up to the downturn
4563979 recessions in europe are very nasty events they tend to be a lot deeper and more protracted than in the us which is better able to cope with the ups and downs of the business cycle
4563980 the bursting of the emu credit bubble seems imminent and will reveal current account imbalances among euro area countries as extremely dangerous the medium term feasibility of the euro area in its current form must be open to very considerable doubt

4564034 maloneys law has excellent pace and a rich sense of place as it eases its way into the criminal world anne brooke knows her london and understands the motives of both the good and the bad the clever insider knowledge helps to keep you on tenterhooks but this is more than another gay crime novel it touches on very powerful emotions and there are some heartrending moments one cant help liking paul maloney and his laws that mark him out ultimately in his true colours a further precept might be added to those laws all it takes to make a town good or make it what you see is for good people to do nothing and paul maloney is not one of those good people he is in the final assessment a man of heart despite his statement that friendship is better than love and of integrity he is a man of principle a thought provoking book

4564048 he played a major role in bringing black music to the masses and in the evolution of rhythm and blues to soul music
4564049 beyond that he really developed the role of the record producer jerry did a lot more than just turn on a tape recorder he left his stamp on a lot of great music he had a commercial ear as well as a critical ear
4564050 he was incredibly abrasive and incredibly generous very abrupt and very very patient seemingly a pure sharklike businessman and also a cerebral and creative genius

4564053 we used to close the book on a friday and come back to work on a tuesday
4564054 one friday the editor got us together and said listen lets change this from race records a lot of people were beginning to find it inappropriate come back with some ideas on tuesday
4564055 one guy said this and one guy said that and i said rhythm and blues and they said oh that sounds pretty good lets do that in the next issue that section came out as rhythm and blues instead of race
4564056 when i said i wanted to sing like that jerry said the best way was to get a pianist and learn how those songs are done
4564057 one thing jerry wexler taught me was that if youve got a sexy or torchy song you mustnt attitudinize on top of it because it sounds redundant

4564063 and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
4564064 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time
4564065 the priest may in a certain manner be called the creator of his creator since by saying the words of the consecration he creates as it were jesus in the sacrament by giving him a sacramental existence and produces him as a victim to be offered to the eternal father as in creating the world it is sufficient for god to have said let it be made and it was created so it is sufficient for the priest to say hoc est corpus meum and behold the bread is no longer bread but the body of jesus christ the power of the priest says st bernadine of sienna is the power of the divine person for the transubstantiation of the bread requires as much power as the creation of the world the priest has the power of delivering sinners from hell of making them worthy of paradise and of changing them from the slaves of satan into the children of god and god himself is obliged to abide by the judgement of his priests and either not to pardon or to pardon according as they refuse or give absolution provided the penitent is capable of it

4564070 the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends toward justice
4564071 there have always been those who have held that life is property that cannot possibly arise out of inanimate matter not because they cant conceive of the chemical pathway but because it offends their view of the universe this is the life is something special

4564127 these are robust and vary accordingly to the type and sensitivity of the individual postings
4564128 we take matters of security very seriously and if any issues arise about individuals they may be subject to further assessment
4564129 this could lead to restrictions being put in place relating to where an individual may work within the organisation or could lead to their dismissal

4564134 as at today we have an oil reserve base of 33 6 billion barrels
4564135 obstructions and incidents that militated against realisation of full potential of the country in terms of crude oil production
4564136 maintained at an average of two million barrels per day
4564137 it was very disturbing a few weeks ago when for the first time nigerias daily oil production dropped to below 1 8 million barrels per day

4564150 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4564151 to create peace to increase the separation between the forces and to stop not the war between our armed forces and georgias but between georgian and ossetian civilians and to stop the war between bandits
4564152 we now have an increasing area of russian occupation of our territory
4564153 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4564154 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4564155 she madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human but think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him

4564179 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

4564181 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4564182 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4564183 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4564184 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4564185 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4564188 i realize that the yankees and red sox are the only teams the baseball gods truly love but for the love of kevin costner give the angels some respect
4564189 i am sick and tired of seeing only the cubs on espns baseball coverage its either the red sox vs yankees or the cubs vs someone
4564190 it is long proven in nba and nfl and mlb that spreading the wealth to 30 or 32 teams is a prescription for deflating ratings
4564191 the equity approach might have been possible 30 years ago but now that there is such a surplus of games to watch on network and cable the mandate is no longer to get everyone on
4564192 and no 2 is following the best stories in baseball and 2 will usually drive 1
4564193 we feel the one way to stand out is to give fans the most compelling match that has national impact which means that a low ranked team is unlikely to be on sunday night baseball unless they are playing a team that leads the division and to maximize ratings get the best stories we are going to go where teams that have performed for us reside the reason that the mets yankees and red sox have been on is because they perform for us as do the cubs the cardinals and recently the white sox
4564194 it is hard to anticipate something like tampa bay which has been stunning this year
4564195 but we have already had four of their games this year on monday and wednesday
4564196 ultimately it comes down to how many games behind whats going on with the wild card and lets go
4564197 i know having done this show since 1995 no one has ever said to me or a producer that we need to have these teams prominent because we are telecasting them i understand the premise of east coast bias but i dont think it applies to this program when we go into meetings we just look for the best matchups wherever they are
4564198 its all based on how teams affect one another primarily division oriented and that will dictate how the show will go
4564199 because that matchup primarily affected the al east division race there is no race against the angels the next highlight was the rays jays
4564200 if the angels had been playing the white sox that night the next game would have been a twins game
4564201 early in the season before races are fully developed we may look for a theme to group highlights such as win streaks losing streaks aces pitching fantastic finishes etc as we get deeper into the season it certainly becomes about grouping the highlights based on division or wild card race however with a full two months to go we may deviate off that plan for a night in august
4564202 we felt the brewers the day after their altercation and with prince fielder addressing the situation should be the lead highlight that the cubs game was a slugfest and the cardinals game had a walk off home run flowed nicely as a nl central grouping
4564203 it is making sure to promote the superstars of the game because of the enormous impact that fantasy leagues have now on fans we often try to make sure that the biggest names not the teams the names get their attention because these are the players people have on their fantasy teams
4564204 the way the network consciously worked favre into everything they covered is embarrassing i especially feel insulted when anchors poke fun of and question how and why this favre situation is so out of control its as if they have been instructed to act surprised by the hysteria however the glaring problem with this is espn created this hysteria
4564205 both the on air and print reporters are all too eager to jokingly acknowledge the storys extreme irrelevance and then immediately launch into further pointless speculation and content less developments the fact that it seems everyone involved in perpetuating this nonsense fully acknowledges that it is indeed nonsense is neither cute nor self aware it is sickening in its cynicism
4564206 we need a noble champion a dauntless martyr someone anyone to save us from the all brett favre all the time news cycle that threatens to engulf both the sports world and the entire physical universe one replayed clip of favre delivering a shovel pass through the snow at a time forever radiating into deep space and beyond

4564208 we bombed them for days in 1998 because saddam hussein threw out inspectors
4564209 if facts matter then it should matter that hillary clinton chose to rely on such a basic falsehood during the debate when she flatly stated we bombed them for days in 1998 because saddam hussein threw out inspectors in fact just prior to the clinton administrations several days of bombing iraq in december 1998 the u n s unscom weapons inspectors left iraq when unscom head richard butler withdrew them because the clinton administration made it clear that the u s government was about to start bombing
4564210 that false statement by hillary clinton during the debate thursday evening came as she was trying to verbally navigate what were her most difficult moments of the night about her vote for the october 2002 congressional resolution that authorized an invasion of iraq
4564211 any journalists interested in fact checking senator clintons claim that we bombed them for days in 1998 because saddam hussein threw out inspectors would be well advised to stick to relying on the original reportage of what occurred in december 1998 stephen zunes
4564212 the foreign policy agenda of the democratic front runners comparisons on some key issues
4564213 senator clinton in thursday nights debate claims that she voted to authorize war against iraq because we needed to put inspectors in however saddam hussein had by that time already agreed to a return of the weapons inspectors furthermore senator clinton voted against the levin amendment which would have granted authority to invade iraq if saddam defied subsequent u n demands instead senator clinton voted to give president bush the authority to invade iraq at the time and circumstances of his own choosing regardless of whether inspectors returned indeed unfettered inspections had been going on in iraq for months at the time the bush administration launched the invasion that senator clinton had voted to authorize

4564219 nonetheless the study showed the bill the so called welfare reform bill would move 2 6 million people including 1 1 million children into poverty
4564220 well i respect johns commitment to ending poverty thats why 35 years ago when i graduated from law school i didnt go to work for a law firm i went to work for marian wright edelman at the childrens defense fund because ending poverty particularly ending poverty for children has been the central core cause of everything that ive been doing for 35 years
4564221 nonetheless the study showed the bill would move 2 6 million people including 1 1 million children into poverty

4564248 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4564249 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4564250 youre going to have to have a huge turnout of that base again for mccain to win
4564251 ninety percent of the workforce for bush in 04 came out of that constituency
4564252 picking a ridge or a joseph lieberman would not be helpful at all
4564253 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
4564254 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
4564255 the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4564256 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out for vice president
4564257 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that
4564258 this move to a pro choice running mate such as lieberman could help reshape his message to appeal to swing voters
4564259 the right wing is not going anywhere and choice is a key issue for over 40 women who voted for hillary in the primaries
4564260 a lot of the troops here are on the fence or disappointed
4564261 with all thats gone on in georgia this will make it much easier for iran
4564262 we tested infineons 3g solution in a lab in february and it was rock solid i think its more of an implementation issue
4564263 its expensive to make a baseband solution for a single customer unless you have the scale of iphone 3g it found a baseband of
4564264 id lean more toward a theory of teething pains with new but non proprietary 3g chips and software along with what may be a newly loaded 3g network infrastructure
4564265 there are so many potential layers to these alleged performance issues that im not about to point any fingers
4564266 there are many discerning people writing about new products such as the iphone and it does have a major impact on companies brands
4564267 public relations people at major corporations tell me they now spend as much time with bloggers as they do with traditional media and they monitor the blogs
4564268 my sense is that its hard for steve jobs to acknowledge a problem
4564269 that may be arrogance my guess is that hell fix this with a software update
4564270 in consideration of chronicle how self feels over against doom by so body being the topflight time
4564271 in consideration of chronicle how self feels over against doom by so body being the topflight time
4564272 this is all a tempest in a teapot driven by a whole lot of media sources and the rnc looking to make trouble
4564273 i was on record saying i didnt think this was a good idea because i was worried about the puma party unity my ass supporters people who are indifferent to a mccain presidency and are only driven by anger which is not to criticize them that is a genuine emotion
4564274 that is reality and i thought that giving her a roll call vote would be destructive and counterproductive at the convention because it is impossible to control the way the media would cover it the most vocal obama critics would be surround by 50 television cameras and be given their 50 seconds of fame
4564275 that i had less faith then my candidate and sen obama the compromise they have just announced pulls off the exact solution that allows people to cast their votes and allows people like me to separate ourselves from the five percent of folks who werent going to support obama no matter what
4564276 the democratic voters want you to support a real winner and leader the american people want you to common sense wants you to a commitment to democratic principles wants you to please do the right thing american democrats and voters will support you for your courage and willingness to stand up to party insiders by representing the voice of the voters
4564277 i dont think hillary has pushed the obama camp hard about what she wanted in particular so i dont know what the big deal is people are looking to make something that is not here which is my view and if it is the republicans doing it that drives home the point that they are making something out of nothing
4564278 she will give a great speech at the convention her supporters will cheer for her vigorously and then obama will take it over and very few people will remember that there was ever talk of problems
4564279 in consideration of chronicle how self feels over against doom by so body being the topflight time

4564281 refugees dont have status to work they work without a permit in an informal sector have a very low salary and are unprotected by laws
4564282 there is no singular authority governing medical care for palestinians
4564283 i came here with only 1 800 the money that i have spent so far is almost 5 000
4564284 it is the hospitals responsibility to provide me with diapers but they constantly forget i really dont feel that they give us enough attention or care
4564285 the patients always complain you can never make everyone happy
4564286 there isnt any particular official authority to look after their needs and problems
4564287 palestinians have to register with unhcr and become asylum seekers to receive the protection and aid of the office
4564288 the fact that there is no official organization taking care of palestinians issues like the unhcr or the unrwa is a huge burden on us
4564289 we try to do our best but there are always shortages
4564290 some catholic relief agencies and churches help to protect them also muslim movements
4564291 you can never imagine what it feels to be a helpless motionless 30 year old man unable to get married or have children all you do is sleep on a hospital bed
4564292 you can never imagine how painful this disability is to a man

4564297 she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye

4564300 by hosting these poland is making itself a target this is 100 per cent certain it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4564301 the deployment of new missile defence facilities in europe is aimed against the russian federation
4564302 the cold war is over bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4564303 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4564304 we were screaming to the world that russia was going to do this we are looking evil directly in the eye this evil is very dangerous not only for us but for everybody
4564305 threats such as these against our eu and nato allies are completely unacceptable and unhelpful especially at the present time
4564306 georgia made a dramatic backdrop to it but the timing had nothing to do with georgia we have offered russia the right to inspect at any time it only has the capabilities we say it does which is to say nothing to do with russia
4564307 im not going to feel sorry for myself i fell at the olympics but i will be back to create beauty for the world in one way or another
4564308 from a band perspective night of joy is probably one of our favorite festivals all year because the disney people are so good to us
4564309 they are such amazing hosts and that is so important when you have your family on the road and youre sort of a prisoner of where you land when youre traveling by bus they really are good to us and were friends with the people there
4564310 other than that youre playing music at disney world whats cooler than that
4564311 the last time we played there we were right in front of cinderellas castle and it brought back memories of my childhood coming to disney world it was such a great night
4564312 its an important part of my childhood and my musical heritage so naturally there are few things that warm my heart quite like hearing four singers and a piano rev it up in my mind the only thing better than a great gospel quartet is a whole week full of them so im looking forward to the opportunity to participate in the national quartet convention with great anticipation
4564313 we are going to bring folks a little bit of everything hand clappers tear jerkers and songs that will leave a smile on their faces and joy in their hearts how else can you leave them when you are singing about jesus
4564314 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
4564315 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16 what kind of slap in the face is this
4564316 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
4564317 if its true the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
4564318 it was not easy for he is the world champion but once i levelled the score i knew i cannot lose
4564319 its not possible to assure you of the gold but i can tell you that im here to win only gold
4564320 i know things would not be easier in fact it would get even more difficult from now onwards but im here to do my job and return with the gold if luck decides the outcome i may return with the bronze but if confidence is the determining factor gold is mine
4564321 only akhil can do that he was all along confident and he proved that it was not mere wishful thinking on his part we are so proud of him the job however is not done yet even though the win would fill him with more confidence trailing 2 6 few would have come out winner but he managed that he is supremely confident and knows what he is going to do
4564322 six years three months 29 days and 15 minutes ago my husband kissed me goodbye got on his motorcycle and got hit by a drink driver on his way to work
4564323 they went to put him in a body bag and he started breathing
4564324 labor day celebrations and the beginning of the school year are a common time for driving under the influence
4564325 add alcohol to this mix and it turns an accident into a crash
4564326 i have a 12 year old and a 13 year old
4564327 have a designated driver a sober driver not just the one who is the least drunk

4564341 spicy aromas of star anise cream minerals and powdered sugar follow through to a round silky entry and a smooth off dry medium to full body with a long lingering whipped cream spice rye dough and sweet citrus fade with virtually no heat
4564342 because in my heart of hearts i think i know that its
4564343 he is an affectionate guy but he takes his work very seriously and in training he is definitely a bit harder with us
4564344 he just wants the players to be dedicated though he doesnt want people playing around during the time we are meant to be working hard
4564345 i think we have everything necessary to win the premier league again and also the champions league
4564346 we have some big games coming up one of those is on saturday at sunderland so we must not play like this again
4564347 we have the quality in our team we just need to step up now we will not play as badly as that again
4564348 we will show everyone and if we progress we have the chance to win the title
4564349 a lot of people in my neighborhood have lawn signs up
4564350 all the other countries are going to gang up on us and were going to die
4564351 if the west swallows the pill and forgives russia the georgian war the invasion of peacekeeping tanks into ukraine will just be a matter of time
4564352 i agree that under certain circumstances a russian invasion of ukraine is possible
4564353 thats why ukraine should be more serious about maintaining balanced and friendly relations with our eastern neighbor in order to avoid the risk
4564354 with fuel prices continuing to fluctuate more and more people are choosing to help their budgets and give transit a try
4564355 our service improvements including the recent addition of service in wake forest are having a positive impact

4564358 uurf i too saw that this item is essentially the plot of
4564359 not interested in any product that pushes ads to my phone a company may think its a good idea but
4564360 i would like to change my aforementioned opinion of termanology
4564361 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4564362 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
4564363 we were disappointed when reis rejected our offer the first time
4564364 frankly were puzzled that they would again turn down what we consider to be a serious and responsible offer without so much as a discussion of its merits
4564365 difficult to understand how an all cash offer that provides a 97 percent premium undervalues its business as reis management maintains
4564366 highly accretive for costar and would be viewed favorably by investors
4564367 customer care centers and service representatives are under pressure to handle the increase in inquiries while still trying to understand and resolve the customers issue on the initial contact
4564368 this can potentially increase the number of transfers and the hold times for customers with an increase in hold times providers run the risk of decreasing customer satisfaction and losing customers to other providers
4564369 the number one priority is improving customer service across all touch points including retail stores billing and customer care calls

4564372 un tempo ovviamente troppo lungo se si vuole lenergia nucleare nel prossimo ventennio
4564373 se per esempio riuscissimo a utilizzare soltanto il torio come proposto dal nobel carlo rubbia ndr al posto delluranio e del plutonio

4564384 to help me regain the taste of division d doublement
4564385 do your exercise just as a service and little by little you will arrive there i did say on one occasion that it was better to work intensely and for short moments but the intensity is in the attention the intensity of concentration and not in any shock choc your effort must be to concentrate not to wrench
4564386 sense myself see myself and that it is not my head i have the impression that i see myself as more than my head more than my body
4564387 but you cant feel yourself at all your double is incorporeal you are not able to feel it it is something which is beyond bodily
4564388 without that you could work for a thousand years and all you would receive is fixed ideas and end up a candidate to enter into a madhouse do the exercise solely as a service
4564389 perhaps you need a special physical respite how do you work on yourself when you wish to rest yourself
4564390 if you cannot sleep here but you have slept there we have a sign of work you have arranged your life a little less mechanically if it wasnt automatic then you were working
4564391 the need for an inflexible rule i would like to introduce into my life a very firm rule i sense that i would be able to maintain it i have never sensed my slavery so much as now i have without doubt had that knowledge but never have i sensed it to this degree
4564392 what you need is to relax and to occupy your thought with this exercise
4564393 among other things you changed one word in place of the word relax youve substituted the word decontract relaxation is without end while there is a limit to decontraction you can go very far with relaxation it was you who changed the word at the same time if you could understand how you did that you would understand yet better many of your subjectivities but this way you close the door to understanding this this is you i wish for you that you could understand the difference for then you could understand many things in your life which are similar to that manifestation do not forget this decontraction even a donkey can do that but relaxation only the intellect can do that may god help you with your intellect que dieu vous aide avec votre intellect
4564394 the states unemployment rate rose slightly to 4 7 percent
4564395 however this is still far below the u s rate of 5 7 percent

4564405 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4564406 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4564407 i was in high school when she hit it big
4564408 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4564409 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4564410 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4564411 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4564412 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4564413 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4564414 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4564415 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4564416 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4564417 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4564418 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4564419 i was against more drilling before i was for it
4564420 we are very excited about the fabulous pieces included in this auction most coming from maine families
4564421 i need to do this itll be a terrific way to grow my church
4564422 will these people feel thankful that i showed up or will they feel used
4564423 i think its almost exactly what we saw back in estonia

4564429 members of our armed forces traveling on official orders should not have to bear any cost whatsoever associated with that official travel
4564430 our men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and gratitude not additional unnecessary paperwork
4564431 it is a gouge but for toronto where all of our gas comes from one supply from montreal by one pipe weve basically painted ourselves into a corner
4564432 torontos energy picture is dangling by proverbial thread which is a three and half foot wide pipe that goes from montreal to toronto
4564433 our refiners have been able to pad their drop and they do not compete against each other they have the same prices in a wholesale market
4564434 there will be observes analysts and experts on what drove the price up to begin with
4564435 it appears the clearly what has been driving this price up till now has been investor demand outstripping consumer demand for fuel products
4564436 i was putting my grandchildren to bed ive already called them this morning and gave them a piece of my mind
4564437 im a republican and i will be voting democratic this year
4564438 the calls have just pushed me right over the limit

4564440 manny you right prince does have some big ol titties
4564441 anne northup said an amendment to give our children the right to pray in school was extreme
4564442 instead fletcher risks an even greater scandal with his secret legal defense fund
4564443 anne is a conservative who supports school prayer and has the votes to prove it
4564444 prevent the implementation of programs of voluntary prayer and meditation in the public schools
4564445 anne northup regardless of all her rhetoric voted against the school prayer amendment in 1998
4564446 she also voted against the law to allow concealed carry in kentucky and even once told a louisville reporter that she was not pro gun
4564447 but im not familiar with the details of that at all im sure i probably saw the letter but we get thousands and thousands of them
4564448 if anyone comes with a good project like that well do everything we can to make sure that those projects are accommodated
4564449 thats been my direction to the cabinet regardless of who it is
4564450 is requesting a hearing date before the end of october
4564451 we do not want to be presumptive in having a groundbreaking before kpabac has a chance to hold its hearing
4564452 i dont like it when counsel tells me when we are going to have our meetings
4564453 therefore it may be some time before we get clear direction from the court as to kpabacs actions in economic developments such as yours
4564454 this position on the part of mr howard has serious ramifications not only to our project but to the state at large
4564455 we do not understand a policy that would stop all work simply because of a filing of a complaint on which there has been no ruling
4564456 there is probably no connection between my letter to the governor and the conversations between finance and the bond attorneys
4564457 but if there was the governor acted correctly as the ascent project is putting kentucky on the map
4564458 our goal is to be aggressive in meeting the need and demand for our products and services throughout this country
4564459 i have very very high expectations and i think the brand will do very well in the east coast market
4564460 we are beginning to find good locations for new pancheros restaurants at the same time there is a lot of interest from the franchise community as well

4564465 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4564466 to create peace to increase the separation between the forces and to stop not the war between our armed forces and georgias but between georgian and ossetian civilians and to stop the war between bandits
4564467 we now have an increasing area of russian occupation of our territory
4564468 we remain hopeful that well see a tentative agreement this weekend
4564469 while painful these staff reductions are necessary to establish the foundation for a sustainable future
4564470 i was having a good time with friends we were standing waiting for others to go to the store when we felt a huge explosion
4564471 when i got up my legs were hurt there were wounded people all around
4564472 without exercising the right to vote patients and those who care for them lack the power to improve the health of their communities as a result patients health and the health of our democracy suffer the clinics and hospitals have a unique ability and responsibility to empower patients to participate in the democratic process

4564476 one day out of the clear blue sky he called and thats how it all started
4564477 the man can talk the talk thats for sure pretty much we handed ourselves over to him and in the end he pretty much took everything we had or caused it to be taken
4564478 he said he had to get the house appraised had to investigate and see where he could get the loans and he said i had to pay to set up the loans because he was working with someone else he needed 500 at first then he needed another 1 000 then 1 200
4564479 he said if you keep making the payments and im working on this loan for you the numbers will keep changing
4564480 these people were in trouble they were in financial straits they needed to refinance they were persuaded to go with osborn who then proceeded to loot them when they were vulnerable
4564481 many were persuaded to send payments via western union or moneygrams
4564482 no matter how much money i had i always help people out
4564483 thats just how i am everybody needs a break what i could do to help them could help them get to a point where they turn their lives around its worth it
4564484 i just thought they were axing the loans because of kims credit
4564485 he was smooth to the clients but as far as the people that done his work for him he wasnt too kind
4564486 you gotta figure hes gotta be on the up and up hes not going to be jeopardizing his reputation talking to these people or lying to you and saying he did
4564487 you fall back on the sense of well hes doing his job its just a little tougher than you thought it would be and blah blah blah
4564488 its easy to push time away with the excuse of paperwork and glitches and technicalities with all those words that everyone uses
4564489 i almost done it and i decided no thats not getting them where they want to be
4564490 so i didnt do that hindsight indicates i should have
4564491 business people realize the direct correlation between higher education and economic betterment that connection has to be nurtured and this task force assessment will be about that
4564492 in todays knowledge based economy a postsecondary education is of vital importance to the economic well being of the commonwealth
4564493 the members of this task force are leaders in their communities who understand local issues across the state given their successful track records we can expect exciting results
4564494 sometimes the business community helps fix something and then is guilty of going on to other challenges
4564495 the business community has developed a bad case of laryngitis when it comes to education in kentucky and we realize weve got to stay at these efforts from day to day and year to year
4564496 members of the task force are very strong business leaders from around the state and they will not be shy about stating their observations
4564497 my sense is they will be looking for opportunities to make mid course corrections toward achieving the goals set in 1997
4564498 the task force is beginning without any assumptions regarding money
4564499 but as they revisit the challenge of the 2020 goals theyre likely to identify financial implications to making any changes and will deal with those as business people as responsibly as possible
4564500 start with the will and if there is a strong will for education then you go about finding the capacity to fund it
4564501 you find the will first that means the governor and general assembly have got to fully understand the significance of post secondary goals for overall economic progress
4564502 mom i dont want you to worry but the cops were just here
4564503 yeah the babies got ahold of the phone and must have dialed 911 i think that the cops are leaving he said that he was going to call you
4564504 thats them now honey i gotta go love ya drat stupid phone wrong button
4564505 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4564506 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge with the addition of ryan coming on board now i think its even going to make that list even grow larger
4564507 you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it
4564508 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
4564509 hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4564510 i told tony the bottom line is im here to have fun i want to have fun with you i know he wants to have fun doing this
4564511 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful therefore some of the fun is gone with that i look forward to having fun again
4564512 i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit
4564513 i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
4564514 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was that he asked all the right questions
4564515 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about were how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4564516 it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4564517 the orbit across all angles for a more consistent view
4564518 it is not fair to take the childrens food and throw it to the dogs
4564519 yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table
4564520 i saw watchmen its fucking astounding the non disclosure agreement i signed prevents me from saying much but i can spout the following with complete joygasmic enthusiasm snyder and co have pulled it off remember that feeling of watching sin city on the big screen and being blown away by what a faithful translation of the source material it was in terms of both content and visuals triple that and youll come close to watching watchmen even alan moore might be surprised at how close the movie is to the book march cant come soon enough
4564521 isso n o vai acontecer se voc estiver indo para isso voc vai se decepcionar
4564522 i spend all day at work thinking of all these great things we can do at the weekend and well go to these amazing restaurants and shell look at the menu throw it down and say i dont like anything
4564523 i have spoken to her about it and she only gets worse ive tried to do less for her and stop doing things but then we argue all the time
4564524 well you cant be in a relationship and not say things if she love you then she should make your life easier
4564525 i did it for lisa like this is it alright

4564528 so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
4564529 i said they the tax cuts had to be accompanied by spending reductions
4564530 he did not support them because they were not balanced by spending cuts
4564531 said he has always favored lower taxes but wanted them coupled with a reduction in spending
4564532 i cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle class americans who most need tax relief
4564533 i voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate amount that went to the wealthy americans i would clearly support not extending those tax cuts in order to help address the deficit but the middle income tax credits the families the child tax credits the marriage tax credits all of those i would keep
4564534 i respectfully disagree i said the tax cuts had to be accompanied by spending reductions
4564535 im somewhat concerned that you flipped on some maverick positions
4564536 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign

4564540 we are pleased to announce a comprehensive solution for the liquidity needs of clients who purchased auction rate securities at wachovia and to resolve this matter with federal and state regulators
4564541 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4564542 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4564543 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4564544 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4564545 we want to see the entire videotape of the time neal was there
4564546 with the support of ge energy financial services as our partner we are confident in submitting a very strong bid
4564547 these projects have the potential to generate enough clean energy to meet the needs of over 300 000 homes and will position plutonic and ge energy financial services as leaders in the development of clean energy and reduction in reliance on fossil fuel generated electricity by annually offsetting over 2 2 million tonnes of co2 emissions
4564548 this bid strengthens the existing relationship between plutonic and ge energy financial services and if successful would significantly expand ges renewable energy base in the province of british columbia
4564549 very impressed by the economic development of mozambique over the last 10 to 15 years in that time you have managed to triple your gdp
4564550 crucial to discuss how mozambique can continue this development in the future especially in terms of job creation
4564551 we are very eager to promote private sector development in third world countries
4564552 its not very helpful to discuss the past i would rather discuss the future

4564558 timed to directly interfere with the impact of a political message
4564559 the conditions stayed dry all day i immediately felt comfortable with my car and i was able to push hard from the outset by choosing the soft compound pirelli tyre i knew i would have to adapt my driving style and be on my guard all the time especially where there were changes in the amount of grip available it also gave my confidence a big boost though and i made the most of that to pull out an early gap on dry asphalt its not easy to build up big leads so i was naturally pleased to see that we were 15 3 seconds clear at the end of the first loop
4564560 ive had a good feeling all day especially this afternoon and im having so much fun the speed was there this morning but on the second loop things went even better theres not much more room before i start taking big risks but i will try to keep the pressure on loeb tomorrow ive made fast times on this rally before so my pace didnt surprise me but i tried to focus on my own driving and not think about the pace of others it was slippery in the narrow sections and where the surface changed especially on the opening stage and i dont think ive ever been as sideways on asphalt as i was this morning when its dry the car feels great and i hope i can take that feeling into the second leg tomorrows stages are fast and the tests on the baumholder military land will be tricky
4564561 i gradually started to find my marks on asphalt again i made a few small adjustments to my set up between stages to try to adapt it as closely as possible to the conditions it would have been nice to have felt a little more comfortable with the soft compound tyres but i know where i lost time
4564562 im still getting used to the car and these new soft pirellis but we made some changes to the setup of the car for this afternoons stages and this seemed to work better so hopefully we can continue this into tomorrow the car was under steering a little and i was not getting things quite right on the slower hairpins the gear changes on stages 2 and 3 were a bit slow and the roads are quite dirty for me as well tomorrow i will have a big push and see if we can make up some time on the guys in front
4564563 i had a lot more confidence this afternoon with the harder springs a top five position was my target tonight i want to maintain that tomorrow because i know it will be difficult to catch the guys ahead the baumholder stages will be tough tomorrow and even though they are difficult they are enjoyable to drive i hope it stays dry because they arent quite so nice in the wet
4564564 when i am invited to overseas conventions i hear a lot of requests from anime and manga fans who want to read japanese d jinshi until now we could not present d jinshi to overseas easily because of the problems in translating and the costs of shipping books but this form of electronic comics can make that a reality

4564574 im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
4564575 ive seen magazines where plastic surgeons are saying if you want a butt like this it has to be fake
4564576 im just like dude have you ever seen an armenian girl before
4564577 reminds me of cottage cheese inside a big trash bag
4564578 she called and apologized and i accepted her apology she said she was joking i kind of laugh it off like you know ive never denied having cellulite everyones entitled to their own opinion if she thinks my butt looks like that i dont really care

4564594 you people dont deserve the projects you are getting from the state and the governor is wasting his time by visiting your community
4564595 when i became governor we promised change in just four years we charted a successful course that created new jobs saved our families money and moved kentucky in the right direction
4564596 i look forward to continuing to tell our story of results and opportunity for every citizen of the commonwealth on the kentucky wins bus tour
4564597 weve got to go out there and put smiles on our faces and do our jobs and work hard and hope things get better
4564598 public officials need to draw a clear line in the sand when it comes to use of state resources as governor i will establish clearly defined guidelines for all non merit personnel to follow from day one it should never be simply a question of whats legal the states chief executive should always make decisions based on what is right
4564599 i have gone above and beyond what the law requires i have reimbursed the state when political events coincide with official trips even though it is not required by law i expect the legislature to examine this issue and will happily comply with whatever requirements they deem appropriate
4564600 it is astonishing that ernie fletcher who ran on a promise to clean up frankfort has used your tax dollars to finance his campaign until he got caught he had no problem using your money to further his own political career the law must be clarified and strengthened to ensure that future governors cannot blur the bright line between official and campaign expenses
4564601 thats not the way this governor does business people are appointed on their merits
4564602 billys just keeping his head down working hard and watching the mud fly over
4564603 anne northup is the last person who should be preaching to anyone about ethics
4564604 in 2002 anne northup used her position on the appropriations committee to funnel 5 million dollars to a charity that she founded and was a board member this was a direct violation of congressional ethics rules
4564605 anne seemed to just will the sob out of office
4564606 republicans across the state need to know if this is the next looming scandal
4564607 the public deserves to know whether anyone that is doing business with the state that has a contract or is seeking a contract or received a commission or appointment from the state has donated to this secret legal fund
4564608 hes afraid of what it will disclose its going to look bad
4564609 anne northup is the last person who should be preaching to anyone about ethics

4564613 we do ask that you watch that speed and stay at that speed we will have officers on occasion watching school zones to make sure people are following those and those are highly enforced when we do find somebody that violates that speed limit
4564614 all the buildings around the square all the glass has been knocked out of them
4564615 pretty much called by the russians on their own they did not need to do it they have won this
4564616 this is not some kind of short term military adventure this is an occupation and not for a generation will georgia gain this territory
4564617 dozens of military vehicles and weapons abandoned by retreating georgian soldiers they left behind personal gear as well you can see a backpack and a water canteen here is a shovel one soldier even left his helmet behind
4564618 the atmosphere here on the streets of tbilisi is one of intense patriotism with speakers telling the crowd
4564619 accusing the georgian leader of starting the war even calling him a lunatic
4564620 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4564621 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4564622 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of
4564623 most of the sites are still intact and although some of the people have left in anticipation of the closure there remains a substantial number of people in those camps
4564624 it is like putting on a second skin i put one on a couple of times and it took me about half an hour to get it on without ripping it

4564630 i think jerry oconnell is hysterical have you guys seen his video on that website funny or die and i cant wait to meet niecy nash
4564631 one of the things that i find intoxicating about good filmmakers like the cohen brothers who made among other films fargo is their ability to climb inside of a certain cultural context and then speak from that place with authenticity and meaning this is exactly what i love about mark scandrettes work soul graffiti as a person who grew up in church in minnesota and has spent the last decade in the mission district of san francisco he provides a practical and prophetic look at life and faith in one of americas most progressive cities his work is a perfect collision of his grounded upper middle america upbringing and the sometimes wheels off life on the streets of san francisco he interprets life and faith as a street wise pastor struggling with people in their search for more he brings passion hope and a new language to those of us who sometimes fall a word or two short in our ability to put words to our experiences as donald miller and blue like jazz was to the average baptist youth grouped southerner soul graffiti is to everyone else only better
4564632 mark scandrettes first solo effort is really something lyrical ethereal and visceral
4564633 beautiful encounter with lived christianity mark scandrettes soul graffiti reminds me of rob bells velvet elvis what sets soul graffiti apart is the practical dimension mark uses his unique talents as a storyteller to draw us into real life experiments in following jesus in the details of life as he illustrates this way of life he manages to be both raw and elegant at the same time this book is full of ideas for pressing forward on the journey walking in new ways developing new habits finding new rhythms you will encounter an inspiring and dangerous faith full of risk taking and love
4564634 a truly remarkable work best book ive read in 2007 i savored every word on every page i bathed in this book

4564649 we no longer believe that the fairness doctrine as a matter of policy serves the public interests rather we conclude that the fairness doctrine is no longer a necessary or appropriate means by which to effectuate this interest furthermore we find that the fairness doctrine in operation actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and in degradation of the editorial prerogative of broadcast journalists

4564684 safety is our primary concern always with the development of any new treatment
4564685 they didnt explain to the parents that this was an experimental vaccine and a lot of the parents who signed consent forms were illiterate
4564686 in some cases they first gave them the vaccine and then gave them a 13 page consent form to sign that i had to read three times to understand
4564687 as far as being able to go out and do the things he wants to do hes been able to do that
4564688 thats so much better than a number on a scale
4564689 last i heard he can still ride a bike as opposed to being a week or 10 days from dying
4564690 i notice that stress eating is something i do well
4564691 whatevers in the refrigerator is what gets put in the tank
4564692 if its caught early we can reduce the number of people who would need avastin and hence lower the cost for this program
4564693 a introdu o do regime de vistos significaria que os visitantes provenientes destes pa ses precisariam solicitar um visto de seis meses antes de viajar para o reino unido
4564694 para reduzir os riscos potenciais oferecidos pelos nacionais desses pa ses ao reino unido

4564696 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4564697 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4564698 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4564699 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4564700 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4564701 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4564702 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4564703 this is for america this is for nato this is for bush
4564704 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4564705 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4564706 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4564707 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4564708 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4564709 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4564710 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4564711 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4564712 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4564713 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4564714 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4564715 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4564716 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4564717 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4564718 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4564719 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4564720 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4564721 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4564722 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4564723 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4564724 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4564725 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4564726 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4564727 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4564728 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4564729 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4564730 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4564731 you blow a kiss but it just dont feel the same
4564732 in the name of allah the indian mujahideen strike again do whatever you can within 5 minutes from now feel the terror of death
4564733 i think that weve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so no i dont believe in gay adoption
4564734 theres no reason except for the sake of red meat for his base to throw up screens in the way of children in foster care getting homes
4564735 john mccain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue he was not endorsing any federal legislation
4564736 if sen mccain came and sat down with us id tell him weve proven that both parents are important in our family
4564737 is a millionaire who is totally out of touch with reality
4564738 having complete control of a high powered os would make all of the performance demanding adobe software run rings around any other implementation if engineered correctly it would become the viable desktop alternative to both the pc and the mac
4564739 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4564740 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4564741 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4564742 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4564743 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4564744 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4564745 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4564746 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4564747 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4564748 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4564749 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4564750 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4564751 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4564752 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4564753 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4564754 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4564755 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4564756 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4564757 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4564758 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4564759 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4564760 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4564761 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4564762 the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
4564763 kijk zo snel heb je een band opgepompt daar kun je niet tegen pompen
4564764 the recent exposure of a media lie about the 12 year old palestinian boy mohammed al dura needs to be studied by the foreign media
4564765 the palestinians use media manipulation as a strategic weapon to counter israels military superiority and have been very successful in it
4564766 as we think of the death of our dear president john fitzgerald kennedy we are deeply saddened
4564767 it is comforting to remember that although john fitzgerald kennedy has lost his short life on earth he has begun a new and glorious eternal life
4564768 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4564769 i didnt find out about a lot of it until after he passed
4564770 the church reiterates its stand that the mou should be rejected by all kenyans who believe in the equality of all without discrimination of the basis of religion
4564771 who have been oppressed and discriminated against by the current and previous governments
4564772 within six months re write the constitution of kenya to recognize shariah as the only law sanctioned by the holy quran for muslim declared regions
4564773 but it was the grace of god nobody including yourself was injured or that this didnt turn into a major gun battle
4564774 there is a dangerous side to you a very dangerous side to you this could have been an ugly and very violent scene
4564775 spent most of the first week in a state of denial
4564776 one of the worst disasters in our nations history became one of the biggest disasters in bushs presidency katrina and the botched federal response to it would largely come to define bushs second term
4564777 and the perception of this catastrophe was made worse by previous decisions had made including first and foremost the failure to be open and forthright on iraq and rushing to war with inadequate planning and preparation for its aftermath
4564778 if the freedom of speech is taken away then dumb and silent we may be led like sheep to the slaughter
4564779 when we assumed the soldier we did not lay aside the citizen
4564780 history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid
4564781 we must expect reverses even defeats they are sent to teach us wisdom and prudence to call forth greater energies and to prevent our falling into greater disasters
4564782 it is the soldier not the reporter who has given us the freedom of the press it is the soldier not the poet who has given us the freedom of speech it is the soldier not the campus organizer who gives us the freedom to demonstrate it is the soldier who salutes the flag who serves beneath the flag and whose coffin is draped by the flag who allows the protester to burn the flag
4564783 plotting his interviews out like chess matches he deploys aggressive openings subtle feints artfully constructed traps and lightning offenses to crack the politicians phony veneer and reveal the genuine veneer beneath
4564784 my father was in a boys club in the 1930s in south buffalo
4564785 its an organization where you can see firsthand results you know youve changed someones life
4564786 last year we reached our 1 million fundraising goal and we absorbed the metropolitan police boys amp girls clubs
4564787 the best part is when the kids come back from college and talk about what they did they want to come home and sponsor a kid

4564795 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4564796 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4564797 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4564798 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4564799 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4564800 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4564801 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4564802 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4564803 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4564804 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4564805 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4564806 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4564807 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4564808 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4564809 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4564810 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4564811 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4564812 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4564813 i asked chairman conyers to investigate these claims because if true the administration fabricated evidence and used it to lead the country into an unprovoked war
4564814 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in the age of extremism
4564815 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4564816 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4564817 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4564818 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4564819 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4564820 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4564821 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4564822 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4564823 who are open to doing something on the production side
4564824 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4564825 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4564826 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4564839 arab racism is such that most pakistanis would prefer to work in britain than in saudi arabia for a higher income racist humiliations from shop keepers taxi drivers catering staff and so on have become a regular feature of the pilgrimage to mecca for the diverse ethnic groups of islam
4564840 they simply want to take away our heart and our soul
4564841 i think sending hezbollah to iraq is about irans desire for us to take them seriously

4564851 theres an entire generation of kids who have no idea smu used to be a good football program
4564852 people were saying we were heretics or stupid or all of the above
4564853 june knew this is the way the game should be played it gives you a chance to win on every snap
4564854 if we were recruiting a kid to hawaii who was being recruited by a pac 10 school we were probably 1 for 150 on those kids
4564855 here before i even played a football game i had 14 commitments of top high school kids for the 09 season already thats the biggest difference
4564856 i always know what is expected of me thats nothing new of course it always hurts to see the guys going out there you miss the camaraderie
4564857 i can do breaks and in cuts the consistency and endurance are still not where they have to be
4564858 the one thing i have learned is that you cant please everyone

4564879 the plans were written by a presidential administration that has been extraordinarily hostile to environmental protection
4564880 what we really have right now is a choice between managing southern california national forest lands for the benefit of recreation and nature or as the forest service has chosen for development and exploitation
4564881 these national forests are surrounded by populations of millions of people they have become last refuges for wildlife and nature and for people who want to escape the urban grind
4564882 the whole idea is we want to put a price on carbon so carbon intensive power is more expensive to produce
4564883 if we get this one wrong consumers are really going to have to hold their breath because its not going to be pretty
4564884 this untested financial scheme will put our residents at risk by jeopardizing our electric system reliability and risking rate shock while there is no guarantee that our climate will be protected
4564885 we expected more nuts and bolts on real emission reductions instead the easy way out for everybody as it has been in europe is a cap and trade system
4564886 thats not really what this is about the reason you have to mandate reductions is if you dont you dont force investors to bring technologies into place

4564915 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4564916 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4564917 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas

4564933 the overall growth in the digital media sector has been slower than analysts and management expected however the analysts continue to discuss and report on an expected migration of dollars being spent in the broadcasting media which are expected to shift toward internet based video services this is the wave of the future and onstream is at the forefront of this
4564934 we believe the accelerating shift to internet based video services will soon result in a significant improvement in the overall sectors revenues our strong competitive position including our large established customer base and the powerful comprehensive offering were creating puts onstream in a particularly strong competitive position as this market matures

4564937 maar er zijn wel veel nare dingen gebeurd zoals de aardbeving in sichuan de rellen bij de olympische fakkeltocht in het buitenland en de opstand van de tibetanen wij jonge mensen zoeken naarstig naar een manier om onze gevoelens van vaderlandsliefde te uiten
4564938 op mijn t shirts zie je een rood hart gemaakt van de chinese vlag rood is het symbool van ons land we dragen het om onze patriottische gevoelens te tonen
4564939 ik ben dit t shirt tijdens de fakkeltocht gaan dragen
4564940 wij wonen hier maar veel buitenlandse media begrijpen de waarheid niet dus ze verdraaien dingen soms zelfs met opzet
4564941 voor chinezen is het vanzelfsprekend dat tibet bij china hoort
4564942 zon beetje alle chinezen zijn ervan overtuigd dat china in tibet heel veel goeds heeft gedaan en veel ontwikkeld heeft de berichtgeving in het westen over tibet heeft het nationalisme hier duidelijk aangewakkerd juist ook bij de hoogopgeleide internetters die de websites in het engels het frans en het duits kunnen lezen
4564943 je ziet een houding ontstaan van wat we ook doen het is toch nooit goed
4564944 terwijl er meer welvaart en meer openheid is dan ooit
4564945 we zijn momenteel op de juiste weg sinds de hervormingen van 1978 zijn begonnen dat zie je in het dagelijks leven we hebben het beter we hebben geen reden om ontevreden te zijn
4564946 mijn persoonlijke omstandigheden zijn in de laatste jaren ingrijpend veranderd vroeger hadden we niet veel en kijk nu ikzelf samen met de rest van de stad ben rijker geworden en ons leven is beter we hebben geen reden voor kritiek dankzij de goede leiders hebben we nu de olympische spelen en meer welvaart ik houdd van deze regering
4564947 de studentendemonstraties van 1989 waren in de eerste plaats gericht tegen corruptie en machtsmisbruik
4564948 die corruptie tiert nu nog steeds welig maar dankzij de economische groei is de kritiek afgenomen jongeren zijn vooral bezig met hun individuele leven
4564949 als die studenten hun zin hadden gekregen zouden we het nu niet zo goed hebben en wat heb je aan een democratie als je geen prettig leven kunt leiden
4564950 wij leven in een systeem van censuur we vragen ons dus altijd af of we worden voorgelogen ik probeer altijd informatie van meerdere bronnen te krijgen buitenlandse media bijvoorbeeld
4564951 maar jullie in het zogenaamde vrije westen jullie denken nooit na of je misschien gemanipuleerd wordt
4564952 theocratie is niet meer van deze tijd een overheid kan geen christelijke moraal afdwingen maar moet juist de vrijheden van mensen beschermen
4564953 met de komst van christus is het koninkrijk aangebroken hij vestigt dat niet door politiek zoals in het oude testament maar door de verkondiging van het evangelie de overheid is geen instelling van god om een samenleving steeds beter te maken maar om die tegen het kwaad en de gevolgen van de zonde te beschermen
4564954 je moet mensen overtuigen door de verkondiging niet door wetten boetes of gevangenisstraf
4564955 het gezag van gods woord geldt voor alle mensen dus ook voor de overheid die is geroepen het goede voor burgers te zoeken gods woord is heilzaam voor h l de samenleving
4564956 maar dan moet de overheid zich maximaal met mensen bemoeien
4564957 de overheid is er niet om een christelijke moraal af te dwingen mensen moeten in vrijheid christen worden anders krijg je rijstchristenen de kerken moeten gods woord verkondigen
4564958 als ik door de bijbel te lezen het goede ken dan kan ik daar toch geen hek om zetten de overheid is k door god gegeven en ja theocratie betekent uiteindelijk wel een beperking van bepaalde vrijheden een 24 uurseconomie gaat niet samen met de heiliging van de zondag
4564959 wie bijvoorbeeld op zondag in zijn priv zwembad wil zwemmen kan dat blijven doen het gaat hier om de publieke ruimte
4564960 het is de taak van de overheid goed te doen aan alle mensen maar als ze overspel strafbaar stelt waar moet ze dan eindigen met verbieden
4564961 nee maar spieken ook niet het gaat mij erom waar houdt de overheid op
4564962 ive seen it happen to olli jokinen im just going to keep training and think im a panther until im told otherwise
4564963 the unknown shot putter once he celebrated by running a victory lap while holding a turkey leg rather than an american flag in the air he juggles fire sticks he can solve a rubiks cube in 45 seconds but he couldnt solve things on the first day of competition at the national stadium
4564964 when i started warming up it just wasnt there said hoffa who entered the competition as the reigning world champion
4564965 i guess either that extra gear or having that connection with the ball i just didnt do it
4564966 when everyone that you talk to is like hey youre the guys that are going to sweep youre the dream team that kind of stuff it kind of gets in your head a little bit hoffa said
4564967 i try very hard not to listen to it but its going to be there just being an american thrower theres always going to be that pressure
4564968 it may be a very small minor minute victory but at least i showed when the pressure is on i can at least do something hoffa said
4564969 i know that i was more than capable of getting a throw to potentially win but potential doesnt win championships
4564970 i think what you saw is just the europeans are catching up theyre very talented hoffa said
4564971 and if we dont come to play theyll be more than happy to take the championship for us
4564972 i will try to be very clear everybody has been talking and it is clear some newspapers and journalists blame me for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
4564973 since i talked with manager martin oneill in april i didnt talk with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4564974 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry
4564975 i was not doing the talks about barry i was not doing the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4564976 if you want to talk about players you have to talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football talk to me
4564977 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
4564978 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
4564979 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool thinks the price quoted is too high
4564980 it is not only a great opportunity for us to have additional practices and games from a purely basketball standpoint
4564981 but it is a great educational opportunity for our players to visit countries that they otherwise would most likely never see
4564982 temple wasnt even on the map were on the map now at temple

4565018 even if the students primary area of study is physics for example he or she should be also capable of producing the quality of biological research expected of biologists
4565019 the innovation of inbt graduate programs is the bringing together of talented students from a wide variety of backgrounds we teach each other about our fields which also requires learning our own more in depth
4565020 the students in a sense play matchmaker for researchers who might not otherwise work together this helps everyone involved produce work that uniquely advances nanobiotechnology in a way that it could not have been had these researchers been working independently

4565032 er is iets formidabels aan het gebeuren ik heb het niet over politiek of over de staat isra l maar over de terugkeer van de joden naar het land isra l god doet wat hij belooft
4565033 maar god belooft dat het volk isra l in ballingschap zal terugkeren naar het beloofde land in 1948 heeft god laten zien dat hij ezechi l 37 niet is vergeten hij komt zijn beloften absoluut na
4565034 vanaf dat jaar is god bezig de joden uit alle landen en werelddelen naar isra l terug te brengen en dat gaat nog steeds door voor het eerst wonen er nu meer joden in isra l dan daarbuiten als god zijn woord z concreet waar maakt dan is het mijn overtuiging dat dit ook voor alle andere beloften geldt
4565035 we doen wel alsof meneer gore ons hier voor het eerst op wijst maar de bijbel spreekt op een heel concrete manier over de schepping gods woord geeft al aan dat de schepping sinds de zondeval zucht in al haar delen en mensen lijden tot op het bot van hun bestaan

4565062 in whats supposed to be a gentlemans sport thats a time when you call it on yourself fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it ive spoken all week about how much ive enjoyed my olympic experience how much i love the other athletes
4565063 these guys go out and compete their hardest win fair and square lose fair and square so this is a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4565064 i still have a chance to get a bronze medal but it is a little disappointing it disappoints me a little more in my competition than the whole olympic spirit because i havent seen anything like that in these olympics we know when the ball touches us and he knew that you call it yourself because it is the right thing to do should i expect him to do that maybe not maybe i shouldnt expect people to hold themselves to high standards of sportsmanship but yes i did expect a little more in the olympics we are competing under the banner of this event to promote sportsmanship to promote goodwill amongst countries

4565086 fortunately were still more than 18 months out from the actual election theres still time for the political landscape to change dramatically for those who cant bear the thought of the h b or r j tickets perhaps now is the time to start building your refuges in the wilderness instead of just complaining about the paucity of viable conservative candidates with any chance of winning id like to think theres hope for the survival of something resembling a constitutional republic in this country but im not seeing much at this point as most of you probably know by now im serious about enabling space development and settlement as a way to escape the onrushing destruction of western civilization by the barbarians on the right and the power hungry cowards on the left but there might not be enough time the power hungry cowards on the left have already started consolidating their power and will eventually decide that efforts by private enterprise to make access to space cheap enough for anyone to go must be stopped i posted on that last fall right after the election so i wont repeat that link here if they win the white house in 08 those of us who are supporting space development and settlement might as well hang it up the chinese will be the only people willing to go and once theyre there in a big way the rest of us wont have any chance at all of going if i sound rather depressed well these discussions are depressing fortunately the election isnt going to be held tomorrow because if it were i expect hillary obama would win walking away especially against rudy or john but what im reading suggests id better get serious about my plan b encourage the sensible to start building small self sufficient communities out in the wilderness off the beaten path two years is enough time to start that project but the big question is still how many of you are going to do anything besides protest vociferously the lack of choice

4565097 there was a sense that we have got to do something the conservatives in the state had gone so far to the right that it was just out of control they believed the number one threat to colorado was gay marriage and whether they posted the ten commandments in the public schools just absurd considering even at that time the huge number of foreclosures not to mention health care
4565098 mccains going to prevail the more people see of obama in the general race they start to see him as very left wing

4565102 my own view of the troubles of the republican party is that there have been many times over the years that republicans have gotten themselves in trouble with the electorate by trying to make the jim dobsons of the world happy but it isnt possible to make jim dobson happy his occupation is not to be happy i doubt very much that dobson can control all the votes even in his own family let alone hundreds of thousands of votes

4565115 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4565116 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4565117 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4565118 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4565119 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4565123 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4565124 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4565125 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4565126 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales

4565128 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
4565129 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
4565130 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4565131 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4565132 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4565133 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4565134 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4565136 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4565137 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4565138 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4565139 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

4565143 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4565144 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4565145 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4565146 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4565147 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4565148 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4565149 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

4565153 is considering the proposal and does not have any comment with respect to the proposal at this time
4565154 then as a christian why didnt paul do more to condemn slavery
4565155 paul was not opposed to manumission if the opportunity was offered 1 cor 7 21 but studiously refrained from putting pressure on owners even when personal sentiment might have led him to do so phm 8 14 not only was there the practical reason of not laying the church open to criticism 1tim 6 1f but the point of principle that all human stations are alloted by god
4565156 in this text we begin our description of the developing human with the formation and differentiation of the male and female sex cells or gametes which will unite at fertilization
4565157 human development begins at fertilization the process during which a male gamete or sperm spermatozoon unites with a female gamete or oocyte ovum to form a single cell called a zygote this highly specialized totipotent cell marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual
4565158 it needs to be emphasized that life is continuous as is also human life so that the question when does human life begin is meaningless in terms of ontogeny although life is a continuous process fertilization which incidentally is not a moment is a critical landmark because under ordinary circumstances a new genetically distinct human organism is formed when the chromosomes of the male and female pronuclei blend in the oocyte
4565159 fertilization is the process whereby two sex cells gametes fuse together
4565160 there are many advertisers out there that would like the opportunity to understand what the sports illustrated brand is about what those offerings are that we just physically cant get to
4565161 we used to send e mails out to the sales reps in the boston area saying look were having a commemorative and youve got two days to sell into that
4565162 they could win the bid and actually get it but somebody has to talk to them
4565163 this is great now i just need to go to management and try and get the funding
4565164 when i started to hurt i pretended it wasnt this huge stage with all these people watching i visualized some of my training in north carolina running among the trees it helped

4565166 so good for her for eating the poisonous food i guess
4565167 wed like to live in that neighborhood near gimghoul castle where we run though
4565168 and behold there was a great earthquake for an angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat on it
4565169 the angels frequently attended our lord jesus at his birth in his temptation in his agony but upon the cross we find no angel attending him when his father forsook him the angels withdrew from him but now that he is resuming the glory he had before the foundation of the world now behold the angels of god worship him
4565170 and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat on it
4565171 now after the sabbath as the first day of the week began to dawn mary magdalene and the other mary came to see the tomb
4565172 now after the sabbath as the first day of the week began to dawn
4565173 when the first day of the week began to dawn
4565174 mary magdalene and the other mary came to see the tomb
4565175 where we read that among the women cured of possession by evil spirits who accompanied the lord and his disciples during their evangelistic ministry was mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had gone out
4565176 when you understand the role of women in first century jewish society whats really extraordinary is that the empty tomb story should feature women as the discoverers of the empty tomb in the first place women were on a very low rung of the social ladder in first century palestine womens testimony was regarded as so worthless that they werent even allowed to serve as legal witness in a jewish court of law in light of this its absolutely remarkable that the chief witnesses to th empty tomb are these women who were friends of jesus the fact that women are the first witnesses to the empty tomb is most plausibly explained by the reality that like it or not they were the discoverers of th empty tomb this shows that the gospel writers faithfully recorded what happened even if it was embarrassing
4565177 its a musical thing you are supposed to sing and dance along

4565180 so we have a bit of a chicken and egg problem
4565181 were looking for something that is so correct in its performance that it can be interchanged with petroleum based kerosene
4565182 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4565183 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4565184 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4565185 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4565186 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4565187 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4565188 realistically for anything to be happening at scale enough to actually impact an airlines bottom line were years away
4565189 not only put to rest the plans for the funeral but more importantly are the early innings a gradual steady improvement
4565190 motorola had been a value trap but with tangible catalysts ahead we think the shares work from current levels
4565191 i happened to see a picture of him with his ferrari in dubai
4565192 by calling a car an art piece hes making a comment on maya money
4565193 also owning a ferrari at the age of 92 was visually appealing to me in fact i can do a full series on husain
4565194 art is all about understanding molecules and building up from them till finally the whole space is filled with drama colour and balance
4565195 to gather aesthetics you just have to capture the spirit of the form
4565196 once you get involved with painting you find youre touching the secrets of nature and the grammar of aesthetics every colour has millions of tones each tone is a song in itself and if youre able to organise it you can capture good art

4565212 what difference does it make to the dead the orphans and the homeless whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty and democracy
4565213 the elites of gotham pat each other on the back because outside of the screen these characters are part of a self benefiting network bruce wayne batman ceo mayor chief of police and district attorney while the film revolves around the typical hero worshiping that charecterizes almost every super hero film particularly the fascist tinged iron man this batman reinforces the concept that society cannot be changed or made better by leaving it to orwells stolid unmoving masses it is only through the corridors of power that crime can be fought hospitals saved and general sanity be restored a perfect example of this is the scene on the ferries where prisoners on one and civilians on the other are burdened with explosives and hold the detonator to the each others ship a perfect philosophical quandary but played out by hot headed civilians too ill equipped and distraught to control their own circumstances better to let the da or batman sort this one out
4565214 bruce wayne is meant to represent the friendly and protective face of modern capitalism maybe he has some corporate codes of responsibility but maybe he has a sweatshop in gotham centre where his surveillance equipment is put to good use so hes really just an al gore type elite looking out for our best interest while making a buck on the side poor bruce if only he could see the structural cause of poverty and crime
4565215 the joker is not so much a character as he is a force of unknowable abstract evil
4565216 in an early scene when batmans alter ego bruce wayne christian bale and district attorney harvey dent aaron eckhart discuss the merits of having one strong man take responsibility for defending society against evil rachel dawes maggie gyllenhaal reminds them that when rome made that choice it resulted in a dictatorship for all his wistful temptation for roman absolutism however dent is a morally principled man who doggedly works within the legal system to put criminals behind bars so certain is he of his own moral compass that he makes a show of flipping a coin to make crucial decisions a coin which is later revealed to have two faces wayne admires dent for his principled public and fully legal stand and is himself tempted to forsake the lawless vigilantism of batman and make dent alone the public face of justice in gotham

4565220 i have never seen melted steel in a building fire
4565221 but ive seen a lot of twisted warped bent and sagging steel what happens is that the steel tries to expand at both ends but when it can no longer expand it sags and the surrounding concrete cracks
4565222 steel loses about 50 percent of its strength at 1100 f
4565223 and at 1800 it is probably at less than 10 percent
4565224 it burned for maybe 10 minutes and the towers were still standing in 10 minutes it was the rest of the stuff burning afterward that was responsible for the heat transfer that eventually brought them down

4565234 ill be horrified if god forbid my daughter runs away with a courier boy
4565235 while this incident is too sad i do feel that raising young children in this city is a 24 7 hazard there are no certainties in life
4565236 however in this increasingly materialistic age where love comes padded with a fat bank balance just why would a girl who could have any white collar executive as her date fall for a blue collar boy
4565237 there are instances when emotional sensibilities overwhelm the socially driven values

4565279 most people in puerto rico i would venture to guess they are not even aware that theres a primary going on
4565280 that additional spike may be a matter of people just not wanting to cook while discussing matters that mean a lot to them
4565281 its all a right wing plot and they all hate me
4565282 when more than 1 million students a year drop out of high school its more than a problem its a catastrophe

4565284 allow me to share with you one of my personal pet peeves this is one i encounter daily in my work as an image inspector and i call it bugs on flowers
4565285 to use the google search engine to obtain information about as a person on the world wide web
4565286 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4565287 it just looks like a costume with some fake guys thrown on top for effect
4565288 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4565289 the remains of a small gorilla or chimpanzee that may have undergone some taxidermy treatment
4565290 as a result of these orders any electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the terrorist surveillance program will now be conducted subject to the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance court

4565292 i dont think abortion is a good thing i think we ought to find some alternative to abortion and that there ought to be as few as possible
4565293 as a republican who supports a womans right to choose it is particularly an honor to be here
4565294 the government shouldnt dictate that choice by making it a crime or making it illegal
4565295 i would give my personal advice my religious and moral views i would help her with taking care of the baby but if the ultimate choice of the woman my daughter or any other woman would be that in this particular circumstance to have an abortion id support that id give my daughter the money for it
4565296 i never remember seeing him promote the issue to my knowledge
4565297 i like him a lot although he doesnt share my particular point of view on social issues
4565298 he did a super job running the city of new york and i think hed make a good president
4565299 dismiss this impeachment hearing and get on with something else because its over as far as im concerned
4565300 if every family over there was allowed to have three or four children the population would be completely unsustainable i think that right now theyre doing what they have to do
4565301 how dare you force your morality on my personal life
4565302 promises covenants and oaths which are the bonds of human societies can have no hold upon an atheist
4565303 of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity religion and morality are indispensable supports
4565304 i contend that we are both atheists i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why i dismiss yours

4565311 the fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between russia and the united states over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4565312 it can now be expected that this will be the beginning of the end of polish russian talks this agreement can be seen as a purely anti russian agreement
4565313 its making poland part of the u s defence system and in my view pushes poland along a well worn road of mistakes looking for allies afar and enemies nearby
4565314 i consider that the united states is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation
4565315 instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats that will of course not strengthen our relations
4565316 it can only be regretted that in this most difficult situation the american side is aggravating relations with russia
4565317 but when you find out who did it let us know were always looking for ideas
4565318 its nice that someone by placing a sticker on an object can make it a piece of art

4565320 but i will tell you i think this is a smart and fun piece of public art
4565321 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4565322 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4565326 this is why american muslims will support the democrats because there is an atmosphere in america that encourages those who want to withdraw from iraq it is time that the american people support those who want to take them out of this iraqi mud

4565453 it the gold is a big deal but only now nothings gonna change in the future
4565454 although i felt no pressure from the competition that the silver is not what i expected
4565455 any time you sneak in on your last throw and squeak out a medal its special i didnt win but i moved from sixth to second and thats something
4565456 i was so happy but the bronze is surely not the end

4565458 de la rosa was re insterted into the rotation when aaron cook missed thursdays start with stiffness in his lower back
4565459 when they acquired austin kearns and felipe lopez from the reds in 2006 the nationals thought they were getting two future stars but kearns has slugged below 400 since and lopez was recently released because in addition to hitting 234 he often didnt play hard

4565463 were right on track we will already come close to thetarget this year
4565464 well you know you get in school and you try to teach them this and that and the teacher has maybe limited degrees of getting the point across and somebody is wandering around theyre not paying attention
4565465 but when they see this movie theyre gonna pay attention and theyre gonna get the reality of what history was really like
4565466 toward what nasa was really known for and what this nations so proud of and thats exploration pushing the envelope of taking humans somewhere
4565467 we can send robots wherever we want and itll take a long time to get there and we dont have to bring them back but the real exciting thing that inspires young people to get into a career that this nation needs we need leading people educated in science technology engineering and math and a space program helps to do that
4565468 what attracted me to the project was this story this beautiful tiny love story in an epic setting
4565469 the opportunities there for movement are so many its a thrilling story to be able to tell and a puzzle as well
4565470 the journey of a tale of two cities i started in 2004 when we were finishing assassins and its been an amazing journey so rewarding
4565471 we had the out of town tryout in sarasota at the asolo sold that out and im so excited to be here
4565472 i had already written a really really terrible wuthering heights musical and my brother convinced me go somewhere else with that because everyones dead at the end its just depressing you need to have something positive
4565473 so i looked around for another story that would be equally romantic and epic and have all those passions that i found so intriguing as a teenager and i read a tale of two cities and i fell in love with it
4565474 so what we did there was like 30 or 40 of us we actually lifted that bus off of her and pulled her from under the bus
4565475 they text message their friends every minute of almost every day
4565476 as a concerned father of twins about to turn 17 the idea of them being new drivers and text messaging their friends frankly is a very very scary thought
4565477 i think too many people dont pay attention when theyre driving put everybody at risk and i was guilty of it myself for a long time and stopped doing it
4565478 i think its good while youre driving text message you got to be crazy got to be a real nut i mean come on
4565479 we should not be texting while were driving its too many accidents as it is
4565480 to me there were no signs no signs at all
4565481 kimberly which was just ginelis mom was a good mother she lived with me for two weeks she fed them she played with them she was a hard worker
4565482 i was shocked i was surprised i didnt know what was going on

4565486 this country will never ever surrender a piece of its territory
4565487 scrupulously respect its commitments to the accord notably the pullout of russian forces
4565488 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4565489 life is dull life is full of pain the trick is to enjoy life accepting it has no meaning whatsoever
4565490 full of loneliness and misery and suffering and unhappiness and its all over much too quickly
4565491 we are extremely excited to launch the new games and let everyone experience all of the new and fun elements that we have been able to incorporate into game play our first shipment is going straight to toys r us stores nationwide and will be on shelves in time for the holiday shopping season
4565492 each game comes ready to play right out of the box the set up is simply unfolding the board
4565493 there was only one dewey he was all that a dog should be
4565494 i will try to be very clear everybody has been talking and it is clear some newspapers and journalists blame me for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
4565495 since i talked with manager martin oneill in april i didnt talk with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
4565496 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry
4565497 i was not doing the talks about barry i was not doing the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
4565498 if you want to talk about players you have to talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football talk to me
4565499 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
4565500 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player the owners have clearly demonstrated throughout the year they are willing to back rafa in the transfer market and will continue to do so
4565501 it is obviously the selling clubs prerogative to put whatever price they want on the player but on this occasion liverpool thinks the price quoted is too high
4565502 the way well be the zogby report on the transformation of the american dreams

4565507 they went to put him in a body bag and he started breathing
4565508 labor day celebrations and the beginning of the school year are a common time for driving under the influence
4565509 add alcohol to this mix and it turns an accident into a crash
4565510 i have a 12 year old and a 13 year old
4565511 have a designated driver a sober driver not just the one who is the least drunk
4565512 within a blink of an eye you can devastate a life
4565513 treatment of advanced cancer that is meant to prolong life or change the course of this disease is not a covered benefit of the oregon health plan
4565514 i dont think any prognosticator would look at thispresident and this congress and think that they are going to come to an agreement
4565515 the banks are following the literal terms of the law andthe literal terms of the agreement
4565516 lenders haveunilateral rights to take these steps that might be unexpectedby the consumer
4565517 on our part there were no casualties just a few injuries
4565518 what was the essential message of jesus and how can we inhabit that message as a way of life
4565519 how can we be about making a life in the way of jesus

4565528 mr pomerantz was a true friend to the ui and to higher education throughout iowa his leadership his insight his advice and his generosity have been crucial to our success and our excellence for decades
4565529 marvins commitment to education and the children of iowa was remarkable

4565548 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4565549 this is a question of character as well as one of finance

4565552 selma blair elle nous montre son ventre et son joli maillot photos
4565553 he can run and he likes doing it its of his favorites things
4565554 i told him i dont care what your age is youre going to run
4565555 theres a growing conservative blogger network but the more liberal sites have higher prominence
4565556 a blogger is an absolutely necessary part of the campaign staff
4565557 im just excited and really thankful for the opportunity its go time
4565558 we did the best we could with it in regard to opportunity with our timetable with what we were trying to do up here how we were trying to compete we werent able to make it work

4565560 de las elecciones a intendente de r o cuarto para el cual el titular del poder ejecutivo saliente cdor benigno antonio rins contrat a la empresa msa
4565561 en las escuelas el proceso electoral estaba paralizado en el palacio municipal donde est bamos los fiscales peritos y la junta electoral reinaba la incertidumbre
4565562 entiendo que el sistema no verifica eso pero quisiera saber en qu mesas se da esa situaci n
4565563 con poco m s que una consulta en la base de datos deber a poder extraerse esa informaci n se me respondi que el sistema tampoco prove a esa funci n y que en alg n momento se iba a enviar a la junta electoral
4565564 la verdadera prueba de una inteligencia superior es poder conservar simult neamente en la cabeza dos ideas opuestas y seguir funcionando admitir por ejemplo que las cosas no tienen remedio y mantenerse sin embargo decidido a cambiarlas
4565565 este tipo de maniobras como las que se han sugerido directamente no pueden ser considerse porque por el nivel de riesgo ni siquiera vale la pena analizarlo
4565566 msa es una empresa que tiene altos valores ticos y no participar a nunca de acuerdos que violen la ley
4565567 huckabees campaign actually is what rudy giulianis candidacy is misdescribed as being a comprehensive apostasy against core republican beliefs

4565570 i wanted to have that eye contact i wanted to look him in the eyes for him to know i was the lady leaving messages on his machine and he was not returning them
4565571 i wanted to give him the opportunity to respond because until he has that opportunity to respond hes innocent
4565572 my children are needing physicals ive come to have their bodies examined and their eyes looked at
4565573 we look in pediatrics at developmental issues does your child have any special needs like speech or hearing well look at is their growth normal can they hear can they see cause youve got to be able to do that to see the black board and learn
4565574 we can help these kids have access to regular doctors visits and dental checkups and immunizations
4565575 there certainly is not going to be more money coming from the city we dont have it
4565576 not only dont we have money to contribute we put in an enormous amount of money
4565577 what is a subsidy is in some ways in the eye of beholder clearly the city and the state contribute a significant amount of money to the mta but over one billion dollars just seemed high to us
4565578 we have no money to do that and this is up to the state government to find other sources
4565579 he really has worked very hard in improving the overall efficiency and quality of the agencys processes by streamlining and reworking operational procedures at every level
4565580 weve got to raise the the safety standards and improve industry accountability and under his guidance we really have done a lot of things
4565581 it will be learned that pittman was present she had no part in it
4565582 and i think this is something that younger kids of this generation need to understand that you could be at a certain location and if someone else does something you could be charged with attempted murder such as my client at this point
4565583 my life is upside down and nothing can put it back together except god and i just feel angry for what happened to me
4565584 my wife just passed away three months ago and im the one who always goes outside there everyday to look for a little change an honest dollar to put bread on the table for my kids
4565585 it just makes you wonder who you can trust now i was best friends with those girls and i just hope to never go through this again
4565586 small world labs is a proven enterprise social networking provider recognized as having a unique combination of technology and community building expertise that helps customers better understand
4565587 but aretha and bob dylan and ray charles had all been at my table invited to my house to dinner there was that degree of familiarity
4565588 working with them as human beings you get to see their foibles their strengths their weaknesses
4565589 so that makes more information for them to make some decisions at the point of a disaster or trauma is going on at that particular time

4565591 infringes upon the constitutional authority of the president as commander in chief by imposing an artificial timeline to withdraw u s troops from iraq regardless of the conditions on the ground or the consequences of defeat
4565592 the legislation would hobble american commanders in the field and substantially endanger americas strategic objective of a unified federal democratic iraq that can govern defend and sustain itself and be an ally in the war on terror
4565593 it is a very dispiriting situation and i know we will have to work hard to improve it
4565594 i would immediately close guantanamo bay move all the prisoners to fort leavenworth an army base in kansas and truly expedite the judicial proceedings in their cases
4565595 i would reaffirm my commitment to address the issue of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions i know how important this is in europe in particular
4565596 a right admittedly of uncertain scope on the part of individuals to possess and use firearms in defense of themselves and their homes
4565597 people are very optimistic because they sense a development the level of sectarian violence in streets and areas has decreased
4565598 the activities of the militias have also decreased the car bombs and the homicide attacks are the only things left while other kinds of violence have decreased
4565599 this is going to take many months not weeks but the indicators are all very positive right now
4565600 a step towards a north waziristan like peace accord bajaur agency
4565601 we hope that a north waziristan like deal is also reached between the government and tribal militants led by faqir mohammad
4565602 the enemy of my enemy is also stabbing me in the back
4565603 if nominated i will not run if elected i will not serve
4565604 executive experience warmth authenticity electability the 14 year test and bonus points for incumbency or past national experience
4565605 its very clear to me that hes not running for president to advance some liberal social agenda
4565606 i am absolutely convinced that rudy will appoint the best judges out of all the candidates
4565607 there are going to be disagreements in the party but those two big themes unite us
4565608 would you expect a call from president hinckley or his successor
4565609 it would be inappropriate for church officials to contact me and it would be less than appropriate for me to take guidance from any institution other than caring first for the oath of office
4565610 mitt romney did not go back to stanford where he had enrolled and spent his freshman year prior to the start of his mission but instead transferred to brigham young university byu the churchs lighthouse educational institution where he graduated from the college of humanities in 1971 romney delivered two commencment addresses at byu one to the college of humanities and another to the entire graduating class
4565611 romney entered the joint mba jd program at harvard in the fall of 1971 and while he did well at the law school where he graduated c m laude or somewhere in the top third of his class he was a much beter harvard business school student than law student graduating from the hbs as a baker scholar a designation awarded only to the top 5 percent of each entering class of approximately five hundred students
4565612 the list of experts on the war with whom romney has met is large and growing just as his reading in the area is diverse and deep
4565613 a mormon in the white house 10 things every american should know about mitt romney
4565614 i think in part one reason that militia has been lying low is due to some of the discussions being held
4565615 its also in part due to some of the leaders leaving baghdad
4565616 this piece had a very pleasant spice that seemed to be garlic this seasoning blended very well with the cheese which also seemed to have a different texture from the other slices i believe both the cheese and the crust had a more creamy texture
4565617 flavorful cheese nuanced tomato sauce medium crust with little bubbles like nyc bagels
4565618 the cheese on palumbos had a great flavor but was slightly more greasy than mamas
4565619 i think this is more a fact that an ice cream stand is a seasonal business and we are rapidly approaching the end of the season nobodys gonna get to go ice cream in the winter but coffee could do it especially with the demise of starbucks chillie willies wasnt open last winter either
4565620 i love living in pennsylvania as well i to left the state when i gradutate from college i traveled around the us for a few years and am now back in the great state of pennsylvania
4565621 from central pa to nova sofla nyc ct and back why it pays to live here
4565622 your accusations are merely a cover for your failures in iraq
4565623 well see but in the meantime how cool is it to have palm trees right here in des moines
4565624 he was smart he was dynamic he was inspiring and he was catholic
4565625 the white house hopeful told the new hampshire democrats 100 club fund raiser here
4565626 but those who gathered here almost a half century ago knew better
4565627 they believed america was bigger than that and americans would give sen john f kennedy a fair shake and the rest as they say is history
4565628 so when people tell me a woman can never be president i say well never know unless we try
4565629 many of you are well enough off that the tax cuts may have helped you
4565630 were saying that for america to get back on track were probably going to cut that short and not give it to you were going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
4565631 mother jones conducted a review of lobbying disclosure forms and publicly available information at opensecrets org and legistorm com the records show that since the keating five scandal which by mccains own account turned the arizona senator into a crusader for reform at least 20 mccain staffers working for mccains personal senate office or for one of the committees he has chaired either came to mccains employ from a lobby shop or joined one after leaving the congressional payroll
4565632 craig holman the governmental affairs lobbyist for public citizen a consumer advocacy organization said mr scheunemanns dual role sometimes advising mr mccain as a candidate and sometimes advising private clients on their interactions with him as a senator raised potential red flags this is a serious revolving door problem a person who keeps fluctuating between being a lobbyist and advising candidates mr holman said
4565633 mr scheunemanns foreign clients arent controversial but his political and ideological relationship with sen mccain has blurred the lines between his roles as lobbyist and aide in 2000 mr scheunemann was an adviser in sen mccains unsuccessful bid for the republican nomination after sen mccain was defeated mr scheunemann started orion strategies in 2001 orion quickly signed contracts with romania and latvia worth a combined 240 000 to help them win nato admission contracts with georgia macedonia and taiwan followed like romania and latvia they are all u s allies

4565635 committee continues to examine all the financial angles of where the 82 million ended up as well as other political and charitable contributions the tribes made at abramoffs request
4565636 reiterated that he was following the money trail not the legislative actions taken by members of congress
4565637 we stop when we find out where the money went
4565638 theres strong evidence that there was significant wrongdoing but im not a judge or jury
4565639 i will not investigate members of congress because im a chairman of the indian affairs committee this was brought to our this whole thing started was brought to us attention by some disgruntled tribal council members in a small tribe in louisiana and we took it as far as we thought was our responsibility which is where the money ends up
4565640 in an interview with the washington post norquist denied that atr was used to conceal the source of funds sent to his and abramoffs old friend former christian coalition chief ralph reed and others but norquist and reed never have been called to testify under oath
4565641 the mccain campaign has long been concerned about whether conservative christian voters would fall in line this fall but last week ralph reed the first executive editor of the christian coalition and an unsuccessful 2006 candidate for georgia lieutenant governor invited well heeled folks to a very special event that means a fundraiser for mccain in downtown atlanta on august 18 reed whose campaign was torpedoed by his affiliation with disgraced lobbyist jack abramoff noted hes also agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team the atlanta journal constitution reported
4565642 when senator john mccain led a senate investigation three years ago of jack abramoff the disgraced lobbyist who later pleaded guilty to fraud charges mr
4565643 as mr mccain releases the names of hundreds of bundlers his top money collectors one person who popped up is juan carlos benitez a lawyer and lobbyist whom mr abramoff had championed for a bush administration post according to a 2006 report of the house committee on government reform mr abramoff had urged the appointment of mr benitez as special counsel for immigration related unfair employment practices he was named to the position in 2001 the committees report said mr benitezs job at the justice department gave benitez authority to conduct investigations into unfair labor practices that were issues of importance to abramoff clients for mr mccain mr benitez raised 50 000 to 100 000 according to the mccain web site
4565644 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4565645 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4565646 i am amazed appalled and highly offended by it global warming it is a scam
4565647 new jerseys tax and regulatory climate is already chasing jobs from this state left and right and these new regulations will make matters worse
4565648 rather than conforming our policies to questionable scientific theories we should be looking at the concrete economic indicators that show our states economy is in trouble and we should be taking steps to help people who are losing jobs and being forced out of their homes by this states anti economic growth agenda not making matters worse
4565649 cuya principal novedad frente a otros ordenadores fue el a adido de varios colores en la carcasa
4565650 im delighted that we will be offering this evening program again this year and especially happy to co sponsor this event with historic new england i think people will enjoy the tours and the candlelit wine and cheese reception at the tavern
4565651 im looking forward to everyone gathering at the gilman garrison and then walking down water street to the folsom tavern along the way well share some stories of early exeter and the gilman families roles in the town what a nice way to spend an early autumn evening
4565652 the gilman garrison is not open on a regular basis so this evening tour is extra special its rare for a group to gather in the evening and experience these historic spaces during the twilight hours the way many before us have done this collaboration with aim is a natural fit for us and im sure our visitors will enjoy learning about the history of exeter through the gilman garrison and the folsom tavern
4565653 he is pro choice he is pro gay marriage and anti gun thats a tough combination in a republican primary
4565654 when youre running for president there is always a but
4565655 he ceases to be a celebrity and starts to be more of a regular candidate
4565656 hard to make the argument that he was a bad mayor or bad prosecutor
4565657 when youre dating somebody you see the best qualities in them and lets face it rudys a very attractive fellow
4565658 conservatives believe that the whole spectrum of social issues begins with judges if you have a demonstrably poor record there its tough to overcome
4565659 what were seeing is that gop voters are looking for a larger set of attributes they want the picture as a whole
4565660 it all comes down to what people want from their elected officials
4565661 if its leadership competent governance and somebody you know is going to wake up every day thinking about how he can do a better job rudys your guy
4565662 it will be a cold day in hell before i vote for someone who is pro gun control
4565663 robert ellis is a frequent commentator on turkish affairs in the danish press and since 2005 also in turkish daily news however after a critical article on the akp in the los angeles times in march he was informed by tdns editor he was persona non grata

4565671 you solely you are the cause of all this misery
4565672 young man you are presented with a unique situation today where you have to make a choice see those two doors to over there
4565673 the door on the left is a certain you know this day will be your last however today you may choose the door on the right it is closed and uncertain but you have the choice
4565674 i will take the door on the left your honor
4565675 makes you glad you live here huh the only things you need deal with are boredom and acceptance the only thing a person controls these days
4565676 thats just what they want you to think harry all the shit we buy in this country pays for all that death its the capitalists doing all this shit
4565677 well i dont see you going without your damn peanuts with that beer
4565678 it still means something to know harry even if we are stuck with this system maybe the kids will improve it
4565679 you going to teach your kids to be communist now del
4565680 they wont tell me why they are here harry they just said they wanted to officially speak with mr h ganning they said they would wait till you arrived they have a remote office set up in the living room
4565681 ok sweetie why dont you go prepare some tea and coffee ill see whats going on
4565682 good evening mr ganning im under secretary of state patterson this is mr greaves to my left mr groves to my right
4565683 now mr ganning we are here today to ascertain whether your government is fully representing your wishes in the world today it is after all your government mr ganning
4565684 i wasnt really expecting a visit this evening when had this meeting been arranged
4565685 mr ganning your government has arranged this meeting at the very best possible time a time that suited the government as we happened to be working here and a time that suited your working requirements you kept us waiting with your unscheduled delay to your home however mr ganning our time will be billed via your next tax deduction we will e mail you the details
4565686 but i wasnt made aware of your visit how can i be held accountable for this mishap
4565687 your failure to show your daily routine on your remote timetable has been recorded and your accountability for this mishap cannot be contested the payment has already been deducted and the bill has been sent if you wish for this case to evaluated by a neutral party you can apply for this via your local office but the evaluation would cost more than the initial fee and youd most likely lose and be fined i would just be satisfied you got home when you did mr ganning now the first order of business we are currently at war with several countries in the middle east are you for or opposed to those occupations mr ganning let me remind you your answers could lead to your investigation as possible sympathiser or even as an active proletarian
4565688 i cant really give you an answer mr patterson cant say i know enough about the subject
4565689 well should we be in these countries or should we not
4565690 i think if we left now they would all kill each other the normal people would be preyed upon by others in the instability that would be left
4565691 but i never said i was in favour of current occupations
4565692 but you said to leave the countries would cause mass slaughter i should be aware of how you present yourself mr ganning this meeting is to ensure your government is representing you as best it can be sure you dont dissuade your government from wishing to represent you we obviously arent so brutal as to leave a country to its own demise by abandoning them
4565693 mrs ganning your husband is merely being surveyed by his government absolutely no need for concern
4565694 now mr ganning do you consider yourself a religious man
4565695 is that to say then you could be persuaded by a certain faith or idea
4565696 but your government acts in the presence and by the good grace of god does this bother you at all
4565697 so it doesnt bother you that other faiths and creeds act on behalf of you mr ganning
4565698 i dont see that there is much i can do about that if our leader wishes to use religion in his war speeches its no business of mine
4565699 but it is your business mr ganning you see your leader speaks on behalf of your government which represents you if it doesnt represent you and you are in fact letting yourself be represented dishonestly that would be a problem
4565700 could you tell me again mr patterson why am i being questioned who are you who are the men at your sides
4565701 you are being questioned to ascertain whether indeed your government is acting on behalf of you i am under secretary of state patterson the men to my left and right are mr greaves and mr groves they are my associates
4565702 now mr ganning i do have more questions but im not going to asked them i have what i need and you appear to be getting frustrated thank you for your time this evening and goodbye
4565703 mr ganning from this interview we can see that your government doesnt represent you a government that leads in excess of 250 million souls it has been decided that policy should remain unchanged and your citizenship be revoked you are viewed as a serious security threat and are to be detained until the threat you pose is established
4565704 im afraid the interview unearthed some subversive truths about your husband at this time we need the country to be united and in favour of government policy he is being arrested for all our safety mam
4565705 but you dont understand hes a working man hes never had any bad to say about the country he isnt a danger to anyone
4565706 the interview is designed to establish that and it says otherwise if youd like your husband to be re evaluated by a neutral party you can apply to do so oh it seems im due to visit you tomorrow mrs ganning i shall see you then good evening
4565707 when will you be back i had no idea where are you taking him
4565708 i was doing something i dont normally do changing the theme of the blog but it turned out that it was just after the hacker had got in
4565709 he or she was creating a web page factory within my website that probably within about 24 hours created a few thousand pages every time a search engine came in it would build a new link
4565710 it was amazing i had the site fixed within 48 hours but even a week or two after that if you did a search for some of these things my website came up as number one two three
4565711 we are seeing more and more websites becoming infected we count 16 000 new malicious web pages every day its one every five seconds and 90 of them are on legitimate sites that have been hacked
4565712 a lot of that will be the bad guys setting up blogs with malicious content but some of them will also be sites that have been hacked
4565713 as bloggers have updated to the patched version of wordpress we have seen the number of hacked blogs drop accordingly
4565714 they want to keep it running so they want to avoid being a blip on the radar
4565715 however these types of tools are overkill for most blogs my personal belief is that hosting providers should offer these services
4565716 on saturday morning i do a check of my various blogs and on monday i do it again
4565717 on the internet a lot of traffic comes through google so you want to be sure you have a good record with them
4565718 the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world
4565719 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice
4565720 this has been a really great race for us so far
4565721 its really nice to have lui in the leaders jersey it wasnt our intention to go for the stage win today but an opportunity opened up right at the end when we were covering breaks
4565722 jai 47ans et jai limpression de ne plus vivre dans le m me pays quauparavant
4565723 traiter les gens com e des bouts de viande ne me semble pas repr senter une avanc e
4565724 cent fois plus convaincant que le plus virulent des pamphlets il ma fait venir les larmes aux yeux oui vraiment bravo et courage
4565725 ne plu eblas reveni en la tempon anta interreto kaj vikipedio same kiel ne eblas reveni anta la gutemberga invento presadon
4565726 with the beginning of the school year just weeks away it is important that we do all we can to ensure that our schools are as safe as possible for students and teachers alike
4565727 it is indeed unfortunate any time violence enters the school if teachers and students fear for their own personal safety while at school our entire educational system suffers
4565728 what ive seen so far is not compelling in the least and i think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim
4565729 it just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4565730 its not on endangered species on any list that weve got
4565731 the last thing any organization wants to do is lay off employees
4565732 it was one of those things that was a really tough decision to make but the longer you wait the deeper the cuts could have been
4565733 we will be working individually with each employee to make that determination
4565734 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses
4565735 americans at base want to know that their politics is about what is right and if a majority wants to do what is wrong people just dont roll over
4565736 just that very basic principle of recognizing the humanity of blacks was huge
4565737 the entire nation is watching to see how we handle this
4565738 this is a question of character as well as one of finance
4565739 im just really disgusted with the incompetency of these officials
4565740 i am firmly convinced that bankruptcy or default would irreparably harm this county
4565741 its a nice safe utility but it has to be clean it cant have 3 2 billion in debt on it
4565742 at home workers have more free time and disposable money for recreation and vacation time than clock punchers and americans at large
4565743 which at its close makes the case for deflation and a rebuttal from steve waldman
4565744 its time to live up to our founding promise of equality by treating all our citizens with dignity and respect lets enact federal civil rights legislation to outlaw hate crimes and protect workers against discrimination based upon sexual orientation and gender identity or expression
4565745 we are ready to accomplish these goals because of the courage and persistence of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people who have been working every day to achieve equal rights the gay couple who demand equal treatment in our family laws as they raise their children the lesbian soldier who wants nothing more than to serve her country openly and honestly the transgender workers who ask for the simple dignity of being judged by the quality of their work generations of lgbt americans at once ordinary and extraordinary have made possible this moment in our history with leadership and hard work we can fulfill the promise of equality for all
4565746 jennifer reportedly shared a public romantic dinner with a mysterious tall dark and handsome gentleman at the sunset tower hotel in west hollywood on thursday night
4565747 i dont know who he is but every woman here was staring at him
4565748 hes gorgeous better looking than brad pitt and john mayer combined
4565749 i didnt think it was as bad as it was when we got it diagnosed
4565750 it has lingered far longer than i thought hes a tough kid but still not 100 percent its frustrating for him and us he wants to be out there in the worst way
4565751 ill add about 10 pounds water and muscle and all that
4565752 do exactly what the note says and no one will get hurt
4565753 una testata importante della realt cattolica ma non ha titolo per esprimere n la linea della santa sede n quella della conferenza episcopale italiana
4565754 we thank them for their dedication and contributions to the success of the sponsored by
4565755 i think its almost exactly what we saw back in estonia
4565756 o pa s possui dois grandes grupos de comunica o e ainda existem setores rurais que n o conhecem a telefonia
4565757 hoje h 423 concess es para emissoras comunit rias sendo 50 de grupos religiosos
4565758 o pa s um arquip lago com 17 502 ilhas seis mil delas habitadas com 240 milh es de pessoas que falam 300 dialetos a religiosidade tamb m diversa
4565759 prov rbios lendas mitos e at anedotas s o muito utilizados pelo povo por isso esses s o os melhores meios de comunica o cultural daquele povo
4565760 embora eles tenham pensamentos distintos os dois prenunciaram a influ ncia da cultura sobre a m dia em suas diferentes realidades
4565761 i am simply tired of these ridiculous names black women are giving their children
4565762 they put in apostrophes where none are needed they think a q is a must there was a time when shaniqua and tawanda were names you dreaded now if youre a black girl you hope you get a name as sensible as one of those
4565763 its so hard to keep coming up with something unique
4565764 hopefully we can see a lot more black children with sensible names like jake and connor
4565765 oh my god the first day of school youd be standing there sweating looking at the list of names wondering how do i pronounce qjqsha
4565766 i have a niece whos six im embarrassed to say i cant even pronounce her name
4565767 whenever i want to talk to her i just wait until she looks at me and then i wave her over
4565768 there are some people who view everything through the lens of racial stereotypes
4565769 lebrons accomplishments on the basketball court lead him to the cover of vogue magazine making him the first black man to do so given the numerous disappointing stories involving professional athletes lebrons story of success should be a focus and cause for celebration
4565770 when you have a cover that reminds people of king kong and brings those stereotypes to the front black man wanting white woman its not innocent
4565771 would we be having this discussion if lebron struck the same pose on the cover of ebony while holding model selita ebanks think about it and if we wouldnt be having the discussion what does that say about us are we only bothered by negative images of black men when the primary sole consumer of the image is white people
4565772 do you want to know what i think is the real reason behind this non controversy there are people who are and probably forever will be racially hypersensitive for either personal or professional reasons nothing that reasonable people say or do will convince them otherwise
4565773 i believe critics are using this canard of racial stereotyping as a smokescreen to hide their true disdain for any images of interracial closeness or intimacy between black men and white women
4565774 it was a calculated homicide accomplished through deceit deception and manipulation
4565775 it was done for the most venal of reasons and it was dismissed by the two participants in the most casual of ways it was a man killed by his friend and his fiance
4565776 just those facts are ones that support complicity in the event
4565777 in my mind i can find no principal distinction between the puppet who pulls the trigger and the puppeteer who pulls the strings
4565778 in my judgment ms linehan was the puppeteer who pulled the strings
4565779 i beg you from the bottom of my heart to allow me the chance to go back to my family as soon as i possibly can
4565780 there are many places beyond marrakech that people should consider putting on their agenda
4565781 americans like morocco they get a taste of the arabic world without having to go to the middle east
4565782 just ride a bicycle from rabat to essaouira and stop in basically every small town and city in between
4565783 i was walking past one day and just caught this whiff of new york pizza it was unmistakable
4565784 the american pizza is the best in the world it just needed to come to morocco
4565785 if governments make the best of the boom then medical tourism should improve the health of rich and poor alike
4565786 she is very fond of john and has thought he might be the one she finds him funny sexy and very talented plus he understands all the aspects of living in a fishbowl but in the final analysis she just got tired of his roving eye
4565787 why is it that girls almost always went for the bad boys
4565788 i watched her and i thought again the wife is standing there
4565789 and i had a visceral reaction i just dont get it why does it always have to be that way in politics what will she get out of standing there
4565790 i just want one of them hillary silda to stand on the steps of the white house the governors mansion and stamp their foot and say and another thing im keeping the house
4565791 ive been thinking about this constantly i cringed when i saw her next to him
4565792 i think he should have taken it like a man without her
4565793 she was in crisis mode she was like a mother bear protecting her cubs when crisis hits you do what you think you need to for your family later you can step back and think about protecting yourself
4565794 im reliving that moment and what it was like standing there next to jim
4565795 i wanted to embrace her and say be strong youll survive this
4565796 i did it because he was my husband i had always supported him i loved him i had a daughter i wanted her to know i was there for her father
4565797 you share children just because someone has hurt and betrayed you deeply doesnt mean you stop loving them its very complicated for any woman who finds her husband has betrayed her
4565798 this isnt a woman that he fell in love with on the other many women would find the prostitution part particularly humiliating
4565799 people are very quick to judge her but thats the deal that you make when one of you decides to give up your career so that the other can go all out for his
4565800 i think it would have been odd if she wasnt there its the pact that they made she chose to be the wife of a governor and shes done it very conscientiously and very well
4565801 you support them you dont want your kids to see you abandoning their father in his time of need
4565802 you express your support publicly then you handle the rest privately and all that
4565803 we hope that this review will add to the body of evidence that shows that enlightened father friendly policies can make a major contribution to society in the long run by producing well adjusted children and reducing major problems like crime and antisocial behavior
4565804 reduces criminal behavior among children in low income families and enhances cognitive skills like intelligence reasoning and language development
4565805 i hope that i made up for that and i hope that he feels just as as proud as i am
4565806 this lawsuit is born out of duke and durhams sustained wrongdoing and callous conduct against the players
4565807 we have not yet seen the lawsuit but if these plaintiffs have a complaint it is with mr nifong
4565808 their legal strategy attacking duke is misdirected and without merit
4565809 finally admit that say being a secretary is the best way to learn your bosss job and take it over
4565810 suppose john mccain had been joan mccain and joan mccain had got captured shot down and been a pow for eight years
4565811 i mean hello this is supposed to be a qualification to be president i dont think so
4565812 i am so grateful that she clinton hasnt been trained to kill anybody and she probably didnt even play war games as a kid its a great relief from bush in his jump suit and from kerry saluting
4565813 from george washington to jack kennedy and pt 109 we have behaved as if killing people is a qualification for ruling people
4565814 i would like very much to see him be president for eight years after hillary has been president for eight years
4565815 a majority of americans want redemption for racism for our terrible destructive racist past and so see a vote for obama as redemptive
4565816 i dont think as many want redemption for the gynocide
4565817 they would probably be less likely to acknowledge that the most likely way a pregnant woman is to die is murder from her male partner there are six million female lives lost in the world every year simply because they are female
4565818 gender is probably the most restricting force in american life
4565819 its time for feminists to say that senator obama has no monopoly on inspiration
4565820 a great deal of pressure at play for her to act like her gender and give in
4565821 its a way of reinforcing the gender roles right men are loved if they win and hillary is loved if she loses but maybe we shouldnt be so afraid of an open convention that actually decides something after all it was an open convention in new york city that gave us abraham lincoln
4565822 there is no community in the whole world that understands how to include everybody how to be serious and have a good time at the same time how to be fan
4565823 ive been training as a bodybuilder for the last two years and by now i think i must be the strongest dwarf in the world
4565824 he has never been bothered at being so small he has no inferiority complex he is the jewel of our family
4565825 the brain computer interface would use a noninvasive brain imaging technology like electroencephalography to let people communicate thoughts to each other
4565826 such a system would require extensive training for anyone using it to send and receive messages
4565827 initially communication would be based on a limited set of words or phrases that are recognized by the system it would involve more complex language and speech as the technology is developed further
4565828 we know our customers are struggling we recognize the need to ensure we help them meet their needs for their families while we continue to invest in the development of our people and protect the interest of our investors
4565829 we are about one third through the ultimate brodeo tour with behold the arctopus and mouth of the architect and i must say this is the best tour we have ever been a part of i want to thank everyone who has come out to any of these shows so far and supported this amazing tour package the turnouts have been greatly surpassing our expectations it has also been great getting to hit all the east coast towns we havent been to in a couple years thanks for not forgetting about us we are in atlanta right now about to make our way back west and then through the midwest wrapping up in chicago on september 7th there are still about 25 shows left to go so check our myspace because we are probably hitting your town somewhere on this monster of a tour we hope to see you all soon

4565831 its interesting times out there and tricky times and its very important to put something together that the fans really want
4565832 this is by no means an ozzfest but the live performance is really becoming a big part of everybodys life the fans and the bands its a healthy situation put the right package together and people will come its very important we work with promoters and keep music alive we all know about the free music downloading thats been pretty crippling to say the least it is a big worry for new bands moreso than anything else for new bands to get signed its virtually impossible because the record companies dont have the funding were better off than most because people still buy our records but for new bands younger bands their material just gets downloaded its just really really tough so how do we turn it around its going to be difficult but the main thing is we keep music alive thats what is important and thats why bands are working together promoters to try and make it all work and its looking pretty healthy this time around in north america we just wanted to put together as good a package as we can for people just for once we wanted to put a good classic line up together and have a really good tour some times weve gone out with younger bands on the bill and it hasnt been the best marriage its great to give an introduction to new bands all the festivals we are doing in europe there are tons and tons of new bands we just wanted to have a really good metal tour
4565833 e o que aconteceu e o que aconteceu e o que aconteceu
4565834 jo for de ville ikke g re noget ved det

4565837 denunciamos que la ratificaci n del prefecto de pando no ha sido por un voto consciente sino producto de una voto condicionado por el est mago y la necesidad de la gente por los miles de salarios fantasma y por la compra de consciencia malversando los recursos de todo el pueblo pandino
4565838 le decimos al pueblo pandino y boliviano que la lucha por la liberaci n es larga y sacrificada muchas luchas se vienen en el camino el pueblo finalmente vencer a os opresores en esta regi n los patriotas amaz nicos honestos vencer n a la corrupci n a la impunidad el ego smo y a los grupos de poder econ mico venceremos y construiremos una nueva sociedad solidaria libre justa y fraterna
4565839 weve never been this young most of the time we have at least three or four seniors and last year we graduated five its tough to lose those five seniors and some very good players over the last few years but jordan has been there with them and hes been playing he played in the pdl all summer with the kalamazoo outrage who did very well jordan understands his role he understands what he has to do on the field and off the field and i think hell be a great leader
4565840 well putting the right guys in the right spot staying injury free with our key guys once we have our starting group we cant afford to have guys falling in and out of injury it changes the dynamic of our play you need good chemistry and consistency with what youre doing if i have to make lineup changes because of injury or other issues thats going to hurt us but if we can get that consistency and we clean up our back line we will do well we lost three of our starting back four which is tough but you know im just going to have to do a lot more work with our backs which im looking forward to goalkeeping as well casey aubils hurt and we dont know when well get him back peter leonard is hurt with an ankle and were hoping he can help us i know he can he has the talent but hes go to be healthy so that leaves a j reed really as our only returning guy with any experience he has a lot of promise but not a lot of experience
4565841 obviously its not a hidden thing that we finished last in the mac last year but we are coming through with a completely different team this year
4565842 is a service that tries to reduce the net carbon emissions of individuals or organizations indirectly through proxies who reduce their emissions and or increase their absorption of greenhouse gases

4565864 it is a community where one native has a polar bear in the living room some have horses in their backyard and almost everyone knows the foo fighters on a first name basis stokkseyri is located on the south coast only 45 minutes from reykjav k this small village of about 500 people is renowned for its natural beauty but more impressive are the creative inhabitants living there inspired by the shore and wildlife in the surrounding area stokkseyri wasnt much of a draw for tourists a decade ago natives almost entirely depended on the fishing industry and the 26 metre high lighthouse knarrar sviti was really the only attraction for travellers times have changed the fish processing moved to nearby town orl ksh fn and with companies like kajakfer ir t fragar urinn restaurant vi fj rubor i and all kinds of museums the village is becoming a popular spot for both locals and foreigners arriving by thousands every year to take part in various activities
4565865 the idea strange as it may appear never occurred to them the indians that they were suffering for the great cause of civilization which in the natural course of things must exterminate indians
4565866 i had to lock the indian women and men together in a large room to prevent them from returning to their homes in the mountains at night large numbers deserted during the daytime
4565867 my grandfather was enslaved by sutter to help in building the fort while he was kept there sutter worked him hard and then fed him in troughs as soon as he could he escaped with his family and hid in the mountains
4565868 the indians of california make as obedient and humble slaves as the negro in the south for a mere trifle you can secure their services for life
4565869 the gold was very bad medicine it belonged to a demon who devoured all who searched for it
4565870 a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the indian race becomes extinct
4565871 we hope that the government will render such aid as will enable the citizens of the north to carry on a war of extermination until the last redskin of these tribes has been killed extermination is no longer a question of time the time has arrived the work has commenced and let the first man who says treaty or peace be regarded as a traitor
4565872 the california valley cannot grace her annals with a single indian war bordering on respectability
4565873 he was not interested in the matter of taking the children
4565874 it was an act of charity on the part of thr two to hunt up the children and then provide homes for them because their parents had been killed and the children would have perished with hunger
4565875 but it is from these mountain tribes that white settlers draw their supplies of kidnapped children educated as servants and women for purposes of labor and lust there are parties in the northern portion of the state whose sole occupation has been to steal young children and squaws and dispose of them at handsome prices to the settlers who willingly pay 50 or 60 for a young digger to cook or wait upon them or 100 for a likely young girl
4565876 the attacking party rushed upon them blowing out their brains and splitting their heads open with tomahawks little children in baskets and even babes had their heads smashed to pieces or cut open mothers and infants shared the same phenomenon many of the fugitives were chased or shot as they ran the children scarcely able to run toddled toward the squaws for protection crying with fright but were overtaken slaughtered like wild animals and thrown into piles

4565878 instead of speaking softly and wielding a big stick as teddy roosevelt recommended the american policeman has been loudly lecturing the rest of the world while waving an increasingly unimpressive baton the events of the past few days serve as a reminder that our ideological ambitions have greatly exceeded our military reach particularly in areas like the caucasus which is of only peripheral importance to the united states but is of vital interest to russia

4565903 the next 48 hours are important if he does not resign then we are ready to move the impeachment motion against him on monday
4565904 he deserves to be made to stand in the dock

4565906 complex inter ethnic issues should be solved through peaceful means through negotiations there is no military solution to these issues
4565907 unfortunately due to actions by some cis states our community has become weak and has no levers to intervene in such conflicts

4565950 there are two democratic party conventions in chicago in august of 1968 one is inside the international amphitheater with banners and placards and gavels and speeches the other is in the streets and parks of mayor richard daleys city with tear gas and rocks and mace and clubs and most of all with blood and the cloud marked vietnam hangs over both tangling them together

4566006 you look at production companies in sweden they have proprietary programming or coding or technology that enables certain things to exist but the guts of the application or the coding is something they develop in house for web or digital thats a whole other recruiting stream than what we are recruiting for

4566245 the profit reported for the quarter is the result of enumerable improvements in the operation of our marshall texas manufacturing facility our subsidiary tietek llc is the only iso 9001 certified composite tie manufacturer and the dedication of all of our employees who work diligently to produce our composite ties and support our operations
4566246 we believe that our customers are beginning to recognize the value proposition of our ties
4566247 the company has moved from the start up phase to a true operating entity

4566250 it felt good to swing it to our side a little bit
4566251 concerned to see how much top line growth is coming from low margin distribution deals out of ea partners
4566252 ea partners agreements generate two things for ea sales so it helps the top line and cash but the deals are low margin
4566253 ea is trying to get its margins up to 20 25 percent and these deals negatively impact that
4566254 these agreements make ea look more like a distributor than a developer of world class videogame titles its indicative of the fact that they are not able to develop enough of their own titles to meet their revenue and earnings goals that they need to fill in the gaps with these distribution deals
4566255 if they had their own properties say like what activision has they wouldnt need these distribution deals

4566263 i can imagine that the temptation to abuse is lower than it was in the past
4566264 theres been a series of scandals that shows that attitude is mostly naive
4566265 some of these drugs work unbelievably well to the point where you cant compete against someone if you dont take them no matter how talented you are
4566266 is like the story of the dutch boy who puts his finger in a hole in the dike but then another hole pops up

4566273 he is my brother still and i ultimately would like to seem him serve his sentence in canada for one reason the possibility of visitation is a little bit easier and just the conditions might be a bit better in canada
4566274 mostly we just try and talk to each other and try and help each other as much as we can when it comes to emotional support
4566275 we do talk to him but its quite a lengthy process when it comes to back and forth communication
4566276 were able to send emails to him but in order for him to communicate with us he writes a letter and it is scanned into the computer and the embassy forwards it to us that way
4566277 at the beginning i was really nervous because its a huge animal
4566278 he was right underneath us and i thought holy cow how are we going to kill it
4566279 we were very close to the animal actually we were touching it with the canoe when we struck at the beginning
4566280 theyre so proud of the hunters and for the community
4566281 we identified that there was a sufficient number of whales to allow three hunts in nunavut and nunavik
4566282 it was a very rapid hunt so it is very unlikely that the animal actually suffered
4566283 i still feel it im about to cry myself its not just for our community its for all of nunavik
4566284 a lot of people are amazed by seeing that animal

4566293 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
4566294 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy
4566295 it would be unusual to find an 8 year old who can play joe satriani licks
4566296 all the hyatt hotels in hawaii are progressive and work to think outside the box when it comes to the operations and comforts of not only their customers but also their employees the challenges they and all hotels face in hawaii is maintaining their trained work force by keeping them and their families healthy and able to work in a safe environment they are able to keep their work force intact this lowers costs for training and lost days and increases productivity they have achieved this by having safety training programs family health fairs hot meals a life balance program and discounted and or free stays at other hyatt properties
4566297 the lifeclinic lc500 fits into the grand hyatt program by providing the best technology available for self monitoring and as stated by the employees of the hotel in the kauai business news the lifeclinic lc500 health monitor is one of the reasons the grand hyatt kauai rocks
4566298 it is exciting to be working with disney channels the cheetah girls

4566312 newspapers and the once mighty network news organizations in this country are dead thats ded for their still loyal audience
4566313 rescue teams described ghastly scenes upon breaking through to the inner sanctums of those swaggering houses of power the air was choked with the stench of decaying yellow paper and ink which had been utilized for amoral leftist political and anti american propaganda
4566314 analyses of their demise included owners and editors long standing ingratitude of subscribers trust increased arrogance thinking readers opinions were inconsequential and finally ignoring the ominous rumble caused by the massive loss of advertising revenue buckling and caving under their slippered feet
4566315 why did such a horrible end come to be for these powerful gods of clubs and racetracks

4566418 jareds victory brings us one step closer to fulfilling americas promise of a truly representative government
4566419 when the capture took place and without knowing it the resistance foiled a more dangerous plan and a worst war scenario on lebanon on the lebanese resistance and on the people of lebanon the humiliation suffered by the zionist enemy as a result of the capturing operation made it impossible for it to absorb this switch and therefore moved up the attack which it had already prepared
4566420 the lebanese resistance is a true and natural expression of the national right of the lebanese people to liberate its territory defend its integrity face up to israeli aggression threats and designs on lebanon and liberate the remaining occupied lebanese territories
4566421 whole world will fail to return the captured soldiers back then can only return through indirect negotiations and exchange
4566422 we are witnessing the birth pangs of a new middle east
4566423 we will not be an obstacle to any decision taken by the lebanese government
4566424 is unjust and unfair because it held hezbollah responsible for starting the aggression
4566425 israel is different than all states in the fact that its presence becomes doubtful when the army loses its strength as well as the confidence of its people
4566426 the most significant sign of the israeli failure was declared by israeli prime minister ehud olmert when he said ahead of the winograd commission that the israeli army has lost confidence in its own self before losing the trust of the israeli people
4566427 the decision to go to war gained significant backing from the people
4566428 the enemy of israel was little and limited in their eyes yet the results came catastrophic
4566429 israel initiated a long war which ended without a defined military victory
4566430 a semi military organization of a few thousand men resisted for a few weeks the strongest army in the middle east which enjoyed full air superiority and size and technology advantages
4566431 this offensive did not result in military gains and was not completed
4566432 a decision was made in the night of july 12th to react to the detention with immediate and substantive military action and to set ambitious goals
4566433 a short painful and unexpected blow on hezbollah and to bring about a significant change of the reality in south lebanon with a large ground operation occupying south lebanon and cleaning it of hezbollah
4566434 the fact israel went to war before it decided which option to select and without an exit strategy all these constituted serious failures of the decision making process
4566435 the real value of the operation al redwan resides in its mere ratification
4566436 it was therefore another defeat for the zionist entity the most important thing is that the operation was achieved against israels will and reluctance
4566437 the complete trio that was responsible of this war became therefore out of power olmert as well as the then defense minister amir peretz and chief of staff dan halutz who quitted or were dismissed earlier
4566438 the july experience is still haunting the israelis they cannot forget it at least now
4566439 israel understands the high price it has to pay if it plunges itself into any other adventure in lebanon
4566440 july war overcame regional dimensions it acquired strategic dimensions and changed many equations not only concerning hezbollah in the south or the arab israeli conflict it rather went beyond the israeli role since 1948
4566441 i would not be exaggerating if i say that this war and the victories achieved through these two years changed the situation in the middle east it also revealed that a popular resistance was able to defeat a huge power like israel the victory of 2006 foiled a serious scheme aimed at fragmenting the region and drawing new maps in the framework of the us israeli new middle east project this scheme also seeks a demographic alteration in the region as well as in lebanon many local powers along with the us and israel were a key constituent in this plot and they all left black prints we wont forget in the future
4566442 in my opinion this war hasnt ended yet military operations stopped but we are still living its repercussion and we are still facing a political war in fact we are still inside the scheme and the proof is that we had to make an effort to mention the resistance in the policy statement of the new government
4566443 at the time hezbollah was achieving strategic victories some sides came with their knives behind their backs to force hezbollah to use its arms internally unfortunately for them what happened in beirut were mere skirmishes that were settled between political factions and not religious or sectarian forces
4566444 because stability in some arab countries is dependent on israeli supremacy so they offer money logistics and intelligence to strike hezbollah
4566445 regardless of the campaign of distortions hezbollah continues to spearhead the arab liberation movement against israel it became the center for arab resistance forces which still believe that the conflict revolves around achieving justice in the palestinian right of return and the liberations of the land
4566446 israel is today under the pressure of accumulated downfalls sometimes we must observe our enemy and expect more conspiracies we should be cautious from some of those around us because the conspiracy is not over yet
4566447 it is them who believe that the countdown to israels collapse starts with the moment they are defeated
4566448 at this moment hezbollah is one of parties that agrees with 1701
4566449 we have seen hunters we saw somebody moving with one weapon and he was arrested but we never met anybody else moving with weapons

4566469 i know how much each one of you is concerned about the recent rise in prices the inflation we have seen this year is basically due to external factors
4566470 the rbi is moderating the growth of money supply in the country so that inflation can be controlled
4566471 however while making these efforts we should avoid doing anything which hurts our growth
4566472 on thursday the government handed out a rs 29 000 crore bonanza in pay arrears to its nearly five million employees and analysts felt it could add to difficulties in battling inflation
4566473 all over the world and in global markets the price of food fuel and other commodities has been rising
4566474 in many developing countries the rate of inflation is double than in india

4566536 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation
4566537 the near term is still going to look pretty challenging
4566538 but as you look further out this correction in commodity prices is decreasing inflation risks which takes the interest rate risks away for investors and gives the economies and the financial system more time to heal and ultimately a stronger rebound in the economy when it comes rather than short circuiting it with inflation fears and rate hikes that risk coming out is significant
4566539 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more

4566574 we played a gig last week that was so loud my face hurt for two days afterwards
4566575 oh shit there goes our appearance on the t mobile music show with lauren laverne and that welsh twat
4566576 what must we do do not only to survive but to also begin a positive surge and how fast
4566577 the grips and gaffers seem to get a real kick out of it which helps the makeup people not so much but it really helps you get into the scene like a shot of adrenaline into the heart
4566578 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
4566579 a good portion of us were urging him to pick a pro life running mate
4566580 that choice would go a long way to solidify his credentials
4566581 wrong headed short sighted fracture the republican party and not allow us to capitalize on the democratic partys fracture right now
4566582 if he does that it makes our job 100 times harder it would dampen enthusiasm at a time when evangelicals are looking for ways to gin up enthusiasm
4566583 some people in the movement say it would be the kiss of death he heard that in the room last night
4566584 the whole idea is we want to put a price on carbon so carbon intensive power is more expensive to produce
4566585 if we get this one wrong consumers are really going to have to hold their breath because its not going to be pretty
4566586 this untested financial scheme will put our residents at risk by jeopardizing our electric system reliability and risking rate shock while there is no guarantee that our climate will be protected
4566587 we expected more nuts and bolts on real emission reductions instead the easy way out for everybody as it has been in europe is a cap and trade system
4566588 thats not really what this is about the reason you have to mandate reductions is if you dont you dont force investors to bring technologies into place
4566589 going forward we believe there are non trivial risks that inflation may continue to edge up
4566590 maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
4566591 i see these fires as part of an ecological transition
4566592 unfortunately some of our policymakers dont seem to take that message to heart
4566593 boy id like to buy that right now without setting foot in a store
4566594 we believe that women of childbearing age must have access to information that will help them choose maternity care providers and institutions that are most compatible with their own philosophies and needs we hope that the
4566595 naturally we got a lot of angry reactions some people just glared others called names we cant repeat or gave us the finger one shouted at us for minutes on end
4566596 but we also drew a lot of encouragement from people just driving by and giving us the thumbs up
4566597 ladies and gentlemen were coming out today for traditional marriage we support strong families and a strong america well take your signature we wont discriminate everyones signature is equal
4566598 they saw our rainbow signs and were shocked we were campaigning for traditional marriage in a gay district they even signed our petition
4566599 we werent surprised by the hateful responses of the leftists we encountered what did surprise us was the number and enthusiasm of those who were grateful we were there
4566600 site of annual youth pride and pets pride dc celebrations and the stepping off point for demonstrations and pride parades
4566601 most people we encountered wanted nothing to do with us they said what we were doing was shameful or gestured obscenely but to our surprise during just three hours at least 88 people signed up because they were happy to see us promote traditional values in dupont circle
4566602 more than ever before this series of torchwood will be director led and it will look absolutely amazing
4566603 ik heb voor de opleiding bedrijfscommunicatie gekozen omdat ik altijd al iets met journalistiek wilde doen
4566604 we heard a similar story quite often if a doctor retired or died or there was a merger or another practice took over the patients they patients would have difficulty getting their records back to take to another doctor
4566605 there were even stories of records being found in the rubbish bin in the doctors garage or even on the footpath
4566606 we found that all through our enquiry we would hear peoples stories and say what there were no rules or the rules would not accord with what most people would consider common sense
4566607 i think people wanted simplification and harmonisation in this area and thats what we have tried to deliver
4566608 we know the nhmrc was interested in us not making it more difficult to do research certainly i think they will be pleased with these recommendations and i think we have found a good balance between facilitating more research and respecting individuals privacy
4566609 upon request by your patient make available to another doctor a report of your findings and treatment
4566610 because i understand the issues on all sides are very critical and i understand we have a community thats split and this issue continues to create divisiveness in this community and so it needs to be resolved
4566611 they just distract us and delay us the only thing thats going to make any difference is getting independence

4566621 mr mccains name should quite simply be removed from this lawsuit immediately
4566622 it certainly looks and smells like a mccain campaign piece
4566623 on saturday night my husband said he went to bed
4566624 he told me they were in the television room watching americas most wanted after that some time after 10 p m he went back to his cubicle and was almost falling asleep he awoke to the sound of shoes stomping it startled him because at night the prisoners are supposed to take their shoes off and put flip flops on
4566625 he said he didnt have a chance to turn around and look at any of the guys attacking him at that time he just felt a blow to the back of his head the prisoners were kicking him with steel toe shoes the work boots they are issued in prison they kept kicking and kicking and they kept calling him in spanish a immigration officer saying darle darle which means give it to him they were cussing him out in spanish he couldnt fight back he was outnumbered
4566626 they kicked me in the head they kicked me all over the body im all bruised and very sore
4566627 another inmate came and got ramos and said hey dude let me help you up the other inmate walked my husband over to security
4566628 as of the time we talked this afternoon the prison still hadnt given him any medical treatment
4566629 i asked all day yesterday im in a lot of pain and i have blood coming out of my left ear
4566630 his head and his back are hurting him badly he said it was almost time for the prison doctor to go for the day and he wasnt sure when any doctor would be able to see him
4566631 as they were beating me up and kicking me they kept calling me migra migra im pretty sure they were all illegal immigrants
4566632 he is still on leave and we never issued a statement that his services would be terminated his services are still needed by the hospital
4566633 i do not want to comment on that how long he will be on leave or when he is due back
4566634 zenit have decided to reduce the asking price for andrei but exactly how much i cannot say because the negotiations were led by zenit president alexander dyukov
4566635 though there seemed to be almost as many clinton placards as there were people in the room catcalls drowned out any roars of approval from her cheering section as she began to speak
4566636 its really too early to say ill consider it later in the year
4566637 i dont think she has the fortitude actually shes really a panderer and a flatterer as she goes around the country youll see more of that
4566638 it would make it more important that that be the case
4566639 everyone has on their tuxes and you see all these people you want to work with who are cheering you on
4566640 the purpose of vaccinations in children at schools was to prevent the spread of communicable diseases theres nothing wrong with doing that kind of thing
4566641 but this is not a disease that is spread any other way other than direct sexual intercourse
4566642 that leaves 30 percent of cervical cancers which are not covered by the hpv vaccine
4566643 if you asked me about the depth chart i could give you 15 names including some true freshman
4566644 you will feel better in a couple of days buddy
4566645 you cant do a whole lot better than kara did and im proud of her but i know shes disappointed
4566646 her goal was to put everything on the line and she did that she did everything she needed to but this was an amazingly fast race
4566647 just the fact that kara is in the olympics and has overcome a lot of things is inspiring to me but i know she thinks that she can do better than what she did shes an olympic rookie but shell rebound and will have more fire for her next race
4566648 how do we stop parents who say they are home educating and are not doing so
4566649 in a long line of cases we have held that in addition to specific freedoms protected by the bill of rights the liberty specifically protected by the due process clause includes the right to direct the education and upbringing of ones children
4566650 when johnny sutton learned that aldrete davila was involved in this second bust he panicked

4566652 i have not read the classified version of the dhs investigative report

4566654 sports bars according to the league are exempt from the tv screen and cover charge restrictions
4566655 presumably the league also wouldnt object if the well lubricated guy on the stool next to you stood up at halftime to talk about how football changed his life
4566656 it was bad enough when nfl teams began holding cities hostage in demanding new stadiums now the league wants to dictate to churches the content of their own halftime shows the nfl should be sent to the end of the bench for this fumble
4566657 t he league gives the idea that its sense of fair play and responsibility is to drive crowds from family friendly church fellowship halls to the boozy confines of sports bars
4566658 well maybe that shouldnt be a surprise the beer industry does buy an awful lot of professional football commercials but the nfl would have generated a lot more goodwill for its sports if it had followed the practice of its best referees no harm no foul
4566659 how many legislators does it take to change a lightbulb act
4566660 incandescent lightbulbs were first developed almost 125 years ago and since that time they have undergone no major modifications
4566661 meanwhile they remain incredibly inefficient converting only about 5 percent of the energy they receive into light

4566672 however all that is needed to have access to pornography is for an adult to request that the filters be removed
4566673 there was an investigation report done recently in chicago and the results were extremely disturbing
4566674 they had things like 33 confirmed sex crimes committed at one library branch over a period of three years and beyond that just numerous calls to police
4566675 they dont see it as their place to question whats going to be accessed
4566676 to us it is unconscionable we take so many measures to protect children from sex offenders jessicas law keeps them from living near schools and churches yet here is a situation where offenders are mingling with kids in public libraries getting aroused and its a recipe for disaster

4566681 they are constantly firing they dont allow outsiders in they adhere strictly to islamic law they are mostly populated with former inmates who had become islamic while in prison and they carry weapons and theyre constantly exploding things on the terrain
4566682 those groups come out of jamaat ul fuqra which is a very dangerous group in its own right
4566683 and im glad to see recently that with the publicity given to islamberg that the law enforcement officials are now investigating it it needs to be investigated and closed down along with the others like it
4566684 michael i feel needs to become a muslim because i think its a great protection for him from all the things that hes been attacked with which are false
4566685 in addition the acts the partial birth abortion ban prohibition only applies to the delivery of a living fetus if the intact d amp e procedure is truly necessary in some circumstances it appears likely an injection that kills the fetus is an alternative under the act that allows the doctor to perform the procedure
4566686 i almost killed my child but you helped me do the right thing thank you
4566687 this decision marks a dramatic departure from four decades of supreme court rulings that upheld a womans right to choose and recognized the importance of womens health todays decision blatantly defies the courts recent decision in 2000 striking down a state partial birth abortion law because of its failure to provide an exception for the health of the mother as the supreme court recognized in roe v wade in 1973 this issue is complex and highly personal the rights and lives of women must be taken into account it is precisely this erosion of our constitutional rights that i warned against when i opposed the nominations of chief justice roberts and justice alito
4566688 i strongly disagree with todays supreme court ruling which dramatically departs from previous precedents safeguarding the health of pregnant women as justice ginsburg emphasized in her dissenting opinion this ruling signals an alarming willingness on the part of the conservative majority to disregard its prior rulings respecting a womans medical concerns and the very personal decisions between a doctor and patient i am extremely concerned that this ruling will embolden state legislatures to enact further measures to restrict a womans right to choose and that the conservative supreme court justices will look for other opportunities to erode roe v wade which is established federal law and a matter of equal rights for women
4566689 i could not disagree more strongly with todays supreme court decision the ban upheld by the court is an ill considered and sweeping prohibition that does not even take account for serious threats to the health of individual women this hard right turn is a stark reminder of why democrats cannot afford to lose the 2008 election too much is at stake starting with as the court made all too clear today a womans right to choose
4566690 i would only say that this isnt the only decision that makes a lot of us wish that alito werent there and oconnor were there
4566691 senator reid supported the partial birth abortion ban and supports the supreme courts decision yesterday however senator reid continues to disagree with chief justice roberts and justice alito on many issues and that is why he opposed their confirmation
4566692 the supreme court reached the correct conclusion in upholding the ban on partial birth abortion i agree with it
4566693 i would vote to preserve that option of partial birth abortion for women
4566694 this decision not only threatens womens health and the practice of medicine and the privacy of the doctor patient relationship it threatens the fundamental dignity of women
4566695 the two new justices did what they were put on the court to do strike a blow against womens fundamental right to choose abortion
4566696 well golly gee wiz can you believe were in charge now lets see if we can stay in office and not do anything to get ourselves voted out

4566700 yes this excommunication was not an arbitrary one but is allowed by canon law which says that the killing of an innocent child is incompatible with receiving communion which is receiving the body of christ they mexican church leaders did nothing new surprising or arbitrary they simply announced publicly what is contained in the law of the church which expresses our appreciation for life and that human individuality human personality is present from the first moment of life

4566820 i have never been one to believe that you will get a true deflation with a fiat currency if for no other reason than there is no reason to believe that a corrupt government long accustomed to gorging itself with massive deficit spending and obliging various corruptions both in and out of government all made possible by a fiat currency that has produced inflation in the prices of so so many things in a series of bubbles is going to one day slap itself on the forehead and say
4566821 inflation ends when the central bank is no longer able or willing to extend credit and or when consumers and businesses are no longer willing to borrow because further expansion and or speculation no longer makes any economic sense

4566863 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
4566864 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
4566865 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips this data provides a starting point for improvement
4566866 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
4566867 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
4566868 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care

4566875 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

4566878 perpetual steady well directed happy and faithful labour in accumulating and disciplining its powers as well as by its gigantic incommunicable facility in exercising them therefore literally it is no mans business whether he has genius or not work he must whatever he is but quietly and steadily the natural unforced results of such work will be always the thing that god meant him to do and will be his best no agonies or heart rendings will enable him to do it to do any better if he is a great man they will be great things if a small man small things but always if thus peacefully done good and right always if restlessly and ambitiously done false hollow and despicable
4566879 a man becomes a saint in the moral and an authority and an expert in the practical and scientific spheres by so many separate acts and hours of work if he keep faithfully busy each hour of the working day he may safely leave the final result to itself he can with perfect certainty count on waking up some fine morning to find himself one of the competent ones of his generation in whatever pursuit he may have singled out silently between all the details of his business the power of judging in all that class of matter will have built itself up as a possession that will never pass away young people should know this truth in advance the ignorance of it has probably engendered more discouragement in youths embarking on arduous careers than all other causes put together
4566880 as i look back i can see many events which apparently happened yet it seems to me now that nothing really ever happens that is our word for something which seems to come by chance but which may in reality have been a long time in preparing if one has a purpose in life or a serious intent the person and the events are somehow brought together when the time is ripe for the accomplishment of the purpose or the furthering of the intent it is only in the conscientious performance of the daily duty without undue anxiety about the future that desirable changes are brought about we bring them about ourselves we work steadily towards them and by some occult law we draw to ourselves that which we really need that of which we are deserving and for which we are prepared outward affairs in the life of a serious minded person seem to follow and correspond with inward change and growth

4566885 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4566886 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4566887 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4566888 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4566889 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4566890 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4566891 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4566892 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4566893 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4566894 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4566899 the possibility of another ice age already having started is admitted by men of first rank in the scientific world men specially qualified to speak

4566902 gaffers who claim that winters were harder when they were boys are quite right weather men have no doubt that the world at least for the time being is growing warmer

4566905 warning earths climate is changing faster than even experts expect
4566906 the north atlantic is cooling down about as fast as an ocean can cool
4566907 the cooling since 1940 has been large enough and consistent enough that it will not soon be reversed and we are unlikely to quickly regain the very extraordinary period of warmth that preceded it but the sense of the discoveries is that there is no reason why the ice age should not start in earnest in our lifetime
4566908 scientists ponder why worlds climate is changing a major cooling widely considered to be inevitable
4566909 if saudi arabia were to increase its production by 1 million barrels per day that translates to a reduction of 20 percent to 25 percent in the world price of crude oil and crude oil prices could fall by more than 25 dollar per barrel from its current level of 126 per barrel in turn that would lower the price of gasoline between 13 percent and 17 percent or by more than 62 cents off the expected summer regular grade price offering much needed relief to struggling families

4566915 if schumer continues to go public with letters raising questions about the condition of individual institutions he will cause havoc in the banking system leaking his indymac letter to the press was reckless and grossly irresponsible i dont see how he can be trusted with confidential information in the future what this incredibly stupid conduct does is put at risk the willingness of regulators to share any information with the congressional oversight committees after this youd be crazy to share information with schumer

4566952 obama isnt really one of us not in the normal way anyway no its not merely his youthful vigor or handsomeness or even inspiring rhetoric it is not fresh ideas or cool charisma or the fact that a black president will be historic and revolutionary in about a thousand different ways it is something more even bill clinton with all his effortless winking charm didnt have what obama has which is a sort of powerful luminosity a unique high vibration integrity many spiritually advanced people i know not coweringly religious mind you but deeply spiritual identify obama as a lightworker that rare kind of attuned being who has the ability to lead us not merely to new foreign policies or health care plans or whatnot but who can actually help usher in a new way of being on the planet of relating and connecting and engaging with this bizarre earthly experiment these kinds of people actually help us evolve they are philosophers and peacemakers of a very high order and they speak not just to reason or emotion but to the soul obama is going to demand that you shed your cynicism that you put down your divisions that you come out of your isolation that you move out of your comfort zones that you push yourselves to be better and that you engage barack will never allow you to go back to your lives as usual uninvolved uninformed

4567030 dna results reveal that the creature known as bigfoot evolved from modern man
4567031 if you think about it it makes sense we are not well adapted to our environment and cannot survive cold weather without the aid of clothing and heated shelter we suck bigfoot rules deal with it
4567032 at the rate the bigfoot creatures are advancing they may develop bulletproof skin and then wed be screwed because our firearms would be ineffective that would then leave only nuclear weapons for our defense and that might cause them to mutate into an even more highly evolved life form and bigfoot regime change wont work because we dont know which one of them is in charge so we must negotiate
4567033 i would just like people to understand that the veil doesnt act as a barrier
4567034 i read about aishah azmi before putting on a niqab she seems to have upset people because she wasnt willing to respect her employers way of doing things its not fair to expect children to understand why their helper wants to hide her face from them i immediately feel claustrophobic as the veil covers my nose and mouth i can hardly breathe when i do take a breath the material is sucked into my mouth and nostrils and i feel as if i am forced to breathe in stale air i feel more exposed wearing a niqab and am definitely attracting more attention than if i had stepped out naked
4567035 theres a reason some of john mccains conservative supporters avoid discussing his record

4567043 my coach told me to run the first two laps with my head and the rest with my heart and thats exactly what i did
4567044 i felt the nerves this afternoon but as soon as i was on the track i knew it was fine i really felt good out there but it could be very fast in the semi finals
4567045 its just lekker to be here the olympic games 80 000 people how can you not enjoy it
4567046 the biggest mistake i made last year was to run off his jacksons pace i sort of glanced at him at hurdle three and then focused on my own race its going to take a low 48 perhaps 48 45 to make the finals
4567047 i knew i had one of the tough heats and knew i couldnt breeze through it so over the last hurdle i went for a place im glad its over and weve broken the ice now im looking forward to the semi
4567048 im feeling good but the semis are tough almost as tough as the final at least mentally
4567049 i look at the times in the heat and considering the previous olympic games these are going to be really fast races
4567050 i just wanted to go through the main thing now is the semi final and from there the final im very happy of course i wanted to win but second place was enough im trying to hold the big rockets for the final
4567051 we need to keep focus and not make any mistakes in the races thats all it boils down to

4567075 the ruling to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the al aqsa mosque and the holy mosque from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim
4567076 and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together
4567077 fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression and there prevail justice and faith in god
4567078 theres nothing were doing that wasnt already on the books
4567079 they know if they come to del rio they are going home they are going to jail
4567080 if it expands in one area guess what it still comes in from another area
4567081 its a way of criminalizing someone who just wants to come here and work
4567082 the suicide bombers go through stages and the most important stage is not when they blow themselves up the most important stage is conforming them to the muslim ideology once they are conformed to the ideology the rest is easy that is the role i had
4567083 theres not a single verse in the koran talking about peace with a non muslim with the jews and the christians islam means submission islam means surrender it means you surrender and accept islamic hegemony over yourselves
4567084 it cannot be combated simply by force it needs to be combated ideologically spiritually as well as through arms
4567085 from the beginning mohammed used the mosque to propagate this ideology it was in the mosque that jihad was declared and that troops were sent to conquer the rest of the world the mosque was the seat of government and americans are right to be concerned about their growth
4567086 because of the koranic text and what it says it incites violence
4567087 slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush
4567088 this kind of tactic of taking verses out of context can be used against any religious faith
4567089 it can and has been used against the bible and has been used against the quran
4567090 these verses deal with the real experience of the muslim community at the time when they were under attack its not a general injunction to go out and harm people the only people who take it that way are those who want to promote hostility toward islam and muslims they would object if the same thing were done to their faith
4567091 no thats far from the truth theres nothing in the koran no verse that im aware of that advocates the killing of nonbelievers
4567092 that this is not what the text means and that these texts are no longer effective they have passed their date but if they remain effective and eternally valid then in america we have a serious problem
4567093 they are infiltrating and undermining every part of this society we are promoting islamic mortgages islamic insurance companies there are 29 banks in the united states promoting islamic banking since 1999 dow jones has launched dow jones islamic index and has subjected itself to be governed by an international sharia board
4567094 the islamic organizations have their missionaries and there are active or sleeping cells in this country
4567095 a pakistani organization that is hand in glove with the wahaabis strong muslim sects known for their strict observance of the koran and a strong facilitator of al qaida and other factions of terrorism they alone have 1 000 missionaries in new york 50 000 across the united states this is only one organization in 1994 i took a map and started putting pins in it i found there is not a single state without a mosque since then the number has increased
4567096 the president informed me that syria supports the security council resolution 1701 and will help in its implementation
4567097 while stating syrian objections to the presence of foreign forces along the syrian lebanese border the president committed to me that syria will take all necessary measures to implement in full paragraph 15 of the resolution
4567098 no arms are being smuggled to the resistance hizbollah from syria
4567099 there must be a way to verify now if this would be solved and i think the secretary general of the un is looking for ways and means to assure it then israel will believe it

4567102 malak is receiving the penalty of death for having committed adultery which under the sharia legal system includes any type of intimate relationship between a girl woman and a man to whom she is not permanently or temporarily married such a relationship does not necessarily mean a sexual relationship further charges of adultery are routinely issued to women girls who have been raped and they are sentenced to death
4567103 after she was arrested they obtained a forced confession from her stating that she had been involved in an extramarital affair with the man who had murdered her husband
4567104 we are glad to inform you that we have heard that ayatollah shahroudi has acted to stop the execution of ashraf the 37 year old mother of four who was sentenced to stoning for having had extramarital sex however her fate is not yet clear and we urge you to continue writing to the iranian authorities on her behalf
4567105 i am asking you to please continue your efforts and keep your voices loud until we make sure that kolhari is safe
4567106 the islamic regime has been known to say one thing and do exactly the opposite
4567107 it is still quite possible that the islamic regime will schedule a rush sham trial and re issue the same sentence before we have a chance to take the appropriate legal actions it is also possible that even with a new trial ghorbany would still receive the same sentence or be sentenced to death by public hanging instead
4567108 no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment
4567109 to have legal assistance assigned to the accused in any case where the interests of justice so require
4567110 the accused women have received no legal representation and because under the sharia legal system their testimony is at best worth only half the value of the testimony of men their so called trials last only a few minutes after which they are immediately sentenced
4567111 there are no scheduled dates for such killings in iran
4567112 a prisoner can be executed at any time with little or no notice at all needless to say that makes matters that much more complicated and urgent in these types of cases
4567113 let us all express our outrage to prevent these barbaric executions
4567114 let us all of us take steps to ensure that no innocent woman will ever feel a rope around her neck or any stones launched at her helpless body by the hands of her own peers
4567115 i am not guilty of a crime i have only committed an act that is the natural right of every human
4567116 people are more aware of signs of a heart attack and rush to a hospital even if they have a minor chest pain but for brain stroke the initial symptoms are often missed or misinterpreted as weakness however tia symptoms should be taken seriously as they are markers of an impending brain stroke
4567117 in a survey conducted three decades ago the incidence was 39 79 per 100 000 population but recent studies show that the prevalence is nearly 250 300 per 100 000 population in some pockets of india it is as high as 800 900 per 100 000 population
4567118 till two decades ago strokes were more common among older people
4567119 because of high blood pressure the arteries sometimes rupture causing bleeding in the brain stress also indirectly contributes to a stroke as it raises the chances of other medical conditions like high blood pressure
4567120 a person can be paralysed or suffer vision or speech loss depending on which part of the brain has been affected the window period for reversing the damage provided the patient has been taken care of in the initial few minutes is three hours in case of brain stroke
4567121 i hadnt said a word to her or touched her
4567122 i assume they think the kids were very natural looking and nice
4567123 fifty six children from 56 chinese ethnic groups cluster around the chinese national flag representing the 56 ethnic groups
4567124 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance
4567125 so altogether they had to stay there for six to seven hours and they could not even go to the toilet so they all wore nappies
4567126 i really miss the days when tv used to go off
4567127 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4567128 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4567129 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4567130 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4567131 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4567132 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4567133 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4567134 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4567135 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4567136 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4567137 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4567138 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4567139 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4567140 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4567141 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4567142 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4567143 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4567144 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4567145 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4567146 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4567147 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police

4567159 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
4567160 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
4567161 one of the things that surprised me because i grew up in england was that people here northern ireland protestants and i only learned this fairly recently protestants would have been taught as children that they could not trust catholics i found that astonishing but when i explored it with protestant friends they all agreed that was the case
4567162 i could never understand why it mattered that i was a catholic police ombudsman it baffled me but eventually i was told this was the teaching of some churches to their people and that meant i could understand a lot of what has been said about me
4567163 ryanair planned to clamp down on screenscraping websites that he says are ripping customers off by adding
4567164 the battle against prince nuada which is to lead to co antrim in northern ireland
4567165 it appears to be more difficult for a north of irelander to allow an honest difference of opinion in an opponent so that he is apt to regard the terms opponent and enemy as synonymous
4567166 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4567167 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4567168 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4567169 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4567170 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4567171 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4567172 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4567173 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4567174 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4567175 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4567176 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4567177 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4567178 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4567179 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police

4567195 this site is not meant to make anyone feel uncomfortable
4567196 we are examining all our costs very carefully to see what reductions can be achieved since fuel is the single biggest cost reducing fuel burn is the biggest focus then further streamlining operations by looking if there is some city that we can discontinue flying to and faster turnarounds are the other priority areas but costs can t be pruned beyond a point so revenue side will get as much attention
4567197 runaway train never going back wrong way on a one way track seems like i should be getting somewhere somehow im neither here nor there

4567252 about two years ago i watched mary kate smoke a marijuana joint and pass it on to friends when they were all at a party together
4567253 then there were her friends who definitely did drugs i especially remember three hangers on two guys and a girl i would call them drug dealers

4567257 even in high school she liked to drink vodka with fruit juice or mixer mary kate would get so blasted that her sister ashley would pull her aside and tell her to stop
4567258 when she was 16 her weight dropped below 80 pounds i remember ashley telling me at the time mary kate just wont eat my family is going nuts we didnt know what to do so we put her in the hospital

4567338 why has government been instituted at all because the passions
4567339 if from the more wretched parts of the old world we look at those which are in an advanced stage of improvement we still find the greedy hand of government thrusting itself into every corner and crevice of industry and grasping the spoil of the multitude invention is continually exercised to furnish new pretenses for revenues and taxation it watches prosperity as its prey and permits none to escape without tribute
4567340 the spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to create whatever the form of government a real despotism a just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position
4567341 the care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government
4567342 the object and practice of liberty lies in the limitations of government
4567343 the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time the hand of force may destroy but cannot disjoin them
4567344 we demand entire freedom of action and then expect the government in some miraculous ways to save us from the consequences of our own acts self government means self reliance

4567369 the short answer is his people are indeed from ulster from county antrim ireland they left from coleraine town circa 1719 and appear on the border of the pennsylvania and maryland colony in the early 1720s his immigrant ancestor was named alexander mckean and yes the two lads who run the ulster heritage dna project are from the same mccain family
4567370 the conservative party has no issue with the orange order it is a perfectly legal organisation and many of its members are engaged in charity and church work
4567371 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4567372 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4567373 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4567374 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4567375 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4567376 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4567377 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4567378 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4567379 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4567380 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4567381 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4567382 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
4567383 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
4567384 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4567385 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
4567386 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
4567387 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
4567388 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
4567389 the bloodiest month for american soldiers since the invasion of iraq
4567390 what did he know and when did he know it
4567391 if i win this i will probably rethink and play in the netherlands next week and try to qualify
4567392 its farfetched to think that ill get a wild card
4567393 the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it does not matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4567394 its never fun to miss the cut especially not at home
4567395 its fortunate that we dont play here all year around
4567396 at all times sincere friends of freedom have been rare and its triumphs have been due to minorities
4567397 help me oh god why does this man torture me so gaaah
4567398 who could resist a show filled with shipwrecks whorehouses pirates incest and floating coffins all that and a happy ending
4567399 who would fare better in this world of fitful time those who have seen the future and live only one life or those who have not seen the future and wait to live life or those who deny the future and live two lives
4567400 property is not the sacred right when a rich man becomes poor it is a misfortune it is not a moral evil when a poor man becomes destitute it is a moral evil teeming with consequences and injurious to society and morality
4567401 if most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes and shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas and shoddy philosophies it would be a sad situation if the wrapper were better than the meat wrapped inside it
4567402 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source if gasoline prices fall alternative fuels and the cost to convert fleets over to them become less and less attractive
4567403 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
4567404 which means the publisher went under and theres nobody to fight for copyright its not freeware just abandoned and so pretty much the same thing as freeware
4567405 we repeatedly asked gregory are the parents going to be there this is a birthday party are you sure the parents are holding it yeah you guys worry too much he was right he never lied to us about that kind of stuff
4567406 cuil launched in a blaze of glory and went down in a ball of flames
4567407 vinieron a contarnos los proyectos que hay para la ciudad y que se integran a toda esta movida de inversiones en el sector comercial que estamos viviendo
4567408 para nosotros es una satisfacci n porque se trata de una nueva inversi n importante para la ciudad y tambi n la ratificaci n de un espacio comercial que ya est instalado con otros fines pero con un movimiento importante
4567409 nos queda solucionar siete casos puntuales que son locales chicos sin empleados atendidos por sus due os y que tienen contratos vencidos no es que no se est respetando alguna situaci n contractual
4567410 cerca del 89 de los docentes que votaron se expresaron y definieron un plan de lucha por 48 y 72 horas con evaluaci n de la propuesta que realice el gobierno tambi n se desarrollar n acciones locales como movilizaciones en departamentales
4567411 los docentes estamos en una situaci n muy compleja con respecto al tema salarial los maestros est n convencidos de que hemos hecho un gran esfuerzo para estar un mes en la mesa de discusi n y que tendr a que haber habido una propuesta en esa mesa si se quiere jerarquizar el di logo
4567412 i have heard from several people that they saw the cyclists around town this weekend shopping and eating at restaurants
4567413 we were busy all day there was a steady stream of people
4567414 last weekends bikes blues and bayous was an extremely successful event in attracting tourists to greenwood especially for its first year we cant wait to see what the turnout will be for next year greenwood needs more events like this one
4567415 it was a terrific first time event i have no complaints and heard few complaints from other cyclists
4567416 we dont necessarily know all the impacts but we know enough to know that they are being catastrophic
4567417 the ecological balance of the great lakes is at a tipping point and the question is can they recover or can we act quickly enough to help them recover
4567418 no more farc we dont want any more farc young people have to say no to the farc and tell them to stop their violence
4567419 i think this march will set a precedent in colombia because for the first time all colombians are going to protest as one body
4567420 we condemn this manipulation its propaganda which while pretending to be against the farc is completely organised by the government
4567421 were very short of time now if were going to relocate now it needs to be made within the next few days operationally it would be difficult but its certainly not an option that would be discarded and it could be relocated
4567422 ca needs to give us a firm commitment all theyve done is to listen to the facts we know that there are still some concerns particularly from the players association mainly on the actual implementation of the security measures which are in place
4567423 be honest would you have stayed up until 1 00am watching mens gymnastics had it not been in hd
4567424 my daughter whos a doctor in salt lake city she captained one of the fantasy teams and then was thrown out of the league because of inside information but i will say she was clean
4567425 she did not phone me about it and she was very upset about it but she knows football as all my girls do
4567426 fda is the government agency we rely upon to assess food contact products theyve assessed this issue in great detail and their conclusion is very reassuring
4567427 its ironic fda would choose to ignore dozens of studies funded by the national institutes of health this countrys best scientists and instead rely on flawed studies from industry
4567428 its clear mr kilpatrick knew who detective white was he specifically called him by name
4567429 his purpose for going out there is subject to question
4567430 he grabbed me with both hands around my shoulders and he threw me he threw me into investigator kinney
4567431 when they get to his house they know its not his house
4567432 at that point its over there is no interference with a government officer
4567433 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this

4567444 its tough not to see all of the publicity all the other things all around but overall i think we have done a great job of ignoring the hype and executing all of the things we have to do
4567445 hes smart a really heady player hes not the biggest or the strongest but he can just play football with his attitude and the toughness he plays with it just helps the defense out more
4567446 theyve definitely got me working im switching between defensive line and linebacker
4567447 there are some techniques i need to work on at defensive end dealing with cut blocks and getting around the horn with linebacker i still have to work on my get offs hitting the holes and dropping into pass coverage
4567448 its pretty much the same but i actually have more freedom coming off the edge im really enjoying it
4567449 they have been training hard and working out a lot were hoping to get them back soon
4567450 rey has shown me a lot of stuff when i make a mistake hell walk me through it and guide me hes been a great guy to play under

4567456 he has indicated he is not a rich man and cant live abroad
4567457 we hope that in the interest of the good of pakistan and for the good of the country that mr musharraf takes the right course and resigns before the impeachment process begins
4567458 official action has to be taken by him and he has not yet taken the action
4567459 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4567460 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4567461 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4567462 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4567463 its a fabulous market for trader types that play off all this volatility but long term investors are still scared
4567464 the authorities in harare should not be represented at the political level at any sadc summit as that would be equal to giving them legitimacy
4567465 i never loved a man the way i love you
4567466 she detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother
4567467 it showed a side of her that made her very human
4567468 but think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4567469 does he not care about the future of their relationship
4567470 until the end the whole thing didnt seem real to him he didnt think anyone would be interested he didnt think wed get a publisher i dont think he thought that far ahead
4567471 we always thought we were fraternal until we took a dna test

4567496 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4567497 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4567498 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4567499 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4567500 the attorney general would have had a lot more credibility if he actually prosecuted government officials on occasion
4567501 he said he would not prosecute what is defined as a war crime in the case of torture
4567502 the gist of the new evidence is this roughly one quarter of saddams wmd was destroyed under un pressure during the early to mid 1990s saddam sold approximately another quarter of his weapons stockpile to his arab neighbors during the the russians insisted on removing another quarter in the last few months before the war the last remaining wmd the contents of saddams nuclear weapons labs were still inside iraq on the day when the coalition forces arrived in 2003 his nuclear weapons equipment was hidden in enormous underwater warehouses beneath the euphrates river saddams entire nuclear inventory was later stolen from these warehouses right out from under the americans noses

4567520 as on today the government has approved 1 15 lakh rooms which comes under star luxury hotel segment and 80 000 rooms are under construction according to federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry ficci the demand is of three lakh luxury rooms so the demand is much higher than the supply
4567521 mr bushs ratings on his handling of terrorism are like the stock market
4567522 if the headlines that day are about terror say the arrests in heathrow then his stock rises if they are not his stock falls the outcome in november rests greatly on what the headlines will be in october
4567523 this is about americas role in the world and how we fight and win
4567524 it is possible for the public to hold two contradictory thoughts in the same moment that mr bush made a huge mistake in going into iraq but that the democrats cannot be trusted to handle the issue responsibly
4567525 it is not enough to say that the war in iraq is disliked
4567526 the public also wants to know what the democrats would do about it
4567527 one of the other governors said what do you think
4567528 the public also wants to know what the democrats would do about it
4567529 weve been walking for a few minutes now the damage here is absolutely incredible
4567530 as you can see the centre of the town destroyed on a really wholesale scale more so than since the last civilians left here though it has to be said that on the outskirts the suburbs pretty much untouched by the israeli attack and invasion
4567531 across the valley the outer areas of town virtually intact the central streets though in a pitiful state
4567532 decisions of a kind for which the judiciary has neither aptitude facilities nor responsibility and which has long been held to belong in the domain of political power not subject to judicial intrusion or inquiry
4567533 the presidents action in warrantless wiretapping would be immunized from judicial scrutiny
4567534 i think the first step is if the lieberman thing turns into a side show and hurts our message and ability to take back the senate and the white house and the national republican senatorial committee manipulate him there are going to be a lot of unhappy people in our caucus
4567535 it would be terrific from my point of view that during the time in september october and early november if they campaign they spend their time in places other than connecticut
4567536 liebermans tone and message has shocked a lot of people
4567537 hes way off message for us and right in line with the white house
4567538 at this point lieberman cannot expect to just keep his seniority
4567539 he cant run against a democrat and expect to waltz back to the caucus with the same seniority as before it would give the view that the senate is a country club rather than representative of a political party and political movement
4567540 has been on vacation the last week and a half and has not been out there advocating what anyone should do regarding the connecticut election
4567541 if we pick up like ned lamont wants us to do get out by a date certain it will be taken as a tremendous victory by the same people who wanted to blow up these planes in this plot hatched in england
4567542 the resolution is clear that hizbullah needs to be removed from the border area embargoed and dismantled
4567543 if the resolution is not implemented we will have to take action to prevent the rearming of hizbullah i dont think backtracking will serve any useful purpose there has to be pressure on hizbullah to disarm or there will have to be another round
4567544 dismantling hizbullah is not the direct mandate of the un
4567545 he tried to be even handed in a situation that was clearly asymmetrical when one side committed crimes against humanity and engaged in genocide and the other side defended itself he cannot treat us in the same manner
4567546 i have been very hard on hizbullah and condemned hizbullah for what it has done i have condemned israel for what i consider excessive use of force but it doesnt mean i am taking one side
4567547 so ahmed is that a rocket in your pocket or are you just happy to see me
4567548 france wants the missions rules of engagement to be clear and it to have real means
4567549 sadly all too often the united nations forces dont have the power that they asked for
4567550 i know that a lot of military high ranking officials in france are reluctant if this mandate is not very precise
4567551 refraining from responding except where clearly required in immediate self defense
4567552 at this point there is no credible evidence of a terrorist activity
4567553 the government cant force hezbollah to abide by the ceasefire its unnatural to have an armed political party that is in cabinet and does not abide by what the government of lebanon wants
4567554 the lebanese army is readying itself along the litani to cross the river in 48 or 72 hours
4567555 hizbullah has to deliver its weapons to the lebanese army and its light weapons to the police
4567556 its fighters are welcome to join the military force and the state will then quickly regain control of all lebanese territories
4567557 im not telling hizbullah to surrender its weapons to israel or to the international community
4567558 i am telling it to surrender them to the lebanese army
4567559 if the secretary general of hizbullah has become the president of lebanon he has to let us know
4567560 we could have completed a cease fire by sunday morning but israel insisted on destroying the essence of lebanon
4567561 although the question whether the governments interest in preserving its national defense secrets is sufficient to trump the first amendment rights of those not in a position of trust with the government i e not holding security clearances is a more difficult question and although the authority addressing this issue is sparse both common sense and the relevant precedent point persuasively to the conclusion that the government can punish those outside of the government for the unauthorized receipt and deliberate retransmission of information relating to the national defense
4567562 the government must prove that the person alleged to have violated these provisions knew the restricted nature of the information knew that the person with whom they were communicating was not entitled to the information and knew that such communication was illegal but proceeded nonetheless
4567563 finally with respect only to intangible information as opposed to documents the government must prove that the defendant had a reason to believe that the disclosure of the information could harm the united states or aid a foreign nation
4567564 we must be aware of the fact that the war will continue for another few days
4567565 thats why we are continuing to fight today we will fight as long as israeli soldiers are in lebanon
4567566 we believe that the resolution that was taken last night was unfair
4567567 but if there is an agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the lebanese government and the enemy we will observe it without delay
4567568 we will not be an obstacle to any decision that it finds appropriate but our ministers will express reservations about articles that we consider unjust and unfair
4567569 regardless of our reservations and political positions we will cooperate when the lebanese soldiers and unifil forces are deployed
4567570 one week ago jack murtha said he wanted an immediate cease fire between israel and hezbollah he has said nothing since then to indicate he has rethought his position
4567571 this is the moment of truth and they do not want to give up their arms
4567572 we will not be an obstacle to any decision taken by the lebanese government
4567573 one good deed does not make up for a lifetime of mistakes
4567574 i propose a giuliani romney ticket as a southerner i understand my part of the country very well and i know we will support a giuliani romney ticket in a new york minute
4567575 we are the party seeking the icjs advisory opinion we believe in the icj and well respect its ruling
4567576 if this is bryan denton this is a serious meltdown level scandal for the media who have all along connived with the propagandists to do their work for him
4567577 one of the things that puts it on the radar screen is that its made from readily available materials
4567578 we have seen it overseas and thats what we look towards to see what might be coming our way
4567579 its a very sensitive material and mistakes in handling it will cause a premature detonation
4567580 are these ingredients readily available yes are they hard to detect yes would random searches on the subway system similar to what the nypd is doing curtail that its gonna make it much more difficult
4567581 we believe this is an ill advised term and we believe that it is counter productive to associate islam or muslims with fascism
4567582 we ought to take advantage of these incidents to make sure that we do not start a religious war against islam and muslims
4567583 we urge him bush and we urge other public officials
4567584 i have ordered the redeployment of security assets to high priority locations to respond to this threat
4567585 these assets include bomb sniffing dogs the california national guard and the california highway patrol in concert with local and federal law enforcement agencies
4567586 not only do you lose the match you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4567587 the olympics are considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4567588 we know when it touches us he knew that thats where it comes into calling it on yourself should i expect him to do that maybe not
4567589 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4567590 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4567591 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4567592 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4567593 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4567594 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us

4567620 the power of the swift boat accusations was based on the fact that kerrys fellow officers believed him unfit to be commander in chief
4567621 now corsis obama book while selling well doesnt have the same impact if he had written it with to come up with a hypothetical several of the ministers who worked with obama in the 1980s who say he is unfit for office then that would have been a big story and comparable to the swift boat book but those ministers arent saying that this is not 2004

4567662 if you are a republican then you dont care about people and you just care about money

4567665 capitalism is horrible it doesnt care about people at all and the only thing that benefits is big business and you admitted theres no such thing as a free market i mean im a patriot i believe in democracy
4567666 theres no such thing as democracy in its truest form how can every person have a voice and if they did there are unfortunately a lot of uneducated people whose voices may not bring change for the best anyways and its our fault they are uneducated

4567680 dont know while ive been on the force ive seen two holdup men shoot each other outside an abc store hunting accidents and that horrible incident when that bankers wife killed her son after school but this is the closest thing ive seen to an execution style murder very orderly hell the girl fell into a spot that looked like it was wiped clean of debris girl was pretty too and the blast from the back practically skinned the poor boy

4567695 mr tandy is a client of ours and we are in the process of launching civil proceedings as a result of the assault by joey barton our client has suffered a major psychiatric deterioration in his health that has destroyed any chance he may have had of playing professional football at a high level understandably this is a high profile case and at this stage we are unable to comment further
4567696 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa all the talks have been between our chief executive rick parry the owner and the chief executive of aston villa and those talks have all been pretty good so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
4567697 i think its almost exactly what we saw back in estonia
4567698 our children r suffering because of the educational financial disparity
4567699 when this sign is under water this road is impassable
4567700 the farmer allows walkers to cross the field free but the bull charges
4567701 its like he doesnt even know me anymore he used to know i wasnt that kind of person at least i thought he knew now he acts as if im some kind of psycho its like he never really knew me after all
4567702 yeah its weird but then people have always misunderstood me it seems i dont know why theyd say all these mean things about me once when i was sitting in a bathroom stall at elementary school i overheard some girl telling another girl oh that jenny thinks shes so hot it hurt i couldnt figure out where that came from i was never vain or snobbish or anything but people have often treated me like i was or like i was weird
4567703 are you sure they meant you and not some other jenny it is a common name
4567704 it could be they think youre a snob because youre shy that happens a lot with shy people but when i first saw you i knew you were just afraid of strangers and would be a fast friend with anyone who made you feel welcome
4567705 who knows maybe its also because i didnt know until i was nine or ten when my mom pointed it out to me that i was supposed to say hi back when someone said hi to me or that someone might feel slighted and think i was a snob if i didnt i didnt see it from that point of view since i also never realized i should say hi first once in a while coming to college has actually been a way to start fresh to break away from all that stuff that followed me every time i went to a new school here its not just people who know me or people who hear things about me its people from all over the country coming up with their own opinions about me and that makes scotts lies even more devastating because now there are new misunderstandings to follow me around
4567706 then again even while we were together he could sometimes be mean hed get mad at me for asking him to take me places hed ask why i didnt go there myself when i tried to explain that i kept getting lost and scared while driving he didnt listen
4567707 he acted like i was just being stupid and babyish like i could get over it if i just tried but i have tried and it doesnt work
4567708 let me ask you something when you first learned to drive did you know the way to places like the pharmacy and the grocery store
4567709 sure id been to many places around the city already and i already knew the way if i didnt it was easy enough to find with a map and maybe some directions if i got lost id just find my way again soon enough with a map
4567710 thats the weird thing even if ive been to a place a million times and know the way perfectly if i try to drive there ill get lost it just looks different from the drivers seat and maps confuse me i think i know exactly which direction to go based on a map and end up going in the opposite direction then i get scared and dont know what to do and even if i dont get lost im always scared that ill get into an accident or that people will honk at me or that ill get into an unfamiliar situation and wont know what to do when i get to my destination i step out and start trembling all over driving in the country is a lot easier but i still have to drive in the city just to get to the country i hate driving id rather go to the dentist
4567711 do you have a lot of trouble with unfamiliar situations
4567712 well i dont know right off hand what to do but i figure something out and then do it dont you
4567713 not usually i need someone to tell me what to do
4567714 no youre not stupid i dont understand why you have these problems when i was glad to start driving i think its a lot of fun and many of my friends also like it we love the freedom i love to get out on the open road especially
4567715 but i can see that whatever the reason for the way you feel its not something you know how to control it doesnt make you a bad or stupid person or a baby or any of that it just means you have a weakness that people will have to accept if theyre going to take you the way you are its almost a phobia except that phobias are irrational and it sounds like you have some reasons to be afraid of driving
4567716 whatever you want to do with your weakness thats up to you if you can drive youll be free gaining confidence is definitely a good thing and maybe practice will give it to you but belittling you for your fear will only make things worse forcing you to drive or else like scott tried to do is just mean its like dangling a plastic spider in front of someone with a spider phobia it wont help you get over it just make you jumpy and who wants a nervous jumpy driver sharing the road with them
4567717 its so good to hear you say that talking to you always makes me feel better
4567718 now im going to get gross from a runny nose and use up all your kleenex
4567719 i dont care that box has been there for weeks anyway somebody might as well use it
4567720 wait a minute if you havent been using kleenex what have you been wiping your nose on
4567721 not my shirt you little worrier i just dont get a runny nose that often and im not always here when i do
4567722 i cant take advantage of you youre upset and thats not the kind of comfort i planned to give you
4567723 you werent hm well still it doesnt change that im not the kind of guy who pretends to be a shoulder to cry on then takes advantage of a girls vulnerability and even if i were to kiss you with the best of intentions it would still appear that way and who knows where id stop with my roommate being away its probably better if we move to my car and talk there on the way back to your campus
4567724 youre sweet to not get mad but im not going to do that
4567725 okay well we messed up the landscape building so many new homes everywhere so its time to demolish all these homes and re institute land conservation

4567764 on the day of resurrection allah will not look at the one who dragged his garment out of pride
4567765 o messenger of allah my waistcloth slips down if i do not pay attention to it
4567766 you are not one of those who do it out of pride
4567767 do not worry about it because you did not let it slip on purpose
4567768 why do we find some texts on the subject fail to mention the condition of pride
4567769 this is because letting ones garments hang below the ankle gives an impression of pride and is therefore disliked as is anything else that gives an impression something sinful

4567806 singling out atlantic city for state oversight in land development projects while turning an official blind eye toward the history of corruption involving land deals in other major cities in the state
4567807 and is designed solely to wrest control of the future development of bader field out of the hands of local government
4567808 two weeks ago we witnessed former newark mayor sharpe james being sentenced to federal prison after being convicted on fraud and conspiracy charges involving the sale and development of municipally owned land
4567809 yet the bill signed into law by the governor was amended to exempt cities like newark and camden for example from its state oversight provisions
4567810 by signing the legislation the governor has made a clear statement that his administration considers atlantic city government to be untrustworthy while ignoring the very recent history of corruption in newark
4567811 state sen jim whelan who failed to call for the resignation of james from the senate when james was indicted obviously shares the governors view of the city government
4567812 crafting legislation singling out one municipality for state control over land development is not only poor public policy but a case of selective ethics as well
4567813 the future of bader field is crucial to the economic future of atlantic city and the entire region and great care must be exercised to assure its development is carried out openly and honestly
4567814 the same approach should apply to every other municipality in the state and its difficult to understand why the governor feels its only necessary here

4567817 if georgia is allowed to fall governments across eurasia will certainly take note especially those such as azerbaijan kazakhstan and ukraine that have built ties with the west and sought closer integration in european institutions drawing moscows ire should we allow russia to occupy georgia or even just depose the saakashvili government the implications for americas standing in eurasia would be dire
4567818 america to step up its campaign for nato membership for georgia and ukraine should european countries reject the idea america could designate them major non nato allies along the lines of israel and pakistan

4567820 anytime your athletes can excel in an academic setting you have to be pleased
4567821 to have a team gpa better than a 3 6 is very exciting and it says a lot about the quality of the young people that make up our program
4567822 when youve played a weekday night game away from home and dont get back until two oclock in the morning then have to get up and go to an eight oclock class well its challenging it all comes down to dedication and time management and weve been blessed to have some good athletes who understand the importance of academics

4567894 dont worry about that you have to move more than you eat
4567895 you come to the south and you are considered skinny if you are plump then you are still skinny
4567896 it is misleading to say tennessee is more obese than other states the change in obesity over time is not much different than the change in other states even skinny states are getting fat as quickly as we are we think it is a combo of environment and certainly the type of food we eat and the physical activity is a component of that for some people it is genetics and they are more susceptible to getting obese than others
4567897 you dont go to someone with diabetes and say you have a willpower problem or a character flaw but people really have that thought when we talk about obesity
4567898 why do we eat 3 meals a day as humans
4567899 animals dont eat three meals a day the answer because your momma told you to
4567900 feeding and food intake in humans is extraordinarily complex we also are beginning to understand things like addiction parts of the brain that tell you like cocaine and alcohol actually become activated in some kinds of food in some people for some increased food intake is food that have a lot of fat and sugar in them
4567901 the idea that obesity is a cosmetic disorder is not true when you are heavy your chance of having a heart attack goes up dramatically stroke goes up diabetes cancer and liver disease increase why should we care as a state because it is costing us a fortune
4567902 skinny people should care because they are paying for it

4567915 i am announcing that i will form an exploratory committee to run for president i want you to join me not just for the campaign but for a conversation about the future of our country about the bold but practical changes we need to overcome six years of bush administration failures as a senator i will spend two years doing everything in my power to limit the damage bush can do but only a new president will be able to undo bushs mistakes and restore our hope and optimism renew the promise of america the idea that if you work hard you can count on the health care education and retirement security that you need to raise your family these basic values of america are under attack from this administration only a new president can regain americas position as a respected leader in the world

4567917 they were increasingly concerned about improved u s intelligence that has allowed the americans to successfully target key figures in the militia

4567923 more than three fifths of those surveyed key phrase said the war was not worth fighting
4567924 surveyed 1 344 adults nationwide by telephone saturday through tuesday it has a margin of sampling error of three percentage points
4567925 forty one percent said congress should not attempt to stop bush with the rest unsure

4567953 you lift earlier you let your car coast longer you dont get up to the higher
4567954 i think it will help us somewhat there are some similarities between here
4567955 no in 2006 when i was right in the middle of it chase i think i was the only dodge last year ryan newman and kurt busch were the only two that were really good it just seems like its always like that there are one or two dodge cars that are really good we have to keep getting better if we want to make the chase and run well in the chase we need to keep getting better our team our company theyre doing a great job working with the teammates its been good we definitely have a lot of things that we can still do to run really well this year
4567956 i look at it every weekend every sunday night when i get home i keep it in mind if you want to make the chase you want to run well consistency is the name of the game for us right now weve been doing a good job of it weve been right there every weekend the cars have been really nice theyve been put together right the engines have been right its been good its been fun to drive
4567957 its not a big deal to me its neat that tony is a part of that team he got ryan to be his teammate thats good i think tony needs to have guys he knows that have won races before that helps the team when youve won you have certain ideas for what you need at certain race tracks thats a good thing with ryan and tony they both have those feelings to be able to help each other help the team and make things better quicker over there those two as teammates is no different than jimmie johnson and jeff gordon as teammates
4567958 i think you get more comfortable with what youre looking for in the car the more we work with the car the better the car seems to get i think our engineers and our crew chiefs are doing a really good job with the way our cars handle now so as a driver you know what you need and what youre looking for and you can work with those guys to make it better so yeah im much more comfortable in the car and a lot of it has to do with the car handling better and doing the right things it was kind of an unknown earlier in the year as compared to what we wanted in the old car but as time has gone by weve figured it out more and more its been a great season for us we started out pretty good i think were better now and hopefully in six weeks well be even better than what we are now
4567959 murali and mendis together make it a top attack we will have to do very well to defeat sri lanka
4567960 but while it was important to spend time out in the middle and get confidence under the belt yuvraj also felt that it was important to get the right result from the practice match
4567961 winning the match was very important because we were the favourites going into the game
4567962 theres always the motivation to score runs whether you miss out or you dont you always want to perform at your best i want to make sure this time when i go to sri lanka ill better my performances from last time
4567963 i prepared keeping in mind the conditions in sri lanka the targets of the team and its nice that i succeeded immediately in the practice match
4567964 the pitch was a little double paced the ball wasnt always coming on
4567965 at the same time yuvraj conceded that conditions in dambulla could be different and that the team needed to be flexible in its batting order
4567966 dambulla will be different conditions from here so we have to have partnerships to make a good score
4567967 its important we play according to the conditions and not peoples expectations

4567979 it will be a crazy travel schedule running double duty this weekend but will be a lot of fun ive never run on dirt before honestly i think its going to be a blast im really looking forward to it i honestly think we have a great chance at running well all weekend i want to thank eddie sharp for the opportunity and to both my east team for all their hard work
4567980 im really looking forward to heading to springfield this weekend we have been running great these last couple of weeks and we are heading into the home stretch of the season with great momentum my team has worked really hard and i really appreciate it

4567994 im really excited to go back to dixie last year we had our best run of the season there and i think that we should be able to improve on it this year
4567995 dixie is really an awesome race track and i think that it fits my driving style really well
4567996 this is an important weekend for us as we will be starting another three week stretch with out a weekend off we have not had any luck this year and are really hoping that we can turn our season around this weekend
4567997 at rockford we had a good race car but struggled in qualifying so we had our work cut out for us in the race we where in the top 15 with less than 20 laps to go when we where caught up in someone elses incident
4567998 at first we thought it was just some body damage
4567999 but when we went back green we started overheating and that was the end of our night
4568000 our motor was bad at wake county nc we thought we were going to be ok for this race but on the long run the motor got really hot and eventually it got to the point it was at wake
4568001 it almost didnt start after the red flag we were just trying to salvage our car and not get into any wrecks
4568002 this is where the toughest competition comes to race and this is where the action is
4568003 we still ended up second in points it was overall just a good season for us
4568004 my dad is always working long hours in the shop trying to find out how to make my car a little bit faster my mom is always there trying to help on the business end and my brother is there at the races cheering me on it is a family affair and we are all happy to be doing so well and running up front
4568005 our whole team has worked hard getting us to where we are just to have a shot at the championship even though we came up short is still a great season for us i think we have put our mark on the legends all summer our program has definitely stepped up and we hope to continue that into the fall we are going to try and keep the momentum going and try to get some more wins before the season is out
4568006 the staff at rockingham was extremely generous to work with
4568007 the facilities were great and we were planning on a having a top notch show the economics of staging a race with the size of the track and expenses of the television covering a large track were just too much for the southeast asphalt tour
4568008 truthfully we need to win reading or indy thats what it comes down to
4568009 i dont expect mike neff 10th place or jack beckman ninth place to dnq i dont expect them to perform poorly those two cars can run great my best draw would be to meet neff in the first round and beckman in the second round those are the types of things that happen its going to be exciting and were up to the challenge
4568010 i think we can really do well this weekend at maple grove i like the track
4568011 the first time that i ever went down a race track on a professional level was the right lane there in my alcohol funny car in 2006
4568012 tonight is the charity softball game for the draw charity which is going to be fun
4568013 its always good to do something for any charitable organization obviously we have our big jdrf thing coming up in indy but this softball game for draw will be a lot of fun its great they are getting the fans and the drivers together to raise money for a good cause it will be a good way of starting the weekend off and then we go to work well see where we end up
4568014 i am glad i won when i crossed the finish line i was going crazy in the car because i won the championship i have wanted to win the championship at the shootout since i ran bandoleros here i almost won it in young guns i ended up second last year i was sixth in semi pro this year it was just awesome
4568015 our car was maybe a 10th place car or maybe a little bit better than that we came up here one monday night for practice and found a setup and we have stuck with that every week we won two races with that setup and would have won three but i drove off in the corner on the final lap tonight and got loose
4568016 we had two races due to the rain the week before i had the fastest car out there on the track i finished second in the first one and first in the second one i looked in my mirror and the 680 bryce walker was right there all he had to do is finish one position behind me to win the championship and that was what he did
4568017 we are leading the points at lanier national speedway ga so we are going to run there and other tracks for the rest of the year we are also going to go up to the nationals later this year and hopefully it will be our names on the championship trophy there too
4568018 this should be a lot of fun this weekend plus i get to come back home and race
4568019 i enjoy running with the asa late model series but theres nothing at all like racing in front of your family and friends
4568020 we qualified third fastest and i thought we really had a good shot at a win but things happen and well bounce back in the next asalms south race i have to thank allen hock motorsports for a great opportunity
4568021 they told me that all i had to do this race was to get in one lap under the green
4568022 we ran about a quarter of the lap and there was a caution i got a little nervous because i thought something was going to happen to me then the raceceiver battery died but we got it working again while i was out there running
4568023 we were going for the win from the start like we always do but i was also trying to drive a little more cautiously than i usually do i was trying to stay out of every wreck there was a wreck right in front of us off of turn four i had to use a really safe move i wasnt sure if i was going to dodge it but luckily we did luckily we got the championship
4568024 this has been a great year for my a 1 finchum heating amp cooling team i have to thank all of them for their hard work and dedication every week if it wasnt for them my mom and my dad i wouldnt be able to win races and championships leading up to the shootout and i wouldnt have been able to win eight races and the championship in my 19 embassy suites charlotte concord golf resort amp spa bandolero in the summer shootout series at lowes motor speedway my sponsors have all been vital to the success of our race team and i want to thank them for their continued support of my career
4568025 our cars are driving much better now with the updates from howe i think bristol showed that we are on the right track as well as all of the howe cars that were there
4568026 jordan dahlke started on the pole and ran second the throughout the first 100 looking at the lead but being patient and got dumped at the line for some reason not of his own doing travis dassow ran real well too
4568027 this is as close to home as it gets for us so hopefully the good lord willing we will have a stout piece right off the truck and get us a good run in i believe we can win at any time its just a matter of when its our day
4568028 we are looking forward to dixie we tested there back in july and it went well the chevy we wrecked at bristol was a bit faster but we put everything out of that car in our ford so we will we see
4568029 we are really looking forward to coming home in the backup car that we had tested at dixie already with
4568030 hopefully we can win this thing in our home state we need some good luck
4568031 bristol was a heartbreaker for us we chased the car all day friday fighting a bad loose condition and you dont want to be that there
4568032 we kept working on the car and making it better and made it really comfortable to drive it was great to see the guys work so hard and the car just keep getting better and better
4568033 when it came to qualifying i was conservative because of what we had seen out of other cars wrecking on the second lap so i just put down a lap that would get us in the show
4568034 we found our way up to the top six by lap 100 and the car was really almost perfect i was able to just ride and pass some good cars
4568035 at the break we just made an air pressure adjustment and went back out
4568036 unfortunately early in the second half the car got loose getting in i saved it but got hit from behind and spun in front of the field and got ran into the side of the drivers door
4568037 i just hate it for auto value bumper to bumper certified service centers and all the guys the car was on a rail
4568038 any time you wreck up front running good thats a hard pill to swallow but from where we have been we will take it and roll on
4568039 he was fine afterwards hes got a nice bruise on his left shoulder but i could see it in his eyes he was ready
4568040 bristol was absolutely a wonderful experience for everyone at team finley racing i thought he did a great job right out off the truck as a driver
4568041 i have to give a big thanks to the entire crew bob and theresa cumbow forrest chuck everybody
4568042 with a lovably quirky script lovely production values and delightful performances by a strong cast gaudi afternoon is seidelmans best film yet
4568043 we had a lot of fun shooting shifting gears and i think the fans enjoyed watching it
4568044 i was glad to hear we are releasing it on dvd because that gives me my family and my fans a really nice documentation of my first year at hendrick motorsports to keep forever plus the dvd will include bonus footage that never made the show im actually looking forward to seeing that myself
4568045 its going pretty good we only have one dnf this year
4568046 this is a nice track and once you learn how to get around this track you can go anywhere and race the setup is about the same anywhere we go
4568047 its pretty good here the owners are really good most of the drivers are really good and its tough competition
4568048 i would love to get a chance to go and drive for joe gibbs racing ill drive a toyota
4568049 we finished in the top ten at daytona we started in the 20s
4568050 we actually led some laps under caution we didnt have a really great car we had a three year old pontiac which didnt have the aero we needed to get around there i would try to pass a car on the straightaway there once and i had a run on him pulled out to pass and ended up three car lengths behind him going into the corner
4568051 this is a great opportunity if it hadnt have been for jerry moskel team owner being so generous to think of tiffany in the first place for being a driver this never wouldve come about for me
4568052 i feel like i was put in a really great position to be able to have the opportunity to navigate for tiffany as she was originally scheduled to be one of three drivers to race then it just so happened that i was given the opportunity to be one of the drivers so of course im really looking forward to it
4568053 i think that starting off navigating will help when i drive when i first get in the truck i will be scheduled to navigate for several checkpoints
4568054 then when its time for me to hop in the truck and drive the experience that i will get navigating will help me relate to following the map and understanding how tiffany is directing us
4568055 our over all goal in this is undoubtedly going to be to finish the race weve seen many types of racing like this before
4568056 even something that would relate to us would be driving on a road course in a stock car the drivers who can keep their cars on course and out of trouble will finish the race and finish well i think the same would apply to this race if we can stay out of harms way i know we have a very well prepared truck to be driving so we dont expect any kind of mechanical failures although you never know what could happen if we can stay clean avoid trouble and finish the race we hope to have a good result
4568057 its always nice to go back to a circuit where youve won
4568058 its going to be a tough race so its nice to get some testing in
4568059 you cant test during a race weekend and youve got to come in with a plan and really go for it
4568060 qualifying is tough and its important to do consistent fast laps and then we go racing its nice to get a day of testing in
4568061 i think you will see some new passing with this change
4568062 its a tough corner because youre going from the fastest section of the track to the slowest but it should be good
4568063 were looking forward to going to dixie this weekend they have a nice little track there in michigan
4568064 we had some bad luck there last year so we hope to
4568065 i think troy should do real well there he established the asalms track record last year and we hope he can break that this time
4568066 the northern division is very competitive this year every finish counts
4568067 josh is continuing to improve every time out at rockford he cut down a tire with 10 laps to go otherwise he wouldve have had a better finish
4568068 hes doing a heck of job for only running in about 10 asalms races in his career this is very tough series and hes learning a lot by racing with the best
4568069 this is going to a rough three weeks in a row

4568121 rick ren crew chief the no 33 camping world crew and everybody at khi give me great trucks and they are really fun to drive we are taking a really good truck to bristol a truck that we have won with earlier this year and i know that we will be one the teams to beat when we unload
4568122 track position is a key factor at bristol qualifying is as important as the race itself and usually plays into the outcome of the race but you can work your way from the back and win at bristol so pit stall selection and pit stops are also key factors
4568123 another thing that is really important at bristol is that your driver needs to know where he is at on the track it is easy for a driver to lose track of whether they are on the front or backstretch the driver needs to know where he is so he doesnt miss pit road a lot of times the driver is lapping trucks so fast that ill tell him who the next truck for position is and he might have to pass three or four lapped trucks for position
4568124 i think drivers have the best understanding of what it takes to be a good spotter so it should give you and your team an advantage
4568125 as a past driver you can watch the lines a driver is using in practice and suggest a different way around the track because you have an understanding of what the car truck needs to do to go faster

4568130 this year is going to be a little different than years past it used to be the schedule lightened up after knoxville and it was more about just a couple of shows a week with all the weather problems we had early in the year the western swing is a little more compact were racing every couple of nights kind of like we did in july id say its going to test some teams out here but this tony stewart racing team has been through the wars many times and i know were all looking forward to it we want to go out and win as many races as we can crew chief ricky warner and crewmen shane bowers and kyle sundby have done a great job all year and theyre prepared to keep us going strong the rest of the season
4568131 when you want to win as bad as i do there is pressure every night its a great honor to be able to race in front of north dakotans and visit new tracks for years the outlaws had one event each year in north dakota and that was in fargo i tried everything i could to win that race and finally was able to do so in 2002 now weve got three other tracks to race at weve been close in minot the past couple of years but just havent quite made it work fortunately i was able to win in grand forks this year so maybe well get the first one at dacotah speedway right away in the armor all chevy parkerstore no 15

4568135 with the way our season has gone thus far anything could happen at any track not just bristol i have never been one to be too concerned about the point standings until the race is over right now the no 2

4568153 good morning everyone we want to welcome you to this mornings press conference obviously you pretty much know what its all about well go ahead and introduce our folks ryan newman tony stewart and general manager of haas
4568154 tony its pretty obvious why were all here today its capped off a month long bit of announcements but today another important piece of the puzzle at stewart haas
4568155 we were joking about it before we came over here this is the best kept secret im like are you kidding me i dont know that anything ive done in the last eight months has been a secret
4568156 so were just more excited to be able to let everybody else know
4568157 it keeps giving us a greater depth of people that we have as an option now to get over to the race team and add to the people that we have right now it makes this team even stronger than what it was a couple weeks ago already
4568158 ryan this brings together two indiana natives two guys with a lot of deep usac roots why make the decision to move to stewart haas next year
4568159 just a great opportunity i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint ive seen the success from an ownership standpoint with the
4568160 hes a hard nose racer become a good friend as an opposing competitor so it says a lot about that i just look forward to the experience hopefully our main goal is that we both achieve our goals and thats winning championships and both being in the chase
4568161 finally joe custer general manager of the team joe youve seen this team grow a lot in the last month talk about this latest development to the operation
4568162 its overwhelming in ways you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable we welcome ryan of course haas automation general motors all the supporters of our efforts key players in this were thrilled tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it to have ryan part of it i mean what can we say the rocket man is on board
4568163 just to note tony of course is from columbus ind ryan is from south bend ind the two of these guys bring together a combined 57 usac wins and 45 sprint cup wins well make this easy and simple well open it up to the media
4568164 we only had to sedate him for about four straight days laughter at which point you have the subliminal messages you just replay over in a loop after four days of that i was really surprised it took really well woke up and seemed to think that the week went by really quick laughter
4568165 you know what i think the big thing talking to ryan and krissie these guys was just explaining to them how the organization was going to be
4568166 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was he asked all the right questions from day one
4568167 those were the questions that really impressed me the most with ryan it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to give him quality cars and equipment and people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4568168 id say the biggest reservation kind of happened back in daytona when we won that race
4568169 as far as answering the part about tony and my history from racing usac midgets silver crown cars he was id say two to three years ahead of me as far as where his curve was moving up getting to nascar and racing in what was the busch car national series i went to him for advice he actually i dont know if he remembers this he asked me to come out to an irp test when i was down at indy when he was racing one of his nationwide cars then just to come out and be a part of it as somebody that knew where i was and where i wanted to go where he was and where he was going hes always been a friend hes looked out for me that said a lot even back then
4568170 were all seeing effects of the economy from the sponsorship side obviously
4568171 were currently working on sponsors for ryans car we were hoping to have them done for today but we didnt get it done in time so hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4568172 but its just making sure that we put the right partners together when youre working with multiple sponsors its making sure that you have the continuity between the two to make sure it works for both parties it makes it a little harder and the process is a little harder to get the contract it is done
4568173 im not sure were down to fine details yet but were getting close
4568174 yeah without naming names there were an easy three other teams that made me offers on offer sheets
4568175 to answer the second part of the question it was mostly tony
4568176 when tonys situation came to light and those things became more public it was easier to understand those things for me
4568177 you know obviously getting to run both cars this week im excited about trying to help continue that streak with the nationwide side that team and at the same time maybe hopefully getting our first win of the season here this weekend
4568178 absolutely and i think if you look at the history of roger penske and roger didnt have the ultimate stats that tony stewart does but roger was a racer you know that i think is extremely important to me to have somebody that understands the driving part of it the ownership part of it the teammate part of it the personnel part of it which is extremely important nowadays that meant a lot so yeah roger i still have a lot of respect for him and look forward to the rest of the season fulfilling my obligations but i definitely see the true racer and the potential future businessman in tony stewart
4568179 yeah weve been in a lot of meetings in the last four weeks with a lot of different people from different organizations that have come to us wanting to be a part of this joe has been a huge part of that you know its just talking to the right people
4568180 you know its like i was telling somebody you dont have an option until you have at least two people
4568181 you know like i say its nice having options with the announcement today hopefully even more people are going to come out and want to be a part of the program because of ryan that just gives us that many more options and people to choose from hopefully
4568182 but it is coming together we are getting people hired we have commitments from people that were currently working on contracts right now that are some key people that we think are really going to be able to help us build this program
4568183 when roger and i shook hands saying i wasnt going to come back he knew from my standpoint that i was going to be the dedicated driver ive always been and i will do my best for myself most importantly but as well as the sponsors and alltel kodak people that have obviously been a big part of my career
4568184 ive focused just as much on driving the no 12 car as i will be next year driving the no 4 car you know like i said i still have a lot of respect for roger i believe roger still has a lot of respect for me well continue on as i said to roger its going to be business as usual that will end at the end of 08
4568185 well that wasnt as big a factor as just knowing that weve got somebody thats as passionate about our program as we are and somebody that we know is going to be competitive every week thats something that ryans already proved in his career in the cup series
4568186 you know obviously were working really hard to keep scott riggs driver of the no 66 haas cnc racing chevrolet in the top 35 right now and that would ensure that ryan doesnt have to do what he does best thats going out and getting front rows and poles and everything were trying to work really hard the rest of the season to accomplish that so we dont put that pressure on ryan thats something thats really big to the organization right now that we do everything we can to keep that 66 car in the top 35 in points let him worry about going out and racing not worrying about going out and qualifying the first five weeks
4568187 we sat down at the shop we talked about it signed the paperwork
4568188 the no 4 i know what that means to tony stewart i have numbers that mean more to me than the no 4 does but im here at stewart haas racing and i respect the no 4 and his decision he told me it was his first go kart number that means a lot to me because i have some of my first race cars with the no 43 on them which obviously are notorious here i look forward to representing that number with this team
4568189 we dont have senses of humor very dull quiet people both of us laughter
4568190 no the thing is theres going to be a lot of work involved in what were doing here but at the same time i mean weve got a teammate now and weve got an organization that realizes that
4568191 to see somebody like ryan and me around there each day i think will be something those guys will like ryan likes to fish i like to fish we both raise baby deer we have a lot of common interests i think this is something were both going to have a lot of fun doing
4568192 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing than anything
4568193 but were going to have a lot of fun with this thats something that is important as hectic and busy and tedious as the schedule keeps getting each year it grows its not gotten easier its got harder every year to have somebody like ryan on board that you know youre going to have fun with that makes you look forward to going and having fun every day
4568194 matt borland i talked to him a couple times on and off hes still a great friend of mine obviously a super technical person has obviously a huge influence at stewart haas with respect to the race cars he was off the record a good person to talk to you know i appreciated his input
4568195 krissie newman obviously was my sounding board at the house she would elbow me somewhere between 12 and five in the morning at some points just to wake me up and talk about what i wasnt doing she was typically more stressed out and high strung about me making my decision and having a lot of input with that decision so she was very helpful to me no different than my parents who helped push me through college she helped push me through this situation and im very grateful for that
4568196 but yeah it made a difference but it wasnt the ultimate reason by any means
4568197 for me you know i can kind of speak on tonys behalf as much as he does mine its about us having crew chiefs that get along together and as a group between the drivers crew chiefs race engineers they have a common chemistry
4568198 so you know a lot of that is up to tony and the people at stewart haas to make those decisions obviously i want to have the input to have somebody i can personally get along with well address that situation as it comes
4568199 ive seen multi car organizations that the crew chiefs were in different directions with each other and they dont utilize the opportunity of what a two car team is all about in the right way
4568200 were going to rely on ryans input as much as anybodys you know to make this decision
4568201 i dont think theres a lot of teams and organizations that have had a scenario where they get to go out at the same time and go after two crew chiefs so you know maybe this is something that will even be that much better for us
4568202 i want to have that influence i want to have that communication i want to be successful with tony and with the organization doing so its just a matter of the right time and the right place just like anything else in the world
4568203 this is the beginning of the process just like tony said there are going to be people that hopefully after tony announces im here will want to come and be part of the organization that is one of the first this is the concrete for the foundation lets say for building a perfect team a perfect organization
4568204 did you write that on paper so i can answer it laughter
4568205 im not sure i was coherent when i did it laughter
4568206 i signed it just recently we have had discussions for the last little bit but obviously i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
4568207 i do not know the status of matt borlands contract agreement where he stands with the team that would be a good question for matt
4568208 going to the media center is a hell of a lot more fun now its a multi year agreement
4568209 i dont think weve ever been like that have we
4568210 obviously were not going to work against each other but were not in a position to work for each other either its the right time right place give and take type situation no different than it ever has been
4568211 its business as usual its just about respect out there weve always had respect for each other even though we drove for different teams now that were going to be on the same side next year that respect wont change it will still be there
4568212 im contracted and fulfilling my contract with penske racing to do what ive been contracted to do for the rest of the year and thats drive the no 12
4568213 as far as previous ownership i think theres only one person that im aware of we both drove for that was steve chrisman that was in
4568214 he drove all that stuff after i tore it all up and had gone to another team he got to drive all the bent stuff laughter
4568215 yeah the chevrolet part of it im excited about obviously tony is super excited about it its a new deal for me i look forward to putting the chevrolet in victory lane
4568216 with the tie to hendrick thats obviously assumed to be a good thing thats part of the reason i feel its going to be successful and i look forward to driving what currently even now is a hendrick car at stewart haas racing
4568217 oh it is for sure the team has all been working really hard were trying to all move forward and learn together because its our first year together its the first year for the 77 car first year for mobil to be back as a primary sponsor its obviously been a tough go of it at times this season but coming to these tracks where we had strong runs at the first time we feel like were really poised to be able to come back and start looking at hopefully having top 10 finishes so i think the big thing for us to do is just keep our heads up we saw big improvements at tracks that we were able to go to for the second time this season so far even if we had a bad race there the first time so hopefully thatll mean that the ones that we did good at well be even better
4568218 keep the hot dog wrappers off the grill but i dont know that i can do anything about that smiles i
4568219 id say last year was just because we were doing the indycar we were doing the nationwide car we were ramping up to do cup races i ran the 24 hours of daytona and i did some go karting stuff as physical fitness for the indycar road course racing this year has been a little bit scaled back from that but thats how it is i guess
4568220 it will be a crazy travel schedule running double duty this weekend but will be a lot of fun
4568221 im really looking forward to running with the camping world series at lime rock we head straight to illinois after the race saturday and sunday i get to run on dirt for the first time its going to be a blast i honestly think we have a great chance at winning both races i want to thank eddie sharp for the opportunity and to both my east team for all their hard work
4568222 i really enjoy running on road courses and this will be a great warm up for the september race in new jersey new jersey motorsports park
4568223 i dont know what really to expect ive never been pitted a car on the dirt so it will be a new challenge for me but i am looking forward to it our luck has been starting to turn around so hopefully it will continue this weekend
4568224 ive never been to a dirt track race at all so im really looking forward to sunday afternoon from what ive been told patrick runs really well on these types of tracks so i hope we can get a good finish
4568225 i enjoy running on the dirt it reminds me of the old saturday night short track racing that i grew up around patrick is a very successful dirt racer which gives us an advantage this weekend i did a lot of dirt racing in my driving career in fact the last dirt race i ran was at springfield in an arca re max series car back in 2001 where i finished fifth so coming back to this track does have some meaning to me
4568226 going to a dirt track should be fun especially from the spotters stand i think everyone has a real good feeling about our chances this weekend so im sure ill be putting a little bit extra pressure on myself but ill take it if it means we end up in victory lane
4568227 ill be the first to admit i was not a big fan of the dirt but over the years of coming to the arca races on the dirt ive begun to enjoy them year after year its a lot of fun and the racing is great im looking forward to sunday
4568228 im just glad to be going to the dirt with a great team and an experienced driver the weather is going to be comfortable and im going to have family there so it really doesnt get any better than this
4568229 i went with the team last year on the dirt and it was a good time patrick knows how to get around these places so that gives the team some extra confidence ill have family and friends in attendance this weekend for me so its an extra special weekend for me
4568230 racing is racing but im looking forward to my first arca race on the dirt this weekend to be honest im more excited about this race than our biggest race of the year at daytona international speedway we should have a good car and im looking forward to seeing what all the buzz has been about for myself
4568231 this is a big race for us and everyone anticipates us to be in the hunt for the victory as a team weve improved since our first two dirt races together last year so hopefully if history repeats itself the team can be celebrating in victory lane sunday afternoon
4568232 im ready to go i could climb in the car and go racing now obviously ive been counting down the days to this race im relaxed im feeling good im just ready to climb in the car and get dirty
4568233 ive had a lot of success on the dirt including a couple wins so i know that this team is plenty capable of going to victory lane this weekend if nothing crazy happens there is no doubt that patrick will get up on that wheel and well find ourselves in victory lane as a team on sunday afternoon
4568234 i grew up around the dirt tracks so i enjoy going to them even in the arca re max series the intensity is what drives me and i think that intensity will be there this weekend at springfield
4568235 im ready its really intriguing to see 3400 pound stock cars slash around the dirt for 100 laps its something that you have to see with your own eyes we were strong on the dirt last year and im hoping for a repeat performance this weekend

4568243 pre race ceremonies for a sprint cup series event are always exciting and this one will be no different
4568244 being able to grant a make a wish to a child like austin is really special to have him participate in the ceremonies with a wonderfully accomplished country star like danielle peck will be exciting for him mr campbell and the whole 3m company is in its third year of sponsoring a cup race with us and we have really enjoyed our relationship with them
4568245 were doing everything we can to round up votes for the alltel all star contest
4568246 so far so good but theres a long way to go we have to keep up the momentum and keep the votes coming to us that 10 000 would be a real big help to our team
4568247 we werent in the handicapping rotation so we had to start last 10th in our heat but we came up through to finish fourth
4568248 i started 14th in the feature and got up to about 10th before i got into the wall because i was trying to ru n really high on the track i think that bent the tie road and then it broke a couple laps later
4568249 we were running decent but i dont know how it wouldve turned out

4568253 driver amp team confident first win could come sunday afternoon
4568254 im ready to go i could climb in the car and go racing now
4568255 obviously ive been counting down the days to this race im relaxed im feeling good im just ready to climb in the car and go
4568256 we had a good run at springfield last year third place in my first dirt arca race i was comfortable with that this year its a different ball game our sheltra motorsports team is capable of winning and this is the prime place for us to shine we plan to make the best of it
4568257 running on the dirt in these 3400 pound cars is nothing like what im accustomed to in the late models
4568258 however the driving style doesnt really change that much sure you have to adapt but its pretty much the same concept which is an advantage to me there are some other dirt track specialists that will be competing this weekend so its not going to a run away show by any means but i can tell you this we expect to be up front and we hope to be the first car that takes the checkered flag
4568259 we had a good chevrolet last year on the dirt but to keep up with the competition we felt like the dodge charger offers a better advantage and that extra push to run even better than we did last year the car is good and we have a good setup underneath it so im good
4568260 the series has been so competitive this year so it seems like even if you run good you cant make up a lot of ground because everyone else is running well its a lot different from last year this weekend is a race we can gain some serious ground in and while the win is important to us inching forward in the standings is just as crucial
4568261 we had great success at michigan with pearson we went up there and went out to practice the car didnt run as good as we wanted as i watched the car come by on the track it looked high didnt look right so he pearson pulled in and were sitting on some tires discussing it david said to me it looks like to me that its awful high oh gosh the thought hit me you know you always raise the car up to transport it you always raise it 10 rounds to load it and unload it
4568262 so we got to lowering the thing back down and gosh when we lowered the thing down it ran so good man i thought that helped it so good that im going to lower it three more rounds so i lowered it three more rounds and somehow we got through inspection
4568263 when he came in it was so low you couldnt roll a soda can under it that was a good day that was a fun day
4568264 biggest break in 1991 a photo finish in the champion spark plug 400 for the no 21 citgo ford would become another most memorable race at michigan international speedway for the wood brothers due to a late strategy call by eddie wood to stop for fuel only
4568265 that was big it was probably my first real call that i made that was right and we won the race
4568266 staggering is the difference between the size of the left rear tire and the right rear tire and the left front tire and the right front tire
4568267 there was a restart with nine or 10 laps to go it was the best set of tires all day i think davey allison got tied up on the restart then here comes davey he caught up to us and could stay with us but couldnt pass so we beat him by about a foot we hadnt won since like 1987 with kyle petty it gave dale jarrett his first win and it was right in front of ford it was a big day
4568268 it got too far down the road but we almost got it put back together in the end dale was one of our best friends then and still is right now to this day you have those things throughout your career every now and then when things just click with everybody involved and that was just one of those times
4568269 last week was last week and that was a really good week for us hopefully this week will be as equally good it will be our first time with the newly designed car that we have a chassis that we havent run in the past at a track this size and with this banking first thing we have to do is make the show and once we do that then we can dial in the car for a good race hopefully it will be just fine were on the verge of getting our program straightened out hopefully this week will be a big step toward that things dont have to be great just go forward

4568280 the gurian method recognizes that boys and girls learn differently
4568281 boys and girls have a significant difference in neurological make up brain chemistry and adolescent development
4568282 as a result there is less acting out i notice that my students respect me more because i am in tune with where they are not where i expect them to be
4568283 theres far less need to impress people in an all boys environment or an all girls environment
4568284 and thats why you see public schools gravitating towards it it allows them to have a more distinct focused environment
4568285 having kids just do seat work is not going to work well for boys
4568286 you have them participate more in projects class discussions and activities
4568287 what salesian had to offer was camaraderie brotherhood and a family atmosphere
4568288 it creates an environment where theres no reason to be fake
4568289 when theres a girl in the room theyre competing for the attention of the girl without the girl in the room theyre competing for the grade theyre competing for the attention of the teacher
4568290 they work hard to find out what a problem is and get him a student back on track whether it is academic or social
4568291 at the coed school you get judged more than at an all male school
4568292 at the coed school everybody shows off because of the girls but here nobody shows off because its just guys
4568293 i wouldnt be a councilmember today if it wasnt for salesian high school
4568294 it provided a family atmosphere in which to flourish and be part of something positive
4568295 in a nutshell the brotherhood aspect of the high school the goofiness and the competition coupled with the focus on spirituality makes the high school experience more meaningful
4568296 separate sex education certainly offers opportunities for some of our communities
4568297 the critical foundation and first step for reforming our schools must come from creating small safe and independent schools that empower parents and teachers and gives them a real voice in the classroom if parents and teachers believe that all male or all female education is the best method for their students then they should be the ones making that decision once the foundations to reform are in place
4568298 so what starts to happen is that young men dont know how to act like young men
4568299 in this era the latino boys need something to do
4568300 when you talk to these young men it is so inspiring they say they dont have the distraction of girls so they can focus on their studies
4568301 you have to provide boys with a little different approach brewer said
4568302 boys tend to be hyperactive especially early on they tend to mature later in life
4568303 there has to be a mentoring component especially with those boys who do not have role models in the home or in the community
4568304 our inspiration has been equitable as to how boys learn from single gender instruction and how girls learn from single gender instruction
4568305 it would be focused on how boys and girls learn differently according to gender
4568306 many of our families are from either mexico or central america or from korea
4568307 we can lure people who are like minded and are willing to work in this kind of environment that we are not forcing anyone like we would in a conversion
4568308 we cant rely on a cookie cutter approach and that is because our children come with different learning styles and different home environments and different ways of learning so we need to structure the learning environment in ways that meet their needs
4568309 if we know we can get better results for kids if we know that an all male classroom works more effectively for our kids then we should move in that direction we want to meet the needs of our kids and for some of our kids we arent meeting their needs
4568310 as our own species is in the process of proving one cannot have superior science and inferior morals the combination is unstable and self destroying
4568311 i think the audience would be insulted if you did because then you feel this obvious pressure to appeal
4568312 the beauty of the evil dead movies is that youre only appealing to one demographic and thats people who like horror movies and you just have to please them you dont have to appeal to the studio youre already pleasing them by giving them part 4
4568313 well its a bit of a tease but i must say that the truth of the matter is i couldnt come to an agreement with the filmmaker about what type of film we wanted to make so we felt it was best rather than jeopardize what i consider to be a good friendship we let it go so it fell apart and i dont think itll come back together again

4568322 cuando nos planteamos redise ar las salas dedicadas al antiguo egipto que no hab an sufrido ning n cambio en m s de 20 a os decidimos iniciar un di logo con los visitantes sobre cu l es la mejor manera de exhibir las momias
4568323 yo creo que hay que regresar las momias a sus tumbas como una muestra de respeto respeto al ser humano m s all de cualquier culto creencia o religi n respeto por personas que pidieron descansar en paz
4568324 seqenen ra ta ii llamado el m rtir es un h roe para los antiguos egipcios no es necesario mostrar su agon a al momento de morir el dolor en sus brazos en sus manos por qu estamos mostrando un hombre tan importante para nosotros de esa forma
4568325 nosotros nos hemos planteado c mo exhibir las momias de una forma correcta respetuosa protegi ndolas del deterioro pero nunca hemos pensado en dejar de exhibirlas
4568326 son personas muertas que deben ser enterradas o s mbolos de la antigua cultura egipcia nosotros pensamos que son parte de nuestra herencia no cad veres que representan la fant stica habilidad de los antiguos egipcios para preservar a estos seres queridos
4568327 para m las momias son personas muertas no son monumentos no son piedras no son estatuas no son pilares son seres humanos carne hueso sangre
4568328 existen adem s decenas de textos que nosotros llamamos maldiciones donde se amenaza a quien interrumpa el sue o de los faraones aquellos que me despierten de mis descanso eterno enfrentar n el fuego o la muerte vendr con alas r pidas contra aquellos que entren a mi tumba tomen mis cosas o manipulen mi cuerpo y hay muchos m s
4568329 la mayor a de las momias exhibidas tanto en el museo egipcio como en todo el mundo fueron movidas mucho tiempo atr s de sus tumbas originales en el pasado egipto sufri varias invasiones y los antiguos egipcios movieron las momias a ubicaciones secretas para protegerlas as que nosotros no las hemos sacado de su lugar de origen
4568330 yo no estoy de acuerdo con la excusa del estudio cient fico y le pongo como ejemplo la momia de tutmosis i desde que fue colocado en su caja de vidrio en el museo egipcio d cadas atr s tiene un signo de pregunta al lado de su nombre entonces por m s que lo han sacado de su tumba nunca hemos estado seguros de que se trate de tutmosis i
4568331 desde la perspectiva isl mica yo me tom el trabajo de preguntarle a alguna de nuestras eminencias religiosas si es correcto exponer gente muerta de esa manera y estas figuras me dijeron que desde el punto de vista isl mico no es correcto m s all de la creencia de esa persona
4568332 si uno le pregunta a cualquiera que nos muestre a su abuelo de esa forma por 100 libras egipcias alguien estar a de acuerdo yo lo dudo
4568333 desde una perspectiva isl mica o desde un enfoque basado en las creencias del antiguo egipto
4568334 si tenemos una serie de momias vinculadas a un per odo hist rico determinado mantenidas en buena condici n lo que estamos haciendo es mostrar uno de lo grandes misterios del pasado

4568427 after a year of studying various agreed statements that have come out of ecumenical dialogues between anglicans and roman catholics on the national and international level these episcopal clergy expressed an interest in having a dialogue on the local level and asked my permission to make an appointment to talk with bishop vann the stated goal of these official anglican roman catholic dialogues which have been going on for over 40 years has been full visible unity between the two communions

4568436 one day will be devoted to each of the four sub sectors for which guidance is needed the first day will be dedicated to road users truckers automobile drivers those who travel by train and all who work in transportation related services the second to women on the streets the third to children on the streets and the fourth to the homeless
4568437 the most important thing to keep in mind is that the church is committed to raising awareness and helping people who use the road to gain a sense of responsibility to decrease traffic accidents the contribution of the christian community is necessary but in addition to the church schools families and institutions must also work to further this cause and work to create respect for applicable laws
4568438 the scary statistics we hear on the television and read in the daily newspapers that demonstrate a lack of respect for life that is why we have called this summit in october in bogot to look for a way to confront the problem it will begin with the continental conference and will later focus on the parish and diocesan environments another important topic tied to the street is that of children being forced to beg or rummage through garbage

4568448 very simple screw bush screw the gop some enlightened pundit will no doubt be able to offer the reassuring words that will convince me to remain active in politics but i doubt it the list of atrocities committed by bush and the gop congress through 2006 were enough to have us lose to the dhimmis the dhimmis by god the dhimmis does anyone in the gop have any idea how badly you must screw up to be defeated by the dhimmis they obviously dont care both parties but the bush gop seems to be leading are pandering to the latino vote both read the latest info from the census and the birth rates mark steyn where are you i am sure i will cool off but coupling the immigration debacle with the latest on iraq now we got a czar not to mention peace in our time with iran amp nk has me to the point of opting out for good everyone from my local councilman to the state legislature to the gov to the congress to the bush want more of my money more of my liberty and more of my soul they got my money but they will not compromise my soul i can no longer accept any statement from any government entity or candidate as the truth or any program as being in my self interest everything is in the self interest of the politicians even the war therefore my friend we can continue to correspond on really important items such as the red sox golf the patriots or the state of our mutual health but i am wiping my favorites clean of political blogs national publications and candidate web sites it is over i have been played for the fool all too long tommyo

4568457 this modern version of an ancient tradition is really something
4568458 this change gives people great hope of leaving behind the poverty and corruption that has characterized the government for so many years

4568463 is looking for people who are qualified but also honest and many of them are catholics or christians
4568464 we cant put all the responsibility on the government the challenge is to seek consensus among people to address these problems
4568465 five years are very little to address the challenges that face us as a country
4568466 no one questions the importance of turning these expectations into action eliminating errors and negative practices from politics and urgently adopting measures that will put the common good above personal family group and partisan interests
4568467 the catholic church does not identify with the new government
4568468 cannot neglect pastoral work to enter the field of politics
4568469 any policy for the common good which promotes human dignity and rights and which seeks the integral development of the people and their communities

4568497 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4568498 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4568499 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4568500 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4568501 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4568502 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4568503 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4568504 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4568505 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4568506 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4568507 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4568508 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4568509 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4568510 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4568511 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4568512 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4568513 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4568514 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4568515 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4568516 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4568517 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4568518 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4568519 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4568523 we have a great relationship and theres no telling what will happen moving forward
4568524 theres no negative energy there now everybody feels positive we all feel connected
4568525 it feels really good in this economic climate for me as not only an artist but as a businessman to be able to present something to america that i know will make things a little easier for people
4568526 to show how committed i was and how much i believe in the clothes
4568527 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
4568528 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
4568529 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
4568530 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
4568531 as far as we are concerned we let off the fireworks thats whats important to us
4568532 biscardi has been a full time professional bigfoot hunter for at least three years
4568533 biscardi has been a full time professional bigfoot hunter for at least three years
4568534 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4568535 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4568536 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4568537 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4568538 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4568539 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4568540 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4568541 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4568542 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4568543 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4568544 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4568545 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4568546 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4568547 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4568548 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4568549 not behaving like the kind of international partner that it has said it wants to be
4568550 would not send american military forces into a conflict in georgia
4568551 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4568552 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4568553 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4568554 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4568555 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4568556 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4568557 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4568558 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4568559 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4568560 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4568561 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4568562 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4568563 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4568564 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4568565 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4568566 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4568567 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4568568 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4568569 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4568570 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4568571 this is a planning took where all things are going
4568572 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4568573 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4568574 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4568575 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4568576 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4568577 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4568578 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4568579 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4568580 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4568586 americans have suffered from the disturbingly high costs of gasoline and other sources of energy for too long clearly there is not a single quick fix solution that will help americans see a measurable difference in their transportation and home energy expenses thats why i believe it is important for the public to hear more about alternative forms of energy and ways to better utilize our existing domestic resources im proud that the energy summit was able to serve as an opportunity for many interested individuals to learn more about oklahomas fuel and energy landscape
4568587 its something that will take considerable investment well have to build a new transmission grid the great thing about the wind corridor is we have it the bad thing is there is not very many people living in it it will generate a lot more power than you can use in the area so weve got to have a means to transmit that
4568588 its not just the power you get its the jobs that go with it which pickens talks about a lot
4568589 the building of the wind farms the building of the transmission lines theres a lot of domestic employment involved in developing this system and maintaining it
4568590 you can bring something to the floor that will have something called under suspension which means it takes two thirds to pass if shed have brought it to the floor and allowed republicans to offer amendments that bill would have passed
4568591 the amendments the republicans wanted to offer were things like off shore exploration and production
4568592 she cant have it both ways the majority of the congress voted for that bill so how is it our fault that it failed when she gets the majority of the votes and she gets to decide whether or not it comes in an amenable fashion
4568593 what drives speculation is when supply and demand are just about the same so any little thing shakes up the market
4568594 at the end of the day if youre not increasing production theres no way youre going stop speculation while i think there could be a lot of republican support and there has been on some ends of the speculation its going to come under two conditions going forward
4568595 they dont have to vote for them they dont have to pass them just let us have our crack at the debate
4568596 you kill speculation if you have an abundance of supply period
4568597 the idea that americans could drive 40 billion miles less which weve done in the past eight months and immediately cause a collapse in global energy prices is just unthinkable
4568598 if you cant control the demand side and we at least deal with the supply side and help put more supply on the market thatll kill speculation faster than anything else
4568599 part of what we must do to bring down the price of energy to the american people is to increase domestic supply
4568600 and increasing domestic supply means that we must remove all doubt in the minds of those who wish to drill and those who want the drilling to take place that there are 68 million acres in the lower 48 states where drilling is allowed
4568601 its the dumbest bill in the world thats what an oil lease is
4568602 men vi h ller oss p stenen och det r faktiskt
4568603 i got off to such a good start and birdied the first three holes
4568604 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4568605 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4568606 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4568607 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4568608 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4568609 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4568610 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4568611 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4568612 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4568613 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4568614 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4568615 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4568616 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4568617 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4568618 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4568619 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4568620 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4568621 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4568622 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4568623 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4568624 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4568625 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4568626 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4568627 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4568628 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4568629 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4568630 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4568631 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4568632 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4568633 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4568634 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4568635 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4568636 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4568648 weve got a lot of pride and we took a shot to it if i can be blunt
4568649 a lot of people both in the throwing world and outside the throwing world have come down on christian for not performing at the level that we expect him to perform
4568650 the reality is hes a huge man and a very powerful man and when he lines everything up it goes really far we expect it all the time he has dealt with this pressure for a long time

4568673 the fact that we have gotten this far and the fact that we came so close to a victory should send a message to all school boards in the country that if you are banning things based on the fact that it is offensive that violates the constitution

4568677 obama always acknowledged his stepfather was muslim though he did his best to downplay islam as an important force in his stepfathers life
4568678 the grandparents who helped raise mr obama were nonpracticing baptists and methodists his mother was an anthropologist who collected religious texts the way others picked up tribal masks teaching her children the inspirational power of the common narratives and heroes his mothers tutelage took place mostly in indonesia in the household of mr obamas stepfather lolo soetoro a nominal muslim who hung prayer beads over his bed but enjoyed bacon which islam forbids
4568679 considered by many to be the grandfather of what has come to be known as the 9 11 truth movement
4568680 obama got islamic instruction and it wasnt mainstream islamic instruction
4568681 we should not have anybody as president who both their parents arent americans
4568682 he is a ringer folks hes meant to take a dive for john mccain so this is nonpartisan the facts are in he will be destroyed in this election
4568683 considered by many to be the grandfather of what has come to be known as the 9 11 truth movement
4568684 obama got islamic instruction and it wasnt mainstream islamic instruction
4568685 we should not have anybody as president who both their parents arent americans
4568686 he is a ringer folks hes meant to take a dive for john mccain so this is nonpartisan the facts are in he will be destroyed in this election
4568687 discuss ed the findings of steven jones physicist and hero of the 9 11 truth movement who claims to have evidence that the world trade center towers collapsed due to explosives inside the building not just the planes hitting them during the attacks
4568688 a forum for those who take a deeply skeptical view of government claims about the attacks
4568689 book about senator barack obama appears to have distracted him from another project he was planning in january exposing what he calls the governments inadequate explanations about the 9 11 attacks on the world trade center
4568690 the fire from jet fuel does not burn hot enough to produce the physical evidence that hes produced
4568691 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust
4568692 small business administration from implementing a proposed rule that would limit the use of sole source contracts for women owned small businesses to only four industries
4568693 its understandable that newly confirmed leaders want to review the commands way forward
4568694 however they should be clear that cyber capabilities remain a top priority for the military
4568695 the new cyber command is important symbolically as well because creating a virtual command with offensive and defensive capabilities is essential to prevail in modern warfare
4568696 the command also codifies the beginning of a professional career path for airmen and women and the associated training and doctrine that must be established
4568697 we do understand that senior leadership is taking a look at this but we have not been told to halt just yet
4568698 weve got new leaders in the chief of staff and the secretary of the air force and theyre looking at all the issues of the air force
4568699 they will be looking at cyberspace and the cyber command capabilities and try to determine the best way forward with that as of this point in time today we have not officially been told to put anything on hold
4568700 the recent russia georgia war proves that policy makers need to systematically

4568709 i think carlos cuellar was a fantastic player for rangers
4568710 he was only there for last season and obviously he wants to get into the spanish national team and you cant deny playing in the premier league is going to give him a better opportunity of that
4568711 i think from rangers perspective they brought him in for just over 2 million and sold him for 8m thats a good bit of business but obviously the supporters dont see it like that and they are bitterly disappointed to have lost one of their better players
4568712 i think definitely its important for me to get out and play football
4568713 there are great fans here the coaching staff have been superb and everyone has made me welcome
4568714 at the end of the day to have european football on your cv something that you want so its definitely something i will look into
4568715 he gives us experience we dont have a lot of experience in the forward line he holds the ball up well runs the channels and his link up play is pretty decent as well
4568716 i got a bit of info on him and everyone said he was very hard but fair and i think that is all you can really ask for out of a manager
4568717 hes passionate he was like that as a player and hes got belief in me and that is somebody i want to work with
4568718 at the end of the day i want to score goals but i want to do well for myself which is important as a player
4568719 but i want to keep getting into the international sides and as soon as i heard that dundee united were interested it was a no brainer for me
4568720 i got signed from dundee united to play right back but when the manager asked me to play left back when i first came in i said it was no problem and i felt quite comfortable there
4568721 i went a long period without playing there but the last few pre season games i played a few games at left back but its just the more games you play the more comfortable you get
4568722 i think its still up for grabs andreas came in at a time when i was injured and i was just coming back and the manager had no other options but to sign a right back
4568723 i feel now that the seasons started weve started afresh and its whoever has played better or performed better in training that catches the managers eye that is going to play

4568730 its a challenge to us to reach the level we did in auckland and surpass it thats what great teams do they consistently reach that level
4568731 there are a lot of doubters around who doubt the team has the heart to do it again but thats the challenge to take that level and intensity off shore and put it on the field at newlands
4568732 you cant do it for them you can draw on your own experiences and tell them what it will be like and you can try to recreate situations at training we trust these boys that they will put it all out on the park this saturday
4568733 weve had a good week done a lot of homework worked hard and the players are now preparing themselves mentally to be where they need to be
4568734 whatever they do is up to them but they have the responsibility to get there
4568735 the biggest challenge is sunday monday tuesday and the amount of preparation work
4568736 they are important days for getting the strategy right to get it across well to not overload the players
4568737 thats the biggest challenge weekly getting those days right and setting it up so the players can enter this period in the right space so they can get it right and unleash at newlands
4568738 in the past we took into account that players needed a break and weve always had a large pool of players who could all perform at a very high level
4568739 it was easy to make changes under those conditions but this team has had a weeks break so it was great that we could pick the same team
4568740 i know theres been a change in the coaching style and the up front nature that he de villiers has
4568741 whether thats one of his strategies to try to create an attitude that we the all blacks are not as good as people think im not too sure
4568742 they have always been massive contests and there have never been any easy ones

4568796 the campaign for the online archive was mounted by conservative publications and politicians who said that the nations spy agencies had failed adequately to analyze the 48 000 boxes of documents seized since the march 2003 invasion with the public increasingly skeptical about the rationale and conduct of the war the chairmen of the house and senate intelligence committees argued that wide analysis and translation of the documents most of them in arabic would reinvigorate the search for clues that mr hussein had resumed his unconventional arms programs in the years before the invasion american search teams never found such evidence

4568822 he came with incredibly strong credentials and hes been able to use his own background to build the school of medicine in a very powerful way
4568823 you can only go back and ask and ask so many times
4568824 the funding stream for the university of arizona school of medicine is 65 million from the state
4568825 as soon as that call came out we started clearing units to go to it just down the road not too far away
4568826 the volunteers are people who have given countless hours over many years in many different schools and capacities this is truly the nature of volunteerism that we honor this year with the slate of volunteers
4568827 likewise our retired educators are just exemplary individuals who come recommended not only by students in the district but also by their peers as being very influential mentors and role models and its always easy to talk about our outstanding alumni because they have very notable accomplishments within their fields of endeavor
4568828 we want people to come be entertained then go home feeling really great about the public schools in columbia because they are great
4568829 singh 26 was one of the quickest drivers in the formula ford last season though he was driving an old car on a very limited budget
4568830 last season jayant singh had a miserable time under resourced and running at the back of the field
4568831 this season he has found more support bought new tyres for the first time quit his job to concentrate on racing and after two rounds and consistently good placings he stands fifth on points

4568835 i dont do it for basketball games and i dont run out there unless theres a football game so i have not asked the question because im afraid of the answer
4568836 im not aware of anyone who would want to do it

4568840 peter has selected a very strong team and the springboks have more experience than the all blacks
4568841 south africas skyscrapers in the line out will be of great importance victor matfield andries bekker juan smith and pierre spies will make it hard for new zealand to win line out ball
4568842 the springboks realise their chances of winning the tri nations depend on the result of this match they would have gained much confidence from their victory in dunedin
4568843 what more can i say than it is wonderful to play in 100 test matches
4568844 six springbok coaches selected percy and that says a lot he is a wonderful role model and he looks after himself well
4568845 it was always great to have players such as percy and os du randt percys passion and loyalty to the springbok values are very strong he is serious about the traditions of springbok rugby
4568846 what makes him so remarkable is that he is willing to share his knowledge with anyone he does not keep anything to himself
4568847 even when he is not playing he remains the same person and personality i am blessed to be working with someone like percy this is a great week for him
4568848 theres always a lot of kicking in a test against the all blacks whatever the conditions its always a big tactical battle
4568849 the all blacks changed their tactics against australia with jimmy cowan coming in at scrum half and they kicked a lot more
4568850 jimmy and i are the same age and weve been playing against each other since under 19 days so i know what to expect from him
4568851 we will miss bakkies botha because he is a special player but it is a big advantage that every forward can jump in the line out
4568852 it means the all blacks wont be able to kick the ball out theyll have to kick down the middle
4568853 it definitely makes it very difficult for them if they cant kick the ball out and it will be tough for them if they cant give their backs good ball from the set pieces
4568854 it will obviously be very tough on saturday because the all blacks will be out for revenge

4568884 gazing at mary assumed into heaven we understand better that our everyday lives although marked by problems and difficulties flow like a river toward the divine ocean toward the fullness of joy and peace
4568885 the sad spectacle of so much false joy and at the same time so much agonizing pain
4568886 this firm conviction of the church found its coronation in the dogmatic definition of the assumption pronounced by my venerable predecessor pius xii in the year 1950
4568887 from paradise the blessed mother continues always especially in difficult hours of trial to watch over her children whom jesus himself entrusted to her before dying on the cross
4568888 mary assumed into heaven indicates to us the ultimate aim of our earthly pilgrimage
4568889 she reminds us that our whole being spirit soul and body is destined for the fullness of life that one who lives and dies in love for god and for ones neighbor will be transfigured into the image of the glorious body of the risen lord that the lord casts down the mighty and raises up the humble

4568936 ignored the most destructive and widely prevailing racist attitude in our society today one of which both blacks and whites are guilty this is the attitude that blacks cannot be held to the same standards as whites
4568937 its a racism of diminished expectations a racism that says blacks still need special treatment in education and job placement that we cant give black parents freedom to choose where to send their kids to school that we cant let low income black workers build wealth through a personal retirement account instead of paying social security taxes because they wont know what to do

4568943 i now realize that those who disagree with me also have good points
4568944 for me it isnt just politics or theory it is the reality that my parents and grandparents faced and the reality that my students will face
4568945 we are not afraid to entrust the american people with unpleasant facts foreign ideas alien philosophies and competitive values for a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people
4568946 nobody wants to take away your french fries and hamburgers but if you can make them with something that is less damaging to your health we should do that
4568947 we dont think that a municipal health agency has any business banning a product the food and drug administration has already approved
4568948 most diseases today including heart disease cancer stroke and aids are partly if not significantly due to lifestyle and behavioral choices obesity is the end result of poor lifestyle and genetics in the same way that lung cancer or heart attacks can be the end result of smoking and genetics
4568949 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself
4568950 do you know what a soldier is young man hes the chap who makes it possible for civilized folk to despise war

4568957 murali and mendis together make it a top attack we will have to do very well to defeat sri lanka
4568958 this was also an international class attack the knock gave me a lot of confidence i had prepared well before coming here and i hope can continue this form
4568959 winning the match was very important because we were the favourites going into the game
4568960 theres always the motivation to score runs whether you miss out or you dont you always want to perform at your best i want to make sure this time when i go to sri lanka ill better my performances from last time
4568961 i prepared keeping in mind the conditions in sri lanka the targets of the team and its nice that i succeeded immediately in the practice match
4568962 the pitch was a little double paced the ball wasnt always coming on my intention was to spend time in the middle because i havent played for a while then i played my strokes
4568963 its important we play according to the conditions and not peoples expectations we never have a fixed batting line up the player best suited for a particular situation goes in the batting orders good so i am sure we are going to carry on with this

4568974 we cannot impose a military solution on what has effectively become a civil war and until we acknowledge that reality we can send 15 000 more troops 20 000 more troops 30 000 more troops i dont know any expert on the region or any military officer that ive spoken to privately that believes that that is going to make a substantial difference on the situation on the ground
4568975 i would submit there is nothing wrong with any of this
4568976 since the potency of arguments can often lie in their context kaplan provides transparent if unwitting justification for mainstream voters to be skeptical about obama by arguing that a visit from a sitting united states president just isnt what it used to be
4568977 began to go their own way pursue their own interests build their own alliances without giving much thought to washingtons feelings about the matter
4568978 either way not only was obamas remark not naive it reflected a more instinctive understanding of the post cold war world than either of his opponents seem to possess
4568979 it ought to mandate an already overdue rethinking by the
4568980 a loyal and unswerving friend of the right to life movement
4568981 from proliferating state level think tanks to massive organizations based in washington d c such as the heritage foundation and american enterprise institute the causes of limited government defending life and promoting free markets are hardly without champions and thanks to talk radio fox news and a general acceptance of conservatism as a legitimate viewpoint it has never been easier for conservatives to get their arguments to the public

4568983 but his insistence that he can bridge the nations ideological chasms without resort to partisan warfare leaves some with the nagging sense that he makes it sound too easy and that his full measure as a politician has yet to be taken
4568984 he favors moderate tastes preferring organic tea to a tumbler of gin salmon to steak a fruit plate to fries
4568985 can we return to the best values of that time yes but not if both houses of congress the presidency and the supreme court move the country even further leftward
4568986 it must be the policy of the to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures

4569056 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4569057 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4569058 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4569059 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year

4569069 the talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4569070 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4569071 we cannot continue wandering around without direction hence the need to swear in parliamentarians and open the house so that the elected members can continue to fulfil their constitutional mandate
4569072 the whole thing was going to be determined at this sadc summit
4569073 there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
4569074 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4569075 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe

4569124 thinking beyond the contemporary mantra of democracy elections and decentralization
4569125 a tension at the international level between promoting poverty reduction and promoting competitive multi party democracy
4569126 in many cases democracies produce governments which are very effective in reducing poverty witness recent experience in brazil for example
4569127 there are less democratic regimes which have been and are very effective in reducing poverty and the international community needs to recognise that part of this effectiveness may be due to the nature of the regime where a strong connection between regime and citizens has been forged through a popular movement which generates a social compact between elite and the poor as part of a national development project
4569128 china and vietnam would also be examples and there are others during the last 60 years the implication for the international community would be to exercise caution in attaching political conditionalities to aid or other international negotiations of course this does not mean that in extreme cases eg zimbabwe the international community should not take a strong political position
4569129 we need to talk about this especially after traumatic events autocracies may do nation building more effectively than elected governments there is more to politics than ballot counting
4569130 shoring up fragile states should be as important to donors as tackling climate change

4569136 our additional concern with lethal injection is that unskilled people should not attempt it
4569137 this is acceptable to us provided ebb is willing to pay tracs a stipend for every rabbit turned over to our group we feel that it is not right for the company to pocket 54 k for the year for capturing the rabbits when in fact we would pay for sterilization pen building and maintenance
4569138 we are willing to negotiate with ebb and hopefully they will offer to pay for the service of caring for the caught rabbits these are rabbits that ebb will not have to deal with
4569139 certainly in the process of all the re zoning that council was undertaking we were trying to be mindful of what the intent of the original covenant upheld the covenant which sets out three distinct parts the land must never be sold must be used for municipal purposes and must not to be used for commercial or industrial purposes
4569140 the goal of this and previous councils is to preserve continuous public access to okanagan lake from city park to knox mountain park
4569141 you can put municipal buildings on it but you cant put commercial or industrial buildings on the land when we tried to remove the covenant the save the simpson society covenant tried to put a stop to it and thats why it ended up in the courts it has implications for future changes in zoning and use of the land if this ruling overrides the caveat that no commercial activity is allowed on the property than what implications will this have for stuart park for instance an example would be could a hotdog vendor for example not set up shop in that park

4569151 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4569152 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4569153 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4569154 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4569155 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory

4569158 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside

4569210 the new wave in business is forget corporate social responsibility and philanthropy how do you integrate this into your core business
4569211 the idea danone has of creating a social dividend for shareholders thats cutting edge no one else has come up with this interesting a model it supports your brand returns your capital youre not going to lose money and you give your shareholders a vision of doing something good
4569212 this is the kind of thing that can change the mentality within business even if it replaces corporate giving money given for philanthropy is often misused
4569213 people say dont be stupid i say there are a lot of stupid people like me i dont want to make money lots of young people dont want to make money because their mother their father made so much money they dont know what to do with their lives there are many such kids in the u s they dont have any challenge left give them the challenge fix the world create a social business enterprise

4569235 you catch wild pigs by finding a suitable place in the woods and putting corn on the ground the pigs find it and begin to come everyday to eat the free corn when they are used to coming every day you put a fence down on one side of the place where they are used to coming when they get used to the fence they begin to eat the corn again and you put up another side of the fence they get used to that and start to eat again you continue until you have all four sides of the fence up with a gate in the last side the pigs which are used to the free corn start to come through the gate to eat that free corn again you then slam the gate on them and catch the whole herd suddenly the wild pigs have lost their freedom they run around and around inside the fence but they are caught soon they go back to eating the free corn they are so used to it that they have forgotten how to forage in the woods for themselves so they accept their captivity

4569240 conduct raised suspicion on his being involved in stealing the car
4569241 in normal circumstances no government employee would commit such an act at the cost of his service there appears to be apparent carelessness on the part of the petitioner in leaving the keys inside the car but the concerned investigating officer io in his over zealousness implicated him as an easy target
4569242 it seems the io has not taken due care even to look at the previous firs complaining about similar thefts taken place in the same vicinity nor he bothered to verify the antecedents of the complainant

4569280 science although an important part of policy debates remains but one element and often a minor one in the decision making process we scientists can assess the ecological consequences of various policy options but in the end it is up to society to prioritize those options and make their choices accordingly

4569305 the job security is good because we continue to grow as a county we know were going to gain thousands more students this year

4569307 government doesnt understand technology and has no interest in using it that way
4569308 the campaigns havent really achieved anything of significance so there isnt a model to transfer over to the operation of government anyway
4569309 it assumes that everybody who signs up for the e mail list is a supporter and in a closely contested race that people arent looking for reinforcement of why they should vote
4569310 campaigns do themselves a disservice by thinking that e mail in particular is not going to fall into somebodys inbox who needs more than just a reminder to find their polling place
4569311 reflects the way the internet is affecting pretty much everything about the news business
4569312 faced with declining advertising revenues and competition from the web midsize regional dailies across the country have been retrenching in recent years to focus on local news that has scaled back their washington coverage and their national ambitions
4569313 the politico is planning its own regular half hour program on allbrittons 24 hour cable news service channel 8 which reaches 1 1 million viewers in the region its reporters are to appear on cbs news programs and the politico is planning a five minute daily segment in the late afternoon on wtop washingtons all news radio station

4569316 in our dreams people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands the present educational conventions fade from our minds and unhampered by tradition we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive folk we shall not try to make these people or any of their children philosophers or men of learning or men of science we have not to raise up form among them authors educators poets or men of letters we shall not search for embryo great artists painters musicians nor lawyers doctors preachers politicians statesmen of whom we have ample supply the task we set before ourselves is very simple we will organize children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way
4569317 at a time when our entire country is banding together and facing down individualism the patriots set a wonderful example showing us all what is possible when we work together believe in each other and sacrifice for the greater good
4569318 it is thus necessary that the individual should come to realize that his own ego is of no importance in comparison with the existence of his nation that the position of the individual ego is conditioned solely by the interests of the nation as a whole that above all the unity of a nations spirit and will are worth far more than the freedom of the spirit and will of an individual this state of mind which subordinates the interests of the ego to the conservation of the community is really the first premise for every human culture we understand only the individuals capacity to make sacrifices for the community for his fellow man
4569319 all our lives we fought against exalting the individual against the elevation of the single person and long ago we were over and done with the business of being a hero and here it comes up again the glorification of one personality this is not good at all
4569320 the seriousness of these findings and their enormous significance to our national security
4569321 ballistic missiles armed with wmd payloads pose an immediate strategic threat to the us
4569322 no threat from long range ballistic missiles for at least 15 years
4569323 the threat to the us posed by these emerging capabilities is broader more mature and evolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the clinton administrations intelligence community
4569324 consistent with the war powers resolution about 6 200 us military personnel continue to participate in the nato led sfor operation in bosnia and another 2 200 troops will support sfor from other parts of the region
4569325 consistent with the war powers resolution 8 000 us troops will continue to serve as part of the nato led kfor security force in kosovo while another 1 500 us troops are deployed in other parts of the region in support roles
4569326 yet look at how this war happened there is a case for getting tough with iraq bear in mind that an exasperated clinton administration considered a bombing campaign in 1998 but its not a case that the bush administration ever made instead we got assertions about a nuclear program that turned out to be based on flawed or faked evidence we got assertions about a link to al qaeda that people inside the intelligence services regard as nonsense
4569327 victory in iraq wont end the worlds distrust of the united states because the bush administration has made it clear over and over again that it doesnt play by the rules remember this administration told europe to take a hike on global warming told russia to take a hike on missile defense told developing countries to take a hike on trade in lifesaving pharmaceuticals told mexico to take a hike on immigration mortally insulted the turks and pulled out of the international criminal court all in just two years
4569328 won lifes lottery get their news from cable and talk radio this segment is very divided they generally approve of the war in iraq and generally support bush

4569341 and i hope you know i cleared away any of those bad little memories for him i hope that this definitely tops it i have a few more to go but it is an amazing accomplishment just to be here with him out on the floor 20 years after he competed i think it just means so much more to both of us i dont know just all the hard work paying off all the injuries tears blood rips everything

4569356 and on his watch our military was deployed more often than during any other presidency in history not to fight actual wars but to manage poorly planned and unclear peacekeeping missions with unclear rules of engagement in places like somalia haiti rwanda colombia cambodia bosnia and kosovo all resulting in little if anything gained in terms of democracy and the development of civil societies in these countries

4569361 t heyre the only ones who gain from this i really think theyre trying to ignite pakistan into the kind of chaos they need to survive
4569362 almost certainly the work of al qaeda or al qaedas pakistani allies their objective is to destabilize the pakistani state to break up the secular political parties to break up the army so that pakistan becomes a politically failing state in which the islamists in time can come to power much as they have in other failing states
4569363 we have terminated the most precious american asset which vowed to defeat the mujahedin
4569364 after further review discussion argument and conclusion skitzo calypso will be returning to sellaband today in hopes of producing a 50k record a lot of our investors were sorry to see us go well were back
4569365 we have decided this issue is touchy because there are parties interested in an exclusive skitzo calypso release and interests invested in an exclusive niki thunders release
4569366 its difficult to really say when emotions take over and youre on tilt sometimes you go all in on a pair of jacks the flop comes and its an a k q the 10 never comes as to say we were moving very quickly similar to ees ellie etc but we never took the time to read the fine print and straight en out the logistics i suppose it would have been logical to read the contract before jumping ship but certain members within the band didnt want to get tied into an agreement while we were still promoting our record between the lines amp beyond the static our manager wasnt comfortable with the contractual aspects of sellaband and suggested we take a closer look regardless of the variables i was interested in the concept and spent my time looking into it i decided to sign up as a solo artist in the event i hit 50k as niki thunders i would produce a record i always wanted to produce and no one the band members or other interested parties would be legally emotionally mentally or physically involved with something they werent 100 behind i am the primary songwriter of both projects which isnt to say that the members of skitzo calypso dont contribute significantly to the process but i knew niki was something i could give them independently as a solo artist
4569367 its simple really johan we drove to new york recently and had a meet and greet with a handful of sellaband artists investor s bryan skitzo calypso guitarist and i spoke exclusively with johan for about an hour prior we asked some tough questions as did he he laid a lot of my misconceptions fears that many artists likely feel upon registering for an account to rest once over the mental hurdles i mentioned the band was heading back to the studio to record a follow up to between the lines johan recommended bringing skitzo calypso back on board my initial qualm was that the investors would be scared off by the further confusion evoked by this project which is why we have to honor our believers by providing them with skitzo calypso and niki thunders music i also think the people investors want something definitive a band skitzo calypso the band has an extremely large catalog and an established band to tour and sell records with we are a smart investment as a unit
4569368 its sellabands concept the community the family aspect of it and my awareness of the music industry it isnt the same animal we dreamed about as kids we want to make our music i am not interested in what is happening on commercial radio it really isnt the industries fault they arent in a position to take chances on bands that arent cooked up in a lab by a bunch of a amp r suits in response to another labels new cash cow band i strongly believe skitzo calypso is relevant and belongs in the forefront yes there is a difference between arrogance and confidence confidence comes from awareness and awareness comes from experience arrogance comes from impulse evoked by the ego i want to help put sellaband on the map because it will put us on the larger map the believers are going to decide the next generation of music and its going to cost money and take risk but you cant make a souffl without breaking a few eggs can you
4569369 the band is behind the decision which is part of the reason the niki account was established in the first place to hold the reigns i had to make sure everyone was on board which is why i brought one of the guitarists to new york with me to meet johan a lot was accomplished simple as that
4569370 our immediate plans are to announce our decision as i told johan it is incredibly important for bands to be able to tour in order to sell records itll be a one step at a time process it would be difficult without a crystal ball to anticipate what our investors should expect without sounding pretentious or overly ambitious we will give our believers the next skitzo calypso record and the next niki thunders ep its important that the believers are comfortable and understand that they are getting niki thunders and skitzo calypso with anything what are you selling i think weve sweetened the deal and i believe the investors will be more than receptive

4569381 i saw a teenager who was mentally ill being raped by the other prisoners
4569382 and whats worse a police officer filmed the entire scene with his cellular phone
4569383 she was raped from day one at the jail in para state a children and adolescent defence centre cedeca spokeswoman said
4569384 she was raped innumerable times and forced to exchange sexual relations for food said miere cohen the president of the order of brazilian lawyers human rights commission
4569385 nobody really knows what she was charged with she was a suspect in a robbery but police were unable to tell us which robbery there was no formal charge ms cohen said
4569386 whether she was 15 20 50 80 or 100 doesnt matter a woman should not have been kept in a jail cell with men para governor ana julia carepa said
4569387 is distraught and very afraid but said shes able to recognise the police officers who locked her up and the detainees who raped her shes ready to talk
4569388 last week i assisted with a cat who was found lying listlessly on the side of a busy highway upon spotting her a good samaritan pulled over assuming the cat had been hit by a car the poor cat just barely lifted her head to greet her rescuer meowing piteously and seeming unable to walk she was obviously in great distress when her rescuer picked her up he noticed that her legs chest and face were covered in blood he rushed her to a nearby shelter and after careful examination the shelter veterinarian announced that the cat was in perfect health expect that she had recently been declawed well never know the whole story but it seems this poor mutilated creature was so emotionally amp physically wounded that she attempted to run away from the trauma and ended up so disoriented and anguished that she just collapsed
4569389 i had my kitten declawed at the same time she was spayed i have to admit i will never do it again to any kitty that i own the poor thing growls and hisses at all the other cats she bites when they try and play with her and she also bites me i really think having her declawed caused her to have some real issues with defending herself
4569390 i had my male cat tiny tim declawed this tuesday morning i was supposed to pick him up on wednesday but they called and wanted to keep him another day because he was still bleeding early this morning i received a message from the vet saying that i needed to call her right away because they still could not stop the bleeding in one of his paws today we rushed him up to another animal hospital at the vets recommendation i asked if he had a better chance to live and she immediately said yes they still cannot control the bleeding he received a blood transfusion today and they re packed his paw three times today and re sutured it he later had no brain activity and died the reason im writing is because ive never heard of a cat dying from a declaw i just cant chalk this up to one of those things

4569392 gayface the gay minstrel and performing homosexuality in contemporary american media
4569393 he is gay like most devastatingly handsome single men his age are
4569394 just knowing the fab five makes it that much more difficult to dismiss gay people as threatening the american way of life after all their entire mission is to make straight america feel better about itself when it looks in the mirror
4569395 apparently having five gay men restyle your wardrobe and decorate your house is appropriate but having gay men flirt with each other is not
4569396 so does that mean you can have a girls day out with me
4569397 it is tempting to accept visibility as a sign of social progress

4569404 but we also want to remember how special these kids were and to celebrate their short lives i like hearing stories about tim and his crazy antics
4569405 he wasnt sure of what to do in music but he wanted to eventually be a rock star
4569406 tim was unforgettable he was very outgoing and made most people feel like they were his best friend he was a good listener and often helped other people
4569407 he brought adventure and fun to the lives of those who knew him
4569408 cory could be very quiet then other times he could be very silly the kids talk about the crazy things he used to do

4569430 last nights debate on univision reminds us why a democrat in the white house would turn back the gains hispanics have made in recent years none of the democrats presented an agenda thats in sync with the best interests of this nations hispanic population
4569431 whether the issue is keeping taxes low and the economy strong assuring the nations security or upholding the traditional family values most of us cherish all the democratic candidates fail hispanic voters
4569432 as these differences with the democrats become clearer to more hispanics im convinced that more of our voters will embrace the agenda of republicanism which emphasizes economic prosperity strong national defense respect for traditional family values and opportunity for all americans

4569468 a king rules without injustice a land of truthfulness until god leads us to a way out of our difficulty
4569469 o king we were in a state of ignorance and immorality worshipping idols eating carrion committing all sorts of iniquity we honored no relative and assisted no neighbor the strong among us exploited the weak then god sent us a prophet one of our own people whose lineage truthfulness loyalty and purity were well known to us he called us to worship god alone and to repudiate all the stones and idols that we and our ancestors used to worship he commanded us always to tell the truth to remain true to trust and promise to assist the relative to be good neighbors to abstain from blood and things forbidden and to avoid fornication perjury and false witness he commanded us not to rob the wealth of the orphan or falsely to accuse the married woman he ordered us to worship god alone and never to associate any other being with him to hold prayers to fast and to pay the zakat the five pillars of islam were here enu merated and explained we believed in him and what he brought to us from god and followed him in what he enjoined and forbade our people however tried to sway us away from our religion and persecuted us and inflicted upon us great suffering that we might re enter into the immoral practices of old as they vanquished and berated us unjustly and made life intolerable for us in makkah we chose you and your country and came thither to live under your protection in justice and peace
4569470 will you show me some of the revelation which your prophet claims to have come to him from god
4569471 these words must have sprung from the same foun tainhead from which the words of our master jesus christ have sprung
4569472 what you have just recited and that which was revealed to moses must have both issued from the same source go forth into my kingdom i shall not extradite you at all
4569473 there is another side to the muslims new religion in which they judge jesus son of mary in totally different but condemnable terms
4569474 our judgment of jesus is exactly the same as that which was revealed to our prophet namely that jesus is the servant of god his prophet his spirit his command given unto mary the innocent virgin
4569475 between your religion and ours there is really no more difference than this line
4569476 by god you have deceived yourself o umar do you think that banu abd manaf would let you run around alive once you had killed their son muhammad why dont you return to your own house and at least set it straight

4569511 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
4569512 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
4569513 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
4569514 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
4569515 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
4569516 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4569517 we have a great relationship and theres no telling what will happen moving forward
4569518 theres no negative energy there now everybody feels positive we all feel connected

4569528 i would like to go in and meet with president hillary clinton
4569529 sir as i said yesterday mrs clinton is not president and doesnt reside here
4569530 i would like to go in and meet with president hillary clinton
4569531 sir this is the third day in a row you have been here asking to speak to mrs clinton ive told you already several times that mrs clinton is not the president and doesnt reside here dont you understand
4569532 oh i understand you fine i just love hearing your answer

4569534 mr richard c reid hearken now to the sentence the court imposes upon you
4569535 overwhelmingly focused on democrats and they are actively promoting the democrats liberal agenda
4569536 the top democratic candidates received much more favorable coverage than their gop counterparts with sen
4569537 was portrayed as a loser because of his support for staying the course in iraq
4569538 m uch of mccains coverage has emphasized the sinking nature of his campaign declining poll ratings and fundraising that has failed to meet expectations
4569539 is for the networks to cover the campaign in a fair and balanced manner
4569540 theoretically possible that the democrats have made 80 percent more news this year i would argue that the media have helped make all three democratic frontrunners into something akin to celebrities and then use their quasi celebrity status to justify more coverage
4569541 the democrats have had their share of stumbles and gaffes some of those have been reported and some have been downplayed but the network storyline on all the democratic frontrunners is mainly positive
4569542 could be getting the same deathwatch coverage that mccains been getting but instead he got a huge gift of a town hall meeting on abc something no republican has received
4569543 that doesnt mean mccains problems should be buried but it does show the networks seem to have a different approach for candidates of different parties
4569544 its like the networks tried to throw edwards a life preserver but dropped an anvil on mccain
4569545 just think about it homosexuals lesbians disgusting people marching in our streets demanding all sorts of things including the right to marry each other and the right to adopt children how do you like them apples
4569546 its their deliberate disgusting revolting conduct that is responsible for the disease
4569547 you needed that job and you were the best qualified but they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota is that really fair harvey gantt says it is
4569548 they should ask their parents if it would be all right for their son or daughter to marry a negro
4569549 ive been portrayed as a caveman by some thats not true im a conservative progressive and that means i think all men are equal be they slants beaners or niggers

4569555 remember when you tried that rice with aunt emily and the time you ate an egg on toast with daddy
4569556 what this does is it provides us better capability increased competencies more experience and greater knowledge to do the things that we are already doing today
4569557 theyre going to be able to bring back an esprit de corps that you learn within the seal community we dont always have that
4569558 we have a great service im very proud to wear the blue but the esprit de corps that comes out of the folks that go to buds and members of seal teams those experiences that knowledge that mindset are all things that are going to benefit the coast guard in the long term
4569559 what that means to us is approximately two seal platoons
4569560 this just adds a greater base of qualified candidates that dont come from recruits in the navy or from the fleet its a win win for everyone
4569561 valuable skills and knowledge to support the dod and increase the coast guards capabilities in our ports waterways and coastal security mission specifically counter terrorism and anti terrorism operations
4569562 when you look at the way the coast guards evolving bringing in that type of mentality and culture and understanding of the operations is going to be great for our organization
4569563 we discussed what it means to be a teenager in todays world
4569564 on my wedding day hell give it to my husband

4569566 but it means you make a promise to your dad to be a virgin until you are married and not have a lot of boyfriends

4569583 will a closed registry lead to genetic genocide for certain dog breeds
4569584 dog breeds are required to conform to a breed standard the pursuit of which often involves intensive inbreeding this has adverse consequences in terms
4569585 many diseases affecting dogs have high prevalence in one or a few breeds such as addisons disease common in portuguese water dogs chase et al 2006 interstitial lung disease in west highland white terriers norris et al 2005 and dermoid sinus in ridgeback dogs salmon hillbertz et al 2007
4569586 we find extremely inbred dogs in each breed except the greyhound and estimate an inbreeding effective population size between 40 and 80 for all but two breeds for all but three breeds more than 90 of unique genetic variants are lost over six generations indicating a dramatic effect of breeding patterns on genetic diversity
4569587 popular sires defined here as gt 100 recorded offspring are evident in all breeds except greyhound golden retrievers have the largest proportion of popular sires 10 and conversely the lowest proportion 5 of male dogs that are sires highly prolific dams gt 40 offspring are concentrated in three breeds german shepherd golden retriever and labrador retriever most dams have just one litter recorded
4569588 dog registration rules have only been rigidly enforced for about 50 years prior to that occasional outcrossing was still possible

4569590 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4569591 and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4569592 purchase duct tape in the event of a chemical attack
4569593 tom ridges command center is symptomatic of the floundering war on terrorism
4569594 if tom ridge is on the ticket i will not be voting republican
4569595 i think hes one of the most outstanding brilliant and broadly experienced people i wish he were pro life i wish everybody was its sen mccains choice to make i hope that whoever he picks would be pro life
4569596 26 of the 2004 voters were self identified evangelicals and pro life catholics
4569597 youd see pennsylvania light up like a christmas tree if tom ridge was tapped as vice president
4569598 hes a superior candidate after 9 11 we had two people who kept our nation safe president bush and tom ridge he has proved his worth
4569599 tom ridge is a great guy who is working very hard and traveling all over the country for john mccain he should certainly be on the shortlist for vp if mccain wins
4569600 i think tom ridge would be an excellent choice i think toms background is broad enough so that thats just one issue among others he was a governor homeland security i think he could help from a political point of view quite a bit in pennsylvania which i think is its only my own analysis i think pennsylvania is the key state
4569601 his efforts have resulted in safer skies increased border and port security and enhanced measures to safeguard our critical infrastructure and the american public
4569602 in the fight against terrorism he has played a vital role in protecting the american people from a real and ongoing threat
4569603 tom ridge is a decent man and a fine public servant but unfortunately was not given the leeway or resources to tighten up homeland security in the way it should be done
4569604 tom ridge has provided strong and resolute leadership in the fight against terror during his service as americas first secretary of homeland security
4569605 weve always had nutritional experts who tell us about diets
4569606 actually the particular challenge we are having now too much food is quite new
4569607 throughout evolution selection was usually the other way around individuals were selected who could store energy when food was around so that they could survive when it wasnt
4569608 its just fascinating to me why would slowing down fat absorption change our energy metabolism
4569609 thats very counterintuitive because we used to think that one calorie equals one calorie fat is fat and once it gets in the body it should behave the same as any other calorie but it doesnt seem like thats the end of the story i think there may be many layers of complexity that were just figuring out
4569610 a lot of the emphasis of our work may be to look at variations in this gene
4569611 can those variations account for the differences we see in how obese people get on similar diets
4569612 in the past the main challenge of any public health field has been to create a simple message that people can remember such as dont eat fat and youll be lean
4569613 but people are not simple so lots of times we give out dietary guidelines that dont really make sense for certain people
4569614 there clearly are some genetic factors that are normally silent when youre lean but that interact with obesity to bring on diabetes and theyre much worse in certain groups of people
4569615 although we talk a lot about the diabetes epidemic in the united states and europe the diabetes epidemic that is anticipated in asia is going to be much worse
4569616 when i was growing up in africa i never saw many obese people now i do
4569617 so something must be changing and i think its lifestyle and diet
4569618 in africa when you buy a car or when you have a tv its a sign of prosperity and you would be proud but if you misuse that technology its going to turn around and affect your health
4569619 but well know there are a lot of drug companies working on scd
4569620 diabetes can be managed by diet exercise and of course by insulin but insulin is very expensive in developing countries
4569621 so someone may be diabetic but not really have access to insulin or individuals can become diabetic and they dont know it
4569622 were not saying that you shouldnt eat a high carbohydrate or a high fat diet
4569623 you can eat what you like if you enjoy it as long as youre able to have energy balance in the body the energy coming in has to be counteracted by the energy that is going out
4569624 when i started out i thought you just needed to tell people to exercise more and control their diet things that for me although im not perfect at them werent that difficult
4569625 but they are very difficult for well over half of our population two thirds probably
4569626 we want to tackle the issue of obesity not just from our viewpoints as individuals but as teams that can take a wider view
4569627 how can a small yaoi publisher survive even flourish in todays competitive bookselling marketplace
4569628 with the weather conditions there is already high energy demand going on
4569629 alg n d a en cualquier parte en cualquier lugar indefectiblemente te encontrar s a ti mismo y sa s lo sa puede ser la m s feliz o la m s amarga de tus horas

4569631 yet what is most remarkable about the present bout of
4569632 no geopolitical issue has absorbed more of my time than darfur
4569633 the challenge for the coming year is to work continuously with the sudanese government rebel movements representatives of civil society and regional leaders as well as the un security council and the international community to ensure the ultimate success of both the talks and the military mission
4569634 im not sure it makes it any clearer for voters

4569636 when i was a kid all i had was a bicycle and a place i wasnt supposed to go
4569637 our membership has skewed a lot younger than what we originally anticipated
4569638 kids became a lot bigger part it wasnt just retirees like most country clubs have done in the past
4569639 the kids would rather hang out here than get a baby sitter
4569640 my younger one who is 9 they were going to build a room on for her because she was there so much
4569641 i thought there was a good selection of things to do
4569642 the kids really never seem to get bored it was a little cold of a summer for a lot of lake swimming so i think the pool came in handy
4569643 thrown straight up in the air like a missile and came straight down

4569663 these grows are in a lot higher elevation than in the past where weve normally located marijuana
4569664 more than likely its one group that is rotating in and out of each one of these grows because they all have camps they all have bed areas they all have cooking areas and they usually have firearms
4569665 theres strong evidence that theyll go from one camp to the next
4569666 this is the first known marijuana grow site within a national park service site in washington and the first one in western washington

4569671 we really have to face the fact that mistakes are made in museums just as they are made anywhere else
4569672 museums are in the habit of hiding these things away
4569673 any museum in this country and most of the important museums in europe who have coptics have the bad along with good
4569674 whether its because weve paid for it or someone with a fancy degree said it was genuine once we make a decision everything that happens after that gets piled in one basket and that is to vindicate the decision
4569675 if someone has a glass eye you can tell that something isnt quite right and a work of art is not so different it has a kind of integrity

4569677 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me

4569692 the theory is that damage to the nerve due to ear infections somehow alters the perception of food so that the person is more likely to enjoy high fat and sweet food and possibly drink more alcoholic beverages

4569694 this might be only one small piece of a larger puzzle

4569745 the hammer is really just a stone with an attached handle

4569851 the tamil tigers are keeping them in harms way and the government is not doing enough to ensure they receive essential assistance
4569852 these measures seem designed in part to use civilians as a buffer against government forces a serious violation of international humanitarian law the tamil tigers have also engaged in forced recruitment
4569853 when i look at aidens friends and i see some of them married and have a family i would imagine that would have been the way aiden was
4569854 life would have been very different for all of us
4569855 it sort of brought it all back to the surface at the same time i had got on with my life i suppose i had to you see having older children but especially for the younger children
4569856 at the time you just couldnt sit about and feel sorry for yourself
4569857 numero 8 encontraran 3 dvds en donde los tres cuentan con im genes isos de las distribuciones que venimos tratando en nuestras ediciones y el segundo dvd contiene la instalable directamente de opensuse 11 dvd full
4569858 one thing is for sure we have to keep an eye on this
4569859 because its there because it could develop into something stronger and if it follows what the models are saying it will be in our vicinity over the weekend
4569860 several of our guidance models would like to make it a hurricane
4569861 as soon as we have a depression or a tropical storm the computer models will behave more accurately
4569862 anytime you have a disturbance like this one in the atlantic in august headed this way you have to monitor it very carefully
4569863 regardless of development heavy rains and gusty winds will occur over portions of the virgin islands puerto rico and hispaniola today and tonight
4569864 being in a guild like ours means you are in a tightly knit group of people it takes time to break into the inner core but once youre in youre in
4569865 you get somebody who is used to going through security very quickly and knows exactly what they need to do they tend to kind of push people when they get into line and this tones down the anxiety for the less experienced traveler
4569866 going into this we knew there would be only one champion
4569867 we have both wanted it so bad that weve pushed each other so much and i think that we became a better and a stronger gymnast because of each other
4569868 i think if it had just been one of us there wouldnt be someone chasing your tail and wanting to make you work even harder
4569869 of course we knew one would win and one would be second
4569870 that is the feeling i have been looking for and it feels very good
4569871 anyone who knows me knows in the all around i once had a failure in the very first apparatus and then did well to catch up i also have done very well for the first five events then failed in the last
4569872 i prepared for any difficulties and expect any difficulties i will never give up
4569873 we went through processing and we got a home depot shopping cart size amount of usa clothing from ralph lauren its awesome
4569874 it is a dream its the whole reason i started cycling again and took a leave of absence from college and then the whole reason i went with slipstream because jv wanted to start a track squad that went with the road stuff
4569875 i dropped out of university after being there for 3 5 years near a degree and it was a big gamble you never know if you are going to make it so that is another aspect and just being away from home and normal things like having a girlfriend is impossible because you are being so selfish to yourself by following a training routine the lifestyle living for that moment and just training and training for it
4569876 i dont know how a 3km sprint means you can ride a madison or points race we might as well had a beer chugging contest whoever can down three beers and run around in a circle with an egg on a spoon
4569877 they seem kinda small now but if i did not make the team it would have been devastating i would have been a wreck i really dont know if i would have handled it right
4569878 there is a lot of family strife that comes into play in this one my cycling has always divided my family a lot i was always gone i can remember some large family arguments both extended and immediate family about it but for this to come full circle they can share in this and see that all the hardship we went through as a family has paid off this is bringing the whole family together my parents are divorced and never wanted to go to the same races but this is bringing everyone together and i really like that
4569879 my mother and father are both coming over to watch the games neither of them have ever been out of the country so i am honoured and excited for them because they get to travel and see something they never have before and they are going to see a madison event at the olympic level the only other time they might have seen one was when i was an amateur racing in t town
4569880 the coolest part about this is that any person who has helped me along the way or been a part of this in any way shape or form mentally with a positive word or financially this is for them they can be part of it not being there but knowing someone who is there this is for them
4569881 it was a really weird trials brad is my best friend he is the only guy other than my father and brother that i can say i love you on the phone danny pate thinks brad and i are like starsky and hutch driving our old mustangs
4569882 for brad it really hurt and i wish he was here maybe in 2012 hell be there even still he rode a hell of a trials only one second off and made the standard bobby had five months of training for that specific three kilometres while brad had a couple weeks and i just came back from europe i dont know how a 3km sprint means you can ride a madison or points race we might as well had a beer chugging contest whoever can down three beers and run around in a circle with an egg on a spoon
4569883 i thought there was going to be animosity but the four of us going to the trials all knew there were only going to be two of us going to the olympics we all worked towards making it happen and we are the first madison team to go to the olympics for the us and we all had a part in that we all qualified with points somewhere along the way to make it happen for that we are all connected now we have all moved on and the bottom line is that we are all on the same team
4569884 its not about me experiencing this so much as it is going there and doing the best i can and hopefully bringing back a medal
4569885 honestly i would not be going to the games if i didnt think i had a chance to medal
4569886 sure you go for the experience but im 27 and dont want to waste my time i really think we have a shot at it
4569887 the madison is a tactical race based on endurance speed tactics wit and technique you have 16 teams going full bore with hand exchanges that is 36 guys going crazy over 200 laps its a lot to handle
4569888 once we qualified for the team we immediately boarded a plane like two days later to go to a in italy we went to get some racing in on the track and work on hand exchanges it was really beneficial for that and because a lot of the guys racing in italy are the ones well be racing against in the games so it was good to see everybody we will be up against before italy i was coming off road training italy started off rough but by the end of the week i was cruising and exchanges were good
4569889 since returning from italy i spent the last month or so at altitude in colorado hitting the motor and doing some torque specific climbing as well as more than my fair share on the track with madison efforts its 50km long but really you are only racing for 25km because there are two guys racing so i would motor pace for 35km sprinting for ten laps it was pretty brutal
4569890 other than that i spent a lot of time up in the woods at 12 000 feet sleep high train low i went up there with danny pates dog kojak to sleep and come down in the morning it was great with colorados weather i should have grown a beard
4569891 im not nervous now like i was at worlds probably because i am much more prepared
4569892 its not a world championships it only comes once every four years it is so politically charged emotionally charged so many human characteristics involved and it is like becoming part of a new family some people work their entire lives for one shot and some are just not lucky there are athletes that are amazing and deserve to be here but for one reason or another at trials they just werent on form that particular day
4569893 well see the great wall and we were invited to the us ambassador to chinas house for an after party
4569894 you should have seen what happened at the white house
4569895 dude i was in the oval office for half an hour just chillin with the president well me and 16 other athletes we were around the desk and saw the artwork in the office he even knew i was on slipstream it was unreal then we had a rose garden affair and dinner with the president
4569896 they were on my bus this morning and we are flying with them instead of getting an emergency exit row i made sure to sit next to them because they are gorgeous im single i have to roll with it and make huff proud
4569897 one of the things that drew me to the project
4569898 but what do you use for the puke is the question on the office weve used cream of potato soup looks good from a distance but up close it looks milky
4569899 whether you do sweet puke or savory puke we came up with i think a mixture of applesauce and jell o with chunks of fruit in it it was actually kind of tasty
4569900 an abstract painter a science fiction novelist a business consultant and also a sewer truck dispatcher for most of my years growing up
4569901 for people of all religious faiths interested in where creativity and spirituality meet
4569902 i spent 2 1 2 years on a truck and bus tour doing shakespeare plays
4569903 so i had a little taste of the road life
4569904 i was always this close to moving to portland ore and teaching kids theater in summer camp or something like that
4569905 he did a little cameo at the bus stop reading the magazine that had vesuvius fishs original band on the cover
4569906 his line was something like well you cant always live your dream which got cut a really nice guy i got to hang out with him and interview him
4569907 we were terrible just absolutely the worst we auditioned for our high schools battle of the bands and didnt even get in
4569908 na jesse owens paavo nurmi en carl lewis is er nu phelps en dat hebben we nodig
4569909 we hebben hier altijd al goede concerten gespeeld en het belgische publiek heeft ons altijd gesteund
4569910 in europa spelen we telkens 2 weken en daarna vliegen we voor 2 weken terug naar de vs
4569911 maar ook wel spannend want precies omdat het zo lang geleden is weet je niet of de mensen het nog leuk vinden
4569912 we arent holding high hopes for a bumper crop of anything but lessons learned
4569913 a community committed to providing the highest quality live concerts in a lossless downloadable format
4569914 people with good taste people who break ground people who have a sense of passion humor and righteousness for what theyre covering

4569923 ive seen true evil you snake youre just like the boss no youre worse compared to you im not so bad
4569924 the team was established at the request of both governments to help bring about a peaceful closure to this matter consistent with the principles of justice and respect for human rights and dignity
4569925 the united states commends the government of cameroon and the government of nigeria for their commitment to the peaceful handover of the bakassi peninsula on august 14 2008 the united states continues to encourage the two governments to implement the 2002 international court of justice ruling and the 2006 greentree agreement we believe the efforts of cameroon and nigeria to resolve this border dispute peacefully serve as a positive example of conflict resolution
4569926 it is hard to imagine that anyone who loves nigeria will insist that we go ahead to implement the green tree agreement as it is in spite of the dangerous security implication which our military have pointed out
4569927 the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth
4569928 this expansion reinforces colorados standing as a national and international leader in clean modern energy for the future
4569929 i said to myself and apparently out loud one day that i thought it looked like glenn frey
4569930 i thought the woman who was in charge was going to hit me i didnt even mean it in a bad way it just looked like him from the 70s
4569931 o principal orador da noite de quarta feira dia 27 ser o candidato vice presid ncia de barack obama
4569932 a escolha de um candidato ao posto de vice presidente a decis o mais importante que um candidato levado a tomar durante a elei o presidencial
4569933 a perspectiva de dois governadores da virg nia se sucedendo duas noites consecutivas na conven o improv vel
4569934 n s nos reservamos a escolha de mudar o programa da conven o quando quisermos e voc s n o deveriam fazer especula es sobre isso
4569935 that being said we absolutely sympathize and understand the immense stress that our dmv workers are going through right now
4569936 as a direct result of those layoffs the amount of time customers spend waiting for service has been doubled
4569937 there wasnt any violence but we did have a crowd control issue in the interest of public safety we closed the office
4569938 zonder dat er concrete plannen zijn dat er op de redactie wordt ingegrepen heb ik de hele dag bezorgde en verontwaardige collegas gesproken er hangt een behoorlijke donkere wolk boven de basisweg in amsterdam
4569939 de krant maakt al vier kwartalen achtereen een lichte oplagegroei door en dat is een prestatie in het huidige klimaaat ook digitaal is de telegraaf een succes onze ambitie is veruit het grootste dagblad van nederland te blijven en een van de grootste in europa het is onze wens dat deze ambitie ook bij de aandeelhouders en de raad van bestuur leeft
4569940 geen staat kan blij zijn met vertegenwoordigers van een militair blok waartoe men niet behoort pal aan zijn grenzen
4569941 het zou lijken alsof we rusland een veto geven over wie er navo lid mag worden
4569942 we zullen de georgi rs verdrijven we hebben daar de troepen en het materiaal voor
4569943 we houden ons het recht voor georgische steden te treffen

4569945 the last thing any organization wants to do is lay off employees
4569946 it was one of those things that was a really tough decision to make but the longer you wait the deeper the cuts could have been
4569947 we will be working individually with each employee to make that determination
4569948 hey if you dont get on the bus you dont have to go to the end of the line
4569949 we dont need to wait a the end of the line lets go
4569950 sure was a long line when we waited the first time
4569951 cant go to the end of the line after your bus is full like ours was or youll spend your evening in line
4569952 americans regard democracy as something more transcendent something more sacred than just counting noses
4569953 americans at base want to know that their politics is about what is right and if a majority wants to do what is wrong people just dont roll over
4569954 just that very basic principle of recognizing the humanity of blacks was huge
4569955 with the beginning of the school year just weeks away it is important that we do all we can to ensure that our schools are as safe as possible for students and teachers alike
4569956 it is indeed unfortunate any time violence enters the school if teachers and students fear for their own personal safety while at school our entire educational system suffers
4569957 a gente chegou do almo o e disparou o alarme ent o recebi uma liga o para deixarmos o pr dio e tiramos todos do andar pela escada
4569958 todo grande projeto necessita se transformar para transcender e hoje n s estamos iniciando esse processo

4569961 whats wrong with a couple of currently serving united states senators going to georgia and assessing things
4569962 well to begin with they went at the behest of mccain
4569963 citizens of chicago are spoiled and should pay higher wages to them
4569964 of course fox i is biased but the rest of the media is biased toward the left media people who donated to a candidate were found to donate 80 to a democrat try looking up some articles on google
4569965 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
4569966 obama had to shift ground in order to explain a voting record more centrist on the iraq war than the words of his unrecorded but highly touted antiwar speech would suggest
4569967 mccains strength involves policy issues especially with a general electorate that in the united states is still today more center right politically than it is far left
4569968 mccain should advocate continuing the bush tax cuts and exploring private enterprise solutions to our nations health needs
4569969 repeat the reliable republican objections that universal health care would be another bottomless democratic pit nothing more than a social welfare giveaway that would destroy the private health care system
4569970 in our analysis of obamas experience as a chicago community organizer trained in saul alinskys radical socialist methodologies we warned change a slogan first introduced by alinsky was nothing more than a code word for the typical income redistribution those on the left have sought since the days of karl marx here in obamas proposal for increasing the capital gains tax we find proof for the point
4569971 obama like dukakis is vulnerable to negative information about his past that can burst any cult of personality bubble that public relations experts such as axelrod can try to create around a political persona
4569972 because we do not demonstrate moral leadership other nations have no choice but to proliferate nuclear weapons at the base of the argument obama is saying a world with nuclear weapons is our fault
4569973 wall street investment firms and u s law firms representing multinational u s corporations in their global operations lead the list of obama bundling contributors
4569974 a person who has to hide his or her smoking appears to be living in a lie moreover new age guys do not smoke new age guys who smoke out of sight cannot be trusted a new age politician dreaming of change and hoping for the future is not an image consistent with a guy who has to smoke cigarettes on campaign breaks just to make it through the day maybe thats the way obama takes such care to maintain the pretense he is a nonsmoker the smoker image conflicts with the campaign personality axelrod is trying to craft so much so that obama hid the habit from a reporter who had become like a friend to him if obama takes pains to hide his smoking from us what else does he take pains to hide
4569975 obamas secret smoking may not be a trivial issue after all looked at from a certain perspective the habit is a crack in the wall a flaw that calls into question whether the persona axelrod has crafted for obama is who obama really is or simply the person axelrod wants us to see
4569976 defeating obama will require removing the mask axelrod has placed before obamas face so that important segments of the electorate can fully appreciate how radical and politically unacceptable to them his policy views truly are
4569977 michelle might have been raised by a middle class black working family on chicagos south side but while being educated at an ivy league school she indulged in the luxury of experiencing alienation instead of being grateful for the opportunity nor was the impression diminished when the public learned that michelle like barack also got her law degree at harvard in 1988
4569978 non qualified pension restoration plan benefit will be paid in a lump sum rather than forfeited
4569979 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
4569980 of course fox i is biased but the rest of the media is biased toward the left media people who donated to a candidate were found to donate 80 to a democrat try looking up some articles on google

4569992 we are still working on too many drops we have to do a better job of concentrating and focusing
4569993 this is a good group when they work hard and they focus and pay attention to detail they are pretty average when they dont
4569994 that is his job when we are not doing something right coach dykes has to let us know and that is his way of telling us we were not doing our jobs
4569995 we bounced back it was good to see that from the offense we have a lot of weapons across the board
4569996 they have to step up their game and have to understand that in this offense you have to rely on these guys you have to be able to rely on them every single down
4569997 we are working through that they have to be reliable and consistent
4569998 it is good for us we are going to play five games on the road this year so when you can pack your gear up and go to an environment you are not used to i think it is good for your players especially our young players
4569999 this is the first time they have traveled and been in this kind of an environment and have a chance to go out and perform
